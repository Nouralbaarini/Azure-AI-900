For many of us, it's our go-to form of contact. When you have a question at work, you might reach out to a colleague using a chat message, which you can use on mobile devices, so you're always in touch.\n","\n","![A human and a robot having a conversation](./images/conversational_ai.jpg)\n","\n","Bots are AI agents that communicate using these kinds of channels, enabling a natural, conversational engagement with software services.\n","\n","## Create a QnA Maker Knowledge Base\n","\n","For customer support scenarios, it's common to create a bot that can interpret and answer frequently asked questions through a website chat window, email, or voice interface. Underlying the bot interface is a knowledge base of questions and appropriate answers that the bot can search for suitable responses.\n","\n","The QnA Maker service is a cognitive service in Azure that enables you to quickly create a knowledge base, either by entering question and answer pairs or from an existing document or web page. It can then use some built-in natural language processing capabilities to interpret questions and find appropriate answers.\n","\n","1. Open another browser tab and go to the QnA Maker portal at https://qnamaker.ai. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.\n","2. In the QnA Maker portal, select **Create a knowledge base**.\n","3. If you haven't previously created a QnA service resource, select **Create a QnA service**. The Azure portal will be opened in another tab so you can create a QnA Maker service in your subscription.

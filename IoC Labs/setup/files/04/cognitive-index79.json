Making the problem worse, there is no specific antiviral drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 to date. SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein. Therefore, molecules that can block SARS-CoV-2 from binding to hACE2 may potentially prevent the virus from entering human cells and serve as an effective antiviral drug. Based on this idea, we designed a series of peptides that can strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD in computational experiments. Specifically, we first constructed a 31-mer peptidic scaffold by linking two fragments grafted from hACE2 (a.a. 22-44 and 351-357) with a linker glycine, and then redesigned the peptide sequence to enhance its binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Compared with several computational studies that failed to identify that SARS-CoV-2 shows higher binding affinity for hACE2 than SARS-CoV, our protein design scoring function, EvoEF2, makes a correct identification, which is consistent with the recently reported experimental data, implying its high accuracy. The top designed peptide binders exhibited much stronger binding potency to hACE2 than the wild-type (\u221253.35 vs. \u221246.46 EvoEF2 energy unit for design and wild-type, respectively). The extensive and detailed computational analyses support the high reasonability of the designed binders, which not only recapitulated the critical native binding interactions but also introduced new favorable interactions to enhance binding. Due to the urgent situation created by COVID-19, we share these computational data to the community, which should be helpful to develop potential antiviral peptide drugs to combat this pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Xiaoqiang; Pearce, Robin; Zhang, Yang","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e8e21faa69a8a8919a3f07615ffc08ea1627f8d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.013607","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","hACE2","higher binding affinity","stronger binding potency","receptor binding domain","critical native binding interactions","RBD","computational data","designed peptide binders","designed binders","computational experiments","computational studies","potential antiviral peptide drugs","peptide sequence","human cells","detailed computational analyses","wild-type","specific antiviral drug","effective antiviral drug","outbreak of COVID","high reasonability","protein design scoring function","high accuracy","spike protein","experimental data","global pandemic","new favorable interactions","EvoEF2 energy unit","angiotensin","fragments","entry","correct identification","threatening lives","economic stability","mer peptidic scaffold","community","virus","enzyme","problem worse","series of peptides","urgent situation","molecules","linker glycine","idea","date"],"language":"en"},

The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, combined with a lack of population immunity and prevalence of severe clinical outcomes, urges the rapid development of effective therapeutic countermeasures. Here, we report the generation of synthetic nanobodies, known as sybodies, against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. In an expeditious process taking only twelve working days, sybodies were selected entirely in vitro from three large combinatorial libraries, using ribosome and phage display. We obtained six strongly enriched sybody pools against the isolated RBD and identified 63 unique anti-RBD sybodies which also interact in the context of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain. Among the selected sybodies, six were found to bind to the viral spike with double-digit nanomolar affinity, and five of these also showed substantial inhibition of RBD interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Additionally, we identified a pair of anti-RBD sybodies that can simultaneously bind to the RBD. It is anticipated that compact binders such as these sybodies could feasibly be developed into an inhalable drug that can be used as a convenient prophylaxis against COVID-19. Moreover, generation of polyvalent antivirals, via fusion of anti-RBD sybodies to additional small binders recognizing secondary epitopes, could enhance the therapeutic potential and guard against escape mutants. We present full sequence information and detailed protocols for the identified sybodies, as a freely accessible resource.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walter, Justin D.; Hutter, Cedric A.J.; Zimmermann, Iwan; Wyss, Marianne; Earp, Jennifer; Egloff, Pascal; Sorgenfrei, Mich\u00E8le; H\u00FCrlimann, Lea M.; Gonda, Imre; Meier, Gianmarco; Remm, Sille; Thavarasah, Sujani; Plattet, Philippe; Seeger, Markus A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2c783e2fa7ae3ddd7eb4666b63c051e52345cd0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.045419","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identified sybodies","selected sybodies","fusion of anti-RBD sybodies","unique anti-RBD sybodies","pair of anti-RBD sybodies","isolated RBD","full-length SARS-CoV","substantial inhibition of RBD interaction","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","high transmissibility of SARS","COVID","therapeutic potential","viral spike","spike ectodomain","compact binders","additional small binders","generation of polyvalent antivirals","generation of synthetic nanobodies","rapid development of effective therapeutic countermeasures","prevalence of severe clinical outcomes","human angiotensin","secondary epitopes","ribosome","detailed protocols","economic crisis of unprecedented scale","lack of population immunity","global health","receptor-binding domain","large combinatorial libraries","enzyme","double-digit nanomolar affinity","guard","escape mutants","working days","enriched sybody pools","context","phage display","sequence information","expeditious process","pandemic","accessible resource","ACE2","convenient prophylaxis","inhalable drug"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Between 30 March and 4 April 2020, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among pupils, their parents and siblings, as well as teachers and non-teaching staff of a high-school located in Oise. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered history of fever and/or respiratory symptoms since 13 January 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on antibody detection. Blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between 23 and 27 March 2020 in the Oise department were also tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Findings: Of the 661 participants (median age: 37 years), 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall IAR was 25.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 22.6-29.4), and the infection fatality rate was 0% (one-sided 97.5% CI = 0-2.1). Nine of the ten participants hospitalised since mid-January were in the infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3% (95% CI = 2.4-9.8). Anosmia and ageusia had high positive predictive values for SARS-CoV-2 infection (84.7% and 88.1%, respectively). Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non-smokers (7.2% versus 28.0%, P \u003C0.001). The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0% (95% CI = 11.2-23.4). The proportion of donors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks of the Oise department was 3.0% (95% CI = 1.1-6.4). Interpretation: The relatively low IAR observed in an area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated weeks before confinement measures indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that lifting these measures in France will be long and complex.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fontanet, Arnaud; Tondeur, Laura; Madec, Yoann; Grant, Rebecca; Besombes, Camille; Jolly, Nathalie; Fernandes Pellerin, Sandrine; Ungeheuer, Marie-Noelle; Cailleau, Isabelle; Kuhmel, Lucie; Temmam, Sarah; Huon, Christele; Chen, Kuang-Yu; Crescenzo, Bernadette; Munier, Sandie; Demeret, Caroline; Grzelak, Ludivine; Staropoli, Isabelle; Bruel, Timothee; Gallian, Pierre; Cauchemez, Simon; van der Werf, Sylvie; Schwartz, Olivier; Eloit, Marc; Hoen, Bruno","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55134bb8ff89ac7a3c730f4dc1f5a9ed144a817e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.18.20071134v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAR"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["confirmed SARS-CoV","presence of anti-SARS-CoV","antibodies","proportion of participants","Oise department","infection fatality rate","infection attack rate","Blood samples","lower IAR","low IAR","overall IAR","nearby blood banks","blood donor centres","proportion of donors","proportion of infected individuals","hospitalisation rate","France","high-school","confinement measures","infected group","respiratory symptoms","study period","high positive predictive values","retrospective closed cohort study","pupils","ageusia","years","non-teaching staff","circulated weeks","teachers","herd immunity","parents","Anosmia","history of fever","area","siblings","time","questionnaire","median age","Background","antibody detection","non-smokers","Interpretation","confidence interval","COVID","Findings","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The associations of clinical characteristics and treatment regimens on time to viral RNA clearance were analyzed. Results: We examined 284 consecutive COVID-19 cases, accounting for 82% of confirmed cases in Guangzhou during this period. At the time of reporting (20th March 2020), 276 (97.2%) had recovered and were discharged from hospital with a median hospital stay of 18 days (interquartile range [IQR]:13-24). Overall, 280 patients achieved viral RNA clearance with a median length of 12 days (IQR: 8-16) after onset of illness. Amongst them, 66.1% had viral RNA cleared within 14 days, and 89.3% within 21 days. Older age, severity of disease, time lag from illness onset to hospital admission, high body temperature, and corticosteroid use were associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA. None of the antiviral regimens (chloroquine, oseltamivir, arbidol, and lopinavir/ritonavir) improved viral RNA clearance. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA even after adjusting for confounders. Conclusion: In patients with COVID-19, isolation for a minimum of 21 days after onset of illness may be warranted, while the use of antiviral drugs does not enhance viral RNA clearance.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xudan; Zhang, Yang; Zhu, Baoyi; Zeng, Jianwen; Hong, Wenxin; He, Xi; Chen, Jingfeng; Zheng, Haipeng; Qiu, Shuang; Deng, Ying; Chan, Juliana; Wang, Jian","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbd35758e3c682c496db060580928217f156b3a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20058941","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Guangzhou Eighth People\u0027s Hospital"],"locations":["Guangzhou"],"keyphrases":["viral RNA clearance","delayed clearance of viral RNA","days","median hospital","confirmed COVID","onset of illness","illness onset","patients","hospital admission","consecutive COVID","People\u0027s Hospital","use of lopinavir","treatment regimens","time lag","antiviral regimens","ritonavir","corticosteroid use","time of reporting","confirmed cases","use of antiviral drugs","Guangzhou","IQR","optimal isolation period","severity of disease","treatment strategies","median length","novel coronavirus disease","high body temperature","global pandemic","factors","oseltamivir","arbidol","accounting","associations of clinical characteristics","chloroquine","respiratory symptoms","Older age","retrospective study","interquartile range","Background","minimum","Methods","Results","Conclusion","confounders"],"language":"en"},

At the same time, oseltamivir, as an over-the-counter drug, is also a popular antiviral drug. As healthcare workers fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have found that many patients experiencing discomfort or considered to be infected with a virus take oseltamivir. From severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 to middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and now the current COVID-19 epidemic, there is not plenty of evidence showing that oseltamivir is effective against coronavirus. Still, there is also no sufficient evidence to refute its ineffectiveness. We cannot predict whether there will be a pandemic of respiratory coronavirus in the future, so we hope to initiate such research and preliminarily explore whether oseltamivir is effective for COVID-19, which can better guide healthcare workers in the selection of appropriate antiviral drugs in the face of coronavirus epidemics.

Moreover, stark differences in age distribution by race and ethnicity groups are seldom accounted for in analyses. Methods: To address these gaps, we conducted a cross-sectional study using publicly-reported Covid-19 mortality data to assess the quality of race and ethnicity data (Black, Latinx, white), and estimated age-adjusted disparities using a random effects meta-analytic approach. Results: We found only 28 states, and NYC, reported race and ethnicity-stratified Covid-19 mortality along with large variation in the percent of missing race and ethnicity data by state. Aggregated relative risk of death estimates for Black compared to the white population was 3.57 (95% CI: 2.84-4.48). Similarly, Latinx population displayed 1.88 (95% CI: 1.61-2.19) times higher risk of death than white patients. Discussion: In states providing race and ethnicity data, we identified significant population-level Covid-19 mortality disparities. We demonstrated the importance of adjusting for age differences across population groups to prevent underestimating disparities in younger population groups. The availability of high-quality and comprehensive race and ethnicity data is necessary to address factors contributing to inequity in Covid-19 mortality.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gross, C.

The advent of the internet has opened new possibilities for interaction, collaboration and networking, yet the uptake of tools enabling remote participation at scientific meetings has been slow. Academic conferences have become more international with high proliferation in the number of meetings and attendees, but the format and quality of their organization lags behind what is possible. As a result, the experience of attending conferences in many disciplines today is not appreciably different in many respects. A few conferences in some disciplines have recently implemented valuable changes for the community and have become more receptive to attendees with families. Many meetings could still be improved significantly in terms of diversity, inclusivity, promoting early career researcher (ECR) networking and career development, venue accessibility, and more importantly, reducing the meetings\u2019 carbon footprint. These issues are openly visible and to some extent discussed among researchers on social media. It is important to accelerate and mandate these efforts so that researchers in all disciplines, in particular ECRs, consistently benefit from scientific gatherings, for years to come. We examined the current state of over 260 national and international academic meetings in various disciplines for features of inclusivity and sustainability and propose solutions to make conferences more modern, effective, equitable and intellectually productive for the research community and environmentally sustainable for our planet. \u201CThey always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.\u201D \u2014 Andy Warhol","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarabipour, Sarvenaz; Schwessinger, Benjamin; Mumoki, Fiona N.; Mwakilili, Aneth D.; Khan, Aziz; Debat, Humberto J.; S\u00E1ez, Pablo J.; Seah, Samantha; Mestrovic, Tomislav","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c86dde4e07e6c295d41960bdde42d9196918a2dd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.022079","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Andy Warhol"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Scientific conferences","scientific meetings","Academic conferences","various disciplines","researchers","international academic meetings","number of meetings","networking","career stages","career development","scientific gatherings","valuable changes","attendees","early career researcher","features of inclusivity","valuable opportunities","research community","time changes things","uptake of tools","remote participation","new possibilities","interaction","collaboration","sustainability","high proliferation","internet","extent","latest work","venue accessibility","format","solutions","particular ECRs","organization","quality","social media","terms of diversity","efforts","experience","current state","meetings\u2019 carbon footprint","peers","advent","families","planet","years","result","Andy Warhol","issues","respects"],"language":"en"},

At present, confirmatory diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), typically taking several hours and requiring a molecular laboratory to perform. There is an urgent need for rapid, simplified and cost-effective detection methods. We have developed and analytically validated a protocol for direct rapid extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid purification. As few as 6 RNA copies per reaction of viral nucleocapsid (N) gene from respiratory samples such as sputum and nasal exudate can be detected directly using our one-step inhibitor-resistant assay. The performance of this assay was validated on a commercially available portable PCR thermocycler. Viral lysis, reverse transcription, amplification and detection are achieved in a single-tube homogeneous reaction within 36 minutes. This minimized hands-on time, reduces turnaround-time for sample-to-result and obviates the need for RNA purification reagents. It could enable wider use of Covid-19 testing for diagnosis, screening and research in countries and regions where laboratory capabilities are limiting.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wee, Soon Keong; Sivalingam, Suppiah Paramalingam; Yap, Eric Peng Huat","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b474063626a7252e805485399a1f13a7f095e03.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.042366","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DIRECT-PCR","RT-PCR","detection of SARS","direct rapid extraction-free PCR","reaction of viral nucleocapsid","SARS-CoV","urgent need","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","available portable PCR thermocycler","cost-effective detection methods","RNA purification reagents","respiratory samples","confirmatory diagnosis","Viral lysis","single-tube homogeneous reaction","turnaround-time","RNA copies","hands-on time","laboratory capabilities","molecular laboratory","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","wider use of Covid","nucleic acid purification","ongoing worldwide coronavirus disease","one-step inhibitor-resistant assay","testing","countries","research","regions","sputum","screening","pandemic","amplification","protocol","result","nasal exudate","minutes","present","hours","performance"],"language":"en"},

This may cause individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection to test negative according to serological diagnostic tests in the months and years following symptom onset. Methods A multiplex serological assay was developed to measure IgG and IgM antibody responses to four SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) antigens: spike trimeric ectodomain (Stri), its receptor-binding domain (RBD), spike subunit 1 (S1), and spike subunit 2 (S2). Antibody responses were measured in serum samples from patients in French hospitals with RT-qPCR confirmed infection (n = 259), and negative control serum samples collected before the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in 2019 (n = 335). The multiplex antibody data was used to train a random forests algorithm for classifying individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. A mathematical model of antibody kinetics informed by prior information from other coronaviruses was used to estimate time-varying antibody responses and assess the potential sensitivity and classification performance of serological diagnostics during the first year following symptom onset. Results IgG antibody responses to one S antigen identified individuals with previous RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with 90.3% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI); 86.1%, 93.4%) and 99.1% specificity (95% CI; 97.4%, 99.7%). Using a serological signature of IgG to four antigens, it was possible to identify infected individuals with 96.1% sensitivity (95% CI; 93.0%, 97.9%) and 99.1% specificity (95% CI; 97.4%, 99.7%). Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 increase rapidly 1-2 weeks after symptom onset, with antibody responses predicted to peak within 2-4 weeks. Informed by prior data from other coronaviruses, one year following symptom onset antibody responses are predicted to decay by approximately 60% from the peak response. Depending on the selection of sero-positivity cutoff, we estimate that the sensitivity of serological diagnostics may reduce to 56%-97% after six months, and to 49%-93% after one year. Conclusion Serological signatures based on antibody responses to multiple antigens can provide more accurate and robust serological classification of individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in antibody levels over time may cause reductions in the sensitivity of serological diagnostics leading to an underestimation of sero-prevalence. It is essential that data continue to be collected to evaluate this potential risk.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosado, J.; Cockram, C.; Merkling, S.

Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We compared the clinical features on admission among patients who were diagnosed with asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19 at the end of observation. Methods: This retrospective, single-center study included 104 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from the mass infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship from February 11 to February 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were followed up until February 26, 2020. Clinical features on admission were compared among those with different disease severity at the end of observation. Univariate analysis identified factors associated with symptom onset and disease progression. Findings: The median age was 68 years, and 54 patients were male. Briefly, 43, 41, and 20 patients on admission and 33, 43, and 28 patients at the end of observation had asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19, respectively. Serum lactate hydrogenase levels were significantly higher in 10 patients who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared with 33 patients who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period. Older age, consolidation on chest computed tomography, and lymphopenia on admission were more frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 than those with mild COVID-19 at the end of observation. Interpretation: Lactate dehydrogenase level is a potential predictor of symptom onset in COVID-19. Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression of COVID-19 and contribute to the clinical management.

Objective: Estimation of (1) the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 that can occur and (2) timing of transmission relative to symptom onset. Design: Secondary analysis of published data Data sources: Meta-analysis of COVID-19 incubation period and a rapid systematic review of serial interval and generation time, which are published separately. Methods: Simulations were generated of incubation period and of serial interval or generation time. From these, transmission times relative to symptom onset were calculated and the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was estimated. Results: A total of 23 estimates of serial interval and five estimates of generation time from 17 publications were included. These came from nine different data source categories (presented here in descending order of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission): Hong Kong, Tianjin, pooled data from Hong Kong and Shenzhen, Singapore, Mainland China excluding Hubei, mixed sources, Shenzhen, northern Italy and Wuhan. Transmission time relative to symptom onset ranged from a mean of 2.05 days before symptom onset for Hong Kong to 1.72 days after symptom onset for Wuhan. Proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission ranged from 33.7% in Wuhan to 72.7% in Hong Kong. Based on individual estimates, transmission time relative to symptom onset ranged from mean of 2.95 days before symptom onset to 1.72 days after symptom onset and proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission ranged from 33.7% to 79.9%. Simple unweighted pooling of estimates based on serial intervals resulted in a mean time of transmission of 0.67 days before symptoms, and an estimated 56.1% of transmission occurring in the pre-symptomatic period. Conclusions: Contact rates between symptomatic infectious and susceptible people are likely to influence the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission. There is substantial potential for pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 in a range of different contexts. Our work suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is most likely in the day before symptom onset whereas estimates suggesting most pre-symptomatic transmission highlighted a mean transmission times almost 3 days before symptom onset. These findings highlight the urgent need for extremely rapid and effective case detection, contact tracing and quarantine measures if strict social distancing measures are to be eased.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Casey, M.; Griffin, J.; McAloon, C.

With its high prevalence of chronic non-degenerative diseases, it is suspected that in Mexico there is a high risk of fatal complications from COVID-19. The present study aims to estimate the risk factors for hospitalisation and death in the Mexican population infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods and Findings. We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud, SS). All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between the hospitalisation and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68% men), with mean age 46.47 SD 15.62, were analysed. Men were about 1.54 times as likely to be hospitalized than women (p\u003C0.001, 95% C.I. 1.37-1.74); individuals aged 50-74 and \u003E=74 years were more likely to be hospitalized than people from 25-49 years (OR 2.05, p\u003C0.001, 95% C.I. 1.81-2.32, and OR 23.84, p\u003C0.001, 95% C.I. 2.90-5.15, respectively). People with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalised than people without these morbidities (p\u003C0.01). Men had more risk of death in comparison to women (OR=1.53, p\u003C0.001, 95% C.I. 1.30-1.81) and individuals aged 50-74 and [\u2265]75 years were more likely to die than people from 25-49 years (OR 1.96, p\u003C0.001, 95% C.I. 1.63-2.34, and OR 3.74, p\u003C0.001, 95% C.I. 2.80-4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination, provided a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases (OR=2.10; p\u003C0.001, 95% C.I. 1.50-2.93). Hospitalisation, intubation and pneumonia conferred a higher risk of dying (OR 5.02, p\u003C0.001, 95% C.I. 3.88-6.50; OR 4.27, p\u003C0.001, 95% C.I. 3.26-5.59, and OR=2.57; p\u003C0.001, 95% C.I. 2.11-3.13, respectively). The main limitation of our study is the lack of information on mild (asymptomatic) or moderate cases of COVID-19. Conclusions. The present study points out that in Mexico, where an important proportion of the population develops two or more chronic conditions simultaneously, high mortality is a sever outcome for those infected by SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carrillo-Vega, M.

It is important to identify the factors which can weaken the virus, and the nations which are more vulnerable to this virus. Materials and Methods: Data of weather, vaccination trends, life expectancy, lung disease, number of infected people in the pre-lockdown and post-lockdown period of highly infected nations are collected. These are extracted from authentic online resources and published reports. Analysis is done to find the possible impact of each parameter on CoVid19. Results: CoVid19 has no linear correlation with any of the selected parameters, though few parameters have depicted non-linear relationship in the graphs. Further investigations have shown better result for some parameters. A combination of the parameters results in a better correlation with infection rate.

Perceived adaptation of the community to lockdown ({beta}=2.64, 95% CI 1.25 -4.03), fears/worries concerning one\u0027s health ({beta}=2.87, 95% CI 0.04-5.70), residing in large cities ({beta}=19.40, 95% CI 13.78-25.03), access to official COVID19 information sources ({beta}=16.45, 95% CI 6.82-26.08), and belonging to the healthcare sector ({beta}=22.53, 95% CI 16.00-29.07) were associated with a higher adherence score to anti -COVID instructions. The study indicates excellent preventive behavior of the Vietnamese population which explains the low number of COVID-19 infections and zero recorded mortality up to the first week of May 2020. Further monitoring is recommended to assess the sustainability of COVID-19 prevention via behavior change in the medium and long-term.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thang, T.

Two closely related innate immunity genes, CD209 and CD209L, are particularly interesting because they directly recognize a plethora of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Both genes, which result from an ancient duplication, possess a neck region, made up of seven repeats of 23 amino acids each, known to play a major role in the pathogen-binding properties of these proteins. To explore the extent to which pathogens have exerted selective pressures on these innate immunity genes, we resequenced them in a group of samples from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and East Asia. Moreover, variation in the number of repeats of the neck region was defined in the entire Human Genome Diversity Panel for both genes. Our results, which are based on diversity levels, neutrality tests, population genetic distances, and neck-region length variation, provide genetic evidence that CD209 has been under a strong selective constraint that prevents accumulation of any amino acid changes, whereas CD209L variability has most likely been shaped by the action of balancing selection in non-African populations. In addition, our data point to the neck region as the functional target of such selective pressures: CD209 presents a constant size in the neck region populationwide, whereas CD209L presents an excess of length variation, particularly in non-African populations. An additional interesting observation came from the coalescent-based CD209 gene tree, whose binary topology and time depth (\u223C2.8 million years ago) are compatible with an ancestral population structure in Africa. Altogether, our study has revealed that even a short segment of the human genome can uncover an extraordinarily complex evolutionary history, including different pathogen pressures on host genes as well as traces of admixture among archaic hominid populations.","publish_time":"2005-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barreiro, Luis B.; Patin, Etienne; Neyrolles, Olivier; Cann, Howard M.; Gicquel, Brigitte; Quintana-Murci, Llu\u00EDs","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1271393/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Human Genome Diversity Panel"],"locations":["sub-Saharan Africa","Europe","East Asia","Africa"],"keyphrases":["neck-region length variation","neck region populationwide","innate immunity genes","host genes","selective pressures","non-African populations","innate immunity system","different pathogen pressures","CD209L variability","excess of length variation","plethora of pathogens","coalescent-based CD209 gene tree","population genetic distances","strong selective constraint","archaic hominid populations","entire Human Genome Diversity Panel","genetic evidence","diversity levels","sub-Saharan Africa","number of repeats","amino acids","pathogen-binding properties","ancestral population structure","amino acid changes","line of host defense","additional interesting observation","binary topology","constant size","accumulation","neutrality tests","complex evolutionary history","traces of admixture","functional target","Europe","action of balancing selection","time depth","bacteria","data point","group of samples","East Asia","major role","short segment","ancient duplication","years","proteins","viruses","parasites","extent","study","results"],"language":"en"},

Some adjuvants, including mineral oil, are known to induce arthritis in certain strains of rats after intradermal injection or percutaneous application. The aim of this study was to determine if common commercial cosmetic products containing mineral oil could induce arthritis in the highly susceptible DA (Dark Agouti) rat. Intradermal injection of five out of eight assayed cosmetic products without further additives resulted in arthritis with synovitis. One of the products induced a very aggressive arthritis, which had declined after 5-9 weeks. When this product was also assayed for arthritogenicity upon percutaneous administration, it induced a mild and transient arthritis in 5 out of 10 DA rats, whereas control animals showed no clinical signs of joint involvement. No arthritic reaction was seen in rats after peroral feeding with the most arthritogenic product or by intravaginal application of Freund\u0027s adjuvants. Silicone gel implants in DA rats did not cause arthritis. We conclude that mineral oils included in common commercially available products retain their adjuvant properties and are arthritogenic in the presently investigated arthritis-prone rat strain.

This finding allows a direct comparison of two different models for rheumatoid arthritis; one induced with a defined auto-immunogen and one with a pure adjuvant. Both CIA and OIA develop approximately 2 weeks after induction but OIA is a self-limited acute disease whereas CIA induced with homologous CII follows a chronic disease course. Immunization with CII leads to a strong autoantibody response to CII while injection of FIA leads to no or very limited anti-CII antibody response. The Lewis rat develops neither CIA nor OIA while F1 (DA x Lewis) rats develop CIA but not OIA. Olive oil or CII emulsified in olive oil does not induce arthritis in DA rats. Pretreatment with CII in olive oil vaccinates against CIA but not OIA whereas pretreatment with FIA vaccinates against OIA but not CIA.

This was followed approximately 10 min later by the addition of both galactose and sialic acid to give the mature oligosaccharides. This sequence of additions was confirmed by analyzing the 3H-labeled oligosaccharides bound to each of the E1 forms using gel filtration on P4 columns. The intracellular location of the first step was determined by exploiting the temperature sensitivity of virus release. The virus normally buds first into a smooth membrane compartment lying between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the cis side of the Golgi stack (Tooze et al., 1984). At 31 degrees C the virus is assembled but does not appear to enter the Golgi stacks.

It has recently been reported that the organization of the Golgi complex is disrupted in cells treated with the fungal metabolite, brefeldin-A. Under these conditions, it was shown that resident enzymes of the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi return to the ER. We report here that 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors, when pulse- labeled within the ER of brefeldin-A-treated cells, acquired numerous N- linked galactose residues with a half time of approximately 2 h, as measured by their ability to bind to RCA-I lectin affinity columns. In contrast, Limax flavus lectin chromatography revealed that less than 10% of these receptors acquired sialic acid after 8 h in brefeldin-A. Two lines of evidence suggested that proteins within and beyond the TGN did not return to the ER in the presence of brefeldin-A. First, the majority of 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors present in the TGN and endosomes did not return to the ER after up to 6 h in brefeldin-A, as determined by their failure to contact galactosyltransferase that had relocated there. Moreover, although mannose 6-phosphate receptors did not acquire sialic acid when present in the ER of brefeldin-A-treated cells, they were readily sialylated when labeled at the cell surface and transported to the TGN. These experiments indicate that galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme, returns to the endoplasmic reticulum in the presence of brefeldin-A, while the bulk of sialyltransferase, a resident of the TGN, does not.

The hybrid protein carrying the wild-type repressor domain is mostly secreted to the cell surface, whereas hybrid proteins with amino acid substitutions that cause the repressor domain to be thermodynamically unstable are retained intracellularly. Surprisingly, the retained hybrids are found in the vacuole, where the repressor moiety is degraded by vacuolar proteases. The following observations indicate that receptor-mediated recognition of the mutant repressor domain in the Golgi lumen targets these hybrid fusions to the vacuole. (a) The invertase-repressor fusions, like wild-type invertase, behave as soluble proteins in the ER lumen. (b) Targeting to the vacuole is saturable since overexpression of the hybrids carrying mutant repressor increases the fraction of fusion protein that appears at the cell surface. (c) Finally, deletion of the VPS10 gene, which encodes the transmembrane Golgi receptor responsible for targeting carboxypeptidase Y to the vacuole, causes the mutant hybrids to be diverted to the cell surface.

The mutant protein accumulated in the trans-Golgi, as judged from the acquisition of trans-Golgi-specific modifications of the protein and from the immunofluorescence staining pattern. It was localized to juxtanuclear, tubular structures that were also stained by antibodies against galactosyltransferase and gamma-adaptin. The results of further mutagenesis in the cytoplasmic domain indicated that the size rather than the specific sequence of the cytoplasmic domain determines whether H1 is retained in the trans-Golgi or transported to the cell surface. Truncation to less than 17 residues resulted in retention, and extension of a truncated tail by an unrelated sequence restored surface transport. The transmembrane segment of H1 was not sufficient for retention of a reporter molecule and it could be replaced by an artificial apolar sequence without affecting Golgi localization. The cytoplasmic domain thus appears to inhibit interaction(s) of the exoplasmic portion of H1 with trans-Golgi component(s) for example by steric hindrance or by changing the positioning of the protein in the membrane.

It is concluded that larger SOMs, as well as taking longer to train, are less sensitive in phylogenetic classification of unknown DNA sequences.

Increasing the number of iterations in the training phase of the SOM only slightly increases accuracy, without improving sensitivity. The optimal length of the DNA sequence k-mer from which the genome signature should be derived is 4 or 5, but shorter values are almost as effective.

Tylophorine derivatives exhibit anti-cancer activities but their cellular targets remain unknown. We used a biotinylated tylophorine derivative to probe for the interacting cellular target(s) of tylophorine. Tylophorine directly binds to caprin-1 and consequently enhances the recruitment of G3BP1, c-Myc mRNA, and cyclin D2 mRNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex. Subsequently, this tylophorine targeted ribonucleoprotein complex is sequestered to the polysomal fractions and the protein expressions of the associated mRNA-transcripts are repressed. Caprin-1 depleted carcinoma cells become more resistant to tylophorine, associated with decreased formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex targeted by tylophorine. Consequently, tylophorine downregulates c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2, causing hypophosphorylation of Rb and suppression of both processing-body formation and the Warburg effect. Gene expression profiling and gain-of-c-Myc-function experiments also revealed that the downregulated c-Myc contributes to the anti-oncogenic effects of tylophorine compounds. Furthermore, the potent tylophorine derivative dibenzoquinoline-33b elicited a similar effect, as c-Myc protein levels were also decreased in xenograft tumors treated with dibenzoquinoline-33b. Thus, tylophorine compounds exert anti-cancer activity predominantly by targeting and sequestering the caprin-1 protein and c-Myc mRNA associated ribonucleoprotein complex.","publish_time":"2014-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Ya-Qi; Yang, Cheng-Wei; Lee, Yue-Zhi; Yang, Ruey-Bing; Lee, Chih-Hao; Hsu, Hsing-Yu; Chang, Chien-Chung; Lee, Shiow-Ju","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9de48553eac5b5676f0e796f544e04634d39aaa4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ad4f830c6a0985b878a66d4e797232ccba91aedc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4385842.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4385842/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tylophorine"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Tylophorine derivatives","tylophorine targeted ribonucleoprotein complex","biotinylated tylophorine derivative","c-Myc mRNA associated ribonucleoprotein complex","downregulated c-Myc","potent tylophorine derivative dibenzoquinoline","c-Myc protein levels","anti-oncogenic effects of tylophorine compounds","caprin","associated mRNA-transcripts","cyclin D2 mRNA","anti-cancer activities","protein expressions","anti-cancer activity","decreased formation","cellular targets","similar effect","Warburg effect","processing-body formation","interacting cellular target","cyclins D1","suppression","gain","depleted carcinoma cells","hypophosphorylation of Rb","polysomal fractions","function experiments","focus of drug development","xenograft tumors","Gene expression profiling","recruitment of G3BP1","decades"],"language":"en"},

Lung injury with severe respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory failure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in COVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified tetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating lung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene expression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human COVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that twelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value\u003C0.05) overlap between HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues, including signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these twelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of twelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also uniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In summary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms leading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and CGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Bing; Garmire, Lana","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/966463a65f9f6bc17d132aa3fbbde84b2c9c3890.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14333v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNF","MAPK","Chemokine","RHOA","CALR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induced lung injury","human COVID","lung injuries","patient lung tissues","plausible mechanism of lung injury","COL","ACE2 inhibitor","ACE2 inhibition","treated HCC515 cells","enriched pathways","CGP","severe respiratory failure","acute respiratory failure","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","SARS-CoV","RHOA","Coronavirus disease","common target genes","cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor","efficient treatment","Inhibition of Angiotensin","repurposed drugs","candidate drugs","infectious disease","gene expression patterns","spike protein of SARS","leading cause of death","mechanisms","FAS","CDC42","RAC2","study","potential","MAPK","TNF","P-value","abilities","Chemokine","enzyme","CALR","shares","bioinformatics analysis","modified tetracycline","summary","MMP14","compounds","outbreak","world"],"language":"en"},

While previous work either addressed shorter gaps or relied on exemplars by copying available information from other signal parts, GACELA addresses the inpainting of long gaps in two aspects. First, it considers various time scales of audio information by relying on five parallel discriminators with increasing resolution of receptive fields. Second, it is conditioned not only on the available information surrounding the gap, i.e., the context, but also on the latent variable of the conditional GAN. This addresses the inherent multi-modality of audio inpainting at such long gaps and provides the option of user-defined inpainting. GACELA was tested in listening tests on music signals of varying complexity and gap durations ranging from 375~ms to 1500~ms. While our subjects were often able to detect the inpaintings, the severity of the artifacts decreased from unacceptable to mildly disturbing.

For instance, infodemics can lead to hatred between population groups that fragment the society influencing its response or result in negative habits that help the pandemic propagate.

Since then, the disease has spread worldwide. As it currently spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States healthcare system. They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the curve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates. With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical evidence from China, South Korea, Italy and the United States that supports the insights from the model.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palomo, Sergio; Pender, Jamol; Massey, William; Hampshire, Robert C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/709f2dbfc5ee48f65ca835ef66ec9e3dc47746b1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09645v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","United States","America","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["curve","United States healthcare system","model","capacity of healthcare system","time evolution","elapsed time","peak demand","dynamical system","peak rate of hospitalizations","number of coronavirus patients","number of people","hospital resources","China","rate of new infections","infected people","worldwide outbreak","methods of queueing theory","rapid influx of patients","theory of infinite server queues","non-stationary Poisson arrival rates","South Korea","policy makers","public health officials","citizens","mitigation strategies","Italy","empirical evidence","social distancing","America","impact","order","pandemic","unnecessary fatalities","paper","insights","society","countries","Wuhan","disease"],"language":"en"},

Restrictions of this kind were important in the response to epidemics of SARS (2003), H1N1 influenza (2009), and Ebola (2014). However, they do not always work as expected. The imposition of a cordon sanitaire to control the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, for example, is argued to have led to a higher-than-expected number of cases in the quarantined area. To determine when mobility restrictions reduce the size of an epidemic, we use a model of disease transmission within and between economically heterogeneous locally connected communities. One community comprises a low-risk, resource-rich, low-density population with access to effective medical resources. The other comprises a high-risk, resource-poor, high-density population without access to effective medical resources. We find that the overall size of an epidemic centered in the high-risk community is sensitive to the stringency of mobility restrictions between the two communities. Unrestricted mobility between the two risk communities increases the number of secondary cases in the low-risk community but reduces the overall epidemic size. By contrast, the imposition of a cordon sanitaire around the high-risk community reduces the number of secondary infections in the low-risk community but increases the overall epidemic size. The degree to which mobility restrictions increase or decrease the overall epidemic size depends on the level of risk in each community and the characteristics of the disease.","publish_time":"2019-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Espinoza, Baltazar; Castillo-Chavez, Carlos; Perrings, Charles","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30bf8179a7859d1b72b82985e1f44b54f92d1f3d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05261v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["low-risk community","overall epidemic size","high-risk community","overall size","risk communities","stringency of mobility restrictions","Mobility restrictions - travel advisories","level of risk","Unrestricted mobility","number of secondary cases","expected number of cases","access","extreme cases","number of secondary infections","effective medical resources","cordon sanitaire","connected communities","imposition","high-density population","low-density population","resource-rich","resource-poor","area quarantines","quarantined area","model of disease transmission","West African Ebola outbreak","trade","border closures","cordons sanitaires","response","example","epidemics of SARS","kind","characteristics","H1N1 influenza","measures","infectious diseases","contrast","degree"],"language":"en"},

The scientific basis for our inquiry is the well-established fact that disease spread, especially in the initial stages, follows an exponential function meaning few positive cases can explode into a widespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently transmittable. We define prediction bias as the systematic error arising from faulty prediction of the number of cases x-weeks hence when presented with y-weeks of prior, actual data on the same. Our design permits us to identify the root of this under-prediction as an EGPB arising from the general tendency to underestimate the speed at which exponential processes unfold. Our data reveals that the\u0022degree of convexity\u0022reflected in the predicted path of the disease is significantly and substantially lower than the actual path. The bias is significantly higher for respondents from countries at a later stage relative to those at an early stage of disease progression. We find that individuals who exhibit EGPB are also more likely to reveal markedly reduced compliance with the WHO-recommended safety measures, find general violations of safety protocols less alarming, and show greater faith in their government\u0027s actions. A simple behavioral nudge which shows prior data in terms of raw numbers, as opposed to a graph, causally reduces EGPB. Clear communication of risk via raw numbers could increase accuracy of risk perception, in turn facilitating compliance with suggested protective behaviors.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, Ritwik; Bhattacharya, Joydeep; Majumdar, Priyama","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01273v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGPB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EGPB","exponential-growth prediction bias","prior data","faulty prediction","under-prediction","disease spread","actual data","exponential function","early stage of disease progression","data reveals","exponential processes","actual path","terms of raw numbers","general violations of safety protocols","positive cases","number of cases x-weeks","reduced compliance","general tendency","y-weeks","predicted path","accuracy of risk perception","recommended safety measures","Clear communication of risk","later stage relative","turn","countries","inquiry","respondents","importance","systematic error","greater faith","global experiment","well-established fact","initial stages","simple behavioral nudge","Amazon MTurk","suggested protective behaviors","speed","widespread pandemic","degree of convexity","government\u0027s actions","root","scientific basis","COVID","graph","outbreak","design","individuals"],"language":"en"},

In the current COVID-19 epidemic, it has been observed that major roads have enhanced its propagation in Italy. We propose a new simple model of propagation of epidemics which exhibits this effect and allows for a quantitative analysis. The model consists of a classical $SIR$ model with diffusion, to which an additional compartment is added, formed by the infected individuals travelling on a line of fast diffusion. Exchanges between individuals on the line and in the rest of the domain are taken into account. A classical transformation allows us to reduce the proposed model to a system analogous to one we had previously introduced [5] to describe the enhancement of biological invasions by lines of fast diffusion. We establish the existence of a minimal spreading speed and we show that it may be quite large, even when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is close to $1$.

With the announcement of the Apple/Google partnership to introduce contact-tracing functionality to iOS and Android, it seems likely that this will be adopted in many countries. An important part of the functionality of the app will be to decide whether a person should be advised to self-isolate, be tested or end isolation. However, the privacy preserving nature of the Apple/Google contact tracing algorithm means that centralised curation of these decisions is not possible so each phone must use its own\u0022risk model\u0022to inform decisions. Ideally, the risk model should use Bayesian inference to decide the best course of action given the test results of the user and those of other users. Here we present a decentralised algorithm that estimates the Bayesian posterior probability of viral transmission events and evaluates when a user should be notified, tested or released from isolation while preserving user privacy. The algorithm also allows the disease models on the phones to learn from everyone\u0027s contact-tracing data and will allow Epidemiologists to better understand the dynamics of the disease. The algorithm is a message passing algorithm, based on belief propagation, so each smart-phone can be used to execute a small part of the algorithm without releasing any sensitive information. In this way, the network of all participating smart-phones forms a distributed computation device that performs Bayesian inference, informs each user when they should start/end isolation or be tested and learns about the disease from user\u0027s data.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Daniel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7979650f5a8adbb039c03bc0c4b203f4a4f6db6f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05086v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Apple/Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Google contact tracing algorithm","decentralised algorithm","contact-tracing functionality","contact-tracing data","user privacy","Bayesian inference","disease models","end isolation","smart-phone apps","Apple","participating smart-phones","decisions","risk model","countries","Google partnership","user\u0027s data","Bayesian posterior probability of viral transmission events","distributed computation device","centralised curation","best course of action","iOS","test results","resurgences","network","Android","belief propagation","nature","self-isolate","COVID","pandemic","announcement","Epidemiologists","effort","message","initial outbreak","person","way","dynamics","sensitive information","users"],"language":"en"},

A rapid defeat of the pandemic requires carrying out on the population a mass screening, able to separate positive from negative cases. Such a cleaning will free a flow of productive population. The current rate and cost of testing, performed with the common PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method and with the available resources, is forcing a selection of the subjects to be tested. Indeed, each one must be examined individually at the cost of precious time. Moreover, the exclusion of potentially positive individuals from screening induces health risks, a broad slowdown in the effort to curb the viral spread, and the consequent mortality rates. We present a new procedure, the Purified by Unified Resampling of Infected Multitudes, in short Purim, able to untangle any massive candidate sample with inexpensive screening, through the cross-correlated analysis of the joint speciments. This procedure can reveal and detect most negative patients and in most cases discover the identity of the few positives already in the first or few secondary tests. We investigate the the two-dimensional correlation case in function of the infection probability. The multi-dimensional topology, the scaled Purim procedure are also considered. Extensive Purim tests may measure and weight the degree of epidemic: their outcome may identify focal regions in the early stages. Assuming hundreds or thousand subjects, the saving both in time and in cost will be remarkable. Purim may be able to filter scheduled flights, scholar acceptance, popular international event participants. The optimal extension of Purim outcome is growing as the inverse of the epidemia expansion. Therefore, the earlier, the better.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fargion, Benjamin Isac; Fargion, Daniele; Lucentini, Pier Giorgio De Sanctis; Habib, Emanuele","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54dad9350708facd9351fde49824cbcf3593e4ac.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11975v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["short Purim","scaled Purim procedure","Extensive Purim tests","optimal extension of Purim outcome","inexpensive screening","mass screening","cost of testing","new procedure","negative cases","cost of precious time","subjects","positive individuals","negative patients","secondary tests","flow of productive population","scholar acceptance","Unified Resampling of Infected Multitudes","method","health risks","scheduled flights","popular international event participants","common PCR","polymerase chain reaction","massive candidate sample","function","cross-correlated analysis","multi-dimensional topology","viral spread","broad slowdown","focal regions","two-dimensional correlation case","effort","inverse","saving","consequent mortality rates","infection probability","joint speciments","available resources","early stages","pandemic","selection","degree of epidemic","current rate","exclusion","rapid defeat","cleaning","epidemia expansion","identity","hundreds","positives","CoVid","world"],"language":"en"},

While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We provide timely short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative case data for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7,409-7,496 additional cases in Hubei and 1,128-1,929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 - 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588 - 13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th - 9th). Our forecasts suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roosa, K.; Lee, Y.; Luo, R.; Kirpich, A.; Rothenberg, R.; Hyman, J.

We focus here on vacation trips (for all transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations, creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective control strategies at a national level.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ye, Jiachen; Hu, Qitong; Ji, Peng; Barthelemy, Marc","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc2b86e7dfe23b8ae844e694d3bf3c11c50fc110.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07276v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread","travel restrictions","travel flows","spatial distribution","interurban movements","travel bans","small set of cities","national distribution of populations","initial distribution","different cities","epidemic modeling","results","Chinese Lunar New Year","strong population concentration","crucial ingredient","high concentration","fundamental ingredient","spatial fluctuations","national level","large temporal","large scale","larger number of origins","effective control strategies","transportation modes","transport planning","intra-city","destinations","counter-effect","individual contacts","vacation trips","hubs","pendular ratio","novel coronavirus","COVID","week","ones","diseases","light","return","dynamics"],"language":"en"},

(Q4) What is the ratio of the population that needs to be infected to achieve herd immunity? (Q5) How effective are the social distancing approaches? (Q6) What is the ratio of the population infected in the long run? For (Q1) and (Q2), we propose a time-dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that tracks 2 time series: (i) the transmission rate at time t and (ii) the recovering rate at time t. Such an approach is more adaptive than traditional static SIR models and more robust than direct estimation methods. Using the data provided by China, we show that the one-day prediction errors for the numbers of confirmed cases are almost in 3%, and the total number of confirmed cases is precisely predicted. Also, the turning point, defined as the day that the transmission rate is less than the recovering rate can be accurately predicted. After that day, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is less than 1. For (Q3), we extend our SIR model by considering 2 types of infected persons: detectable and undetectable infected persons. Whether there is an outbreak in such a model is characterized by the spectral radius of a 2 by 2 matrix that is closely related to $R_0$. For (Q4), we show that herd immunity can be achieved after at least 1-1/$R_0$ fraction of individuals being infected. For (Q5) and (Q6), we analyze the independent cascade (IC) model for disease propagation in a configuration random graph.

However, in practice, recognition is essentially an open set problem. There are categories we know called\u0022knowns\u0022, and there are more we do not know called\u0022unknowns\u0022. Enumerating all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently it is infeasible to prepare sufficient training samples for those unknowns. Applying closed set recognition methods will naturally lead to unseen-category errors. To address this problem, we propose the prototype based Open Deep Network (P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype learning into open set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are trained jointly to guide a CNN network to derive more discriminative features. Then P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method based on the distance metric between features and prototypes. Manual labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process as new categories. Predictors for new categories are added to the classification layer to\u0022open\u0022the deep neural networks to incorporate new categories dynamically. The weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying a distances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this initialization method speed up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples needed to train new predictors. Extensive experiments show that P-ODN can effectively detect unknowns and needs only few samples with human intervention to recognize a new category. In the real world scenarios, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UCF11, UCF50, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.","publish_time":"2019-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shu, Yu; Shi, Yemin; Wang, Yaowei; Huang, Tiejun; Tian, Yonghong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a331c08cf6286d7a95a9837c3d9b8586b7f8e9ff.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01851v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Open Deep Network","CNN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new categories","unknowns","open set recognition tasks","open set problem","new category","weights of new predictors","closed set recognition methods","Open Deep Network","P-ODN","closed set scenarios","existing recognition algorithms","initialization method","prototype learning","prototype radiuses","Prototypes","sufficient training samples","CNN network","fine-tuning process","previous process","discriminative features","multi-class triplet thresholding method","deep neural networks","real world scenarios","unseen-category errors","UCF50","UCF11","state-of-the-art performance","distance metric","UCF101","human intervention","classification layer","HMDB51 datasets","Extensive experiments","learned knowledge","distances","practice","Manual"],"language":"en"},

However, these epidemiological models predominantly based on training data employing number of cases and fatalities are limited in that they do not account for the spatiotemporal population dynamics that principally contributes to the disease spread. Here, a stochastic cellular automata enabled predictive model is presented that is able to accurate describe the effect of demography-dependent population dynamics on disease transmission. Using the spread of coronavirus in the state of New York as a case study, results from the computational framework remarkably agree with the actual count for infected cases and deaths as reported across organizations. The predictions suggest that an extended lockdown in some form, for up to 180 days, can significantly reduce the risk of a second wave of the outbreak. In addition, increased availability of medical testing is able to reduce the number of infected patients, even when less stringent social distancing guidelines and imposed. Equipping this stochastic approach with demographic factors such as age ratio, pre-existing health conditions, robustifies the model to predict the transmittivity of future outbreaks before they transform into an epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munshi, Joydeep; Roy, Indranil; Balasubramanian, Ganesh","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01001v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["infected cases","number of cases","disease transmission","spread of coronavirus","disease spread","dependent population dynamics","number of infected patients","spatiotemporal population dynamics","imposed lockdown measures","predictive model","training data","stochastic approach","rapid transmission","extended lockdown","data-guided approaches","contagious novel coronavirus","stochastic cellular automata","age ratio","pre-existing health conditions","case study","robustifies","effect of demography","demographic factors","actual count","state of New York","increased availability of medical testing","computational framework","results","targeted geographies","deaths","addition","control","stringent social distancing guidelines","transmittivity of future outbreaks","attempt","form","pandemic","epidemiological models","fatalities","wave","risk","days","predictions","organizations","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

However, if we had data from other on-going clinical trials and volunteers, we may do much more. For example, for confirmed stay-at-home COVID-19 patients, a longitudinal audio test could be developed to determine contact-with-hospital recommendations, and for the most critical COVID-19 patients a success ratio forecast test, including patient clinical data, to prioritize ICU allocation. As a challenge to the engineering community and in the context of our clinical trial, the authors suggest distributing cough recordings daily, hoping other trials and crowdsourcing users will contribute more data.

In Italy, the devised forecasts have been mostly based on a pure data-driven approach, by fitting and extrapolating open data on the epidemic evolution collected by the Italian Civil Protection Center. In this respect, SIR epidemiological models, which start from the description of the nonlinear interactions between population compartments, would be a much more desirable approach to understand and predict the collective emergent response. The present contribution addresses the fundamental question whether a SIR epidemiological model, suitably enriched with asymptomatic and dead individual compartments, could be able to provide reliable predictions on the epidemic evolution. To this aim, a machine learning approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to automatically identify the model parameters based on a training set of data of progressive increasing size, considering Lombardy in Italy as a case study. The analysis of the scatter in the forecasts shows that model predictions are quite sensitive to the size of the dataset used for training, and that further data are still required to achieve convergent -- and therefore reliable -- predictions.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paggi, Marco","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c974dd20a3c952364d928115c33cd0dd4fdbbef.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08207v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Civil Protection Center"],"locations":["Lombardy"],"keyphrases":["epidemic evolution","model predictions","open data","reliable predictions","training set of data","pure data-driven approach","model parameters","SIR epidemiological models","desirable approach","Italy","machine learning approach","population compartments","Computational models","devised forecasts","progressive increasing size","dead individual compartments","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","simulation","Lombardy","fundamental question","particle swarm optimization","SARS-CoV","impact","lockdown measures","fitting","healthcare policies","Italian Civil Protection Center","authorities","nonlinear interactions","description","public health","economy","present contribution","PSO","case study","aim","dataset","scatter","respect","collective emergent response","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Despite crisis such as natural disasters can be predicted by professional institutions, certain events are first signaled by civilians, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemics. Social media platforms such as Twitter often exposes firsthand signals on such crises through high volume information exchange over half a billion tweets posted daily. Prior works proposed various crisis embeddings and classification using conventional Machine Learning and Neural Network models. However, none of the works perform crisis embedding and classification using state of the art attention-based deep neural networks models, such as Transformers and document-level contextual embeddings. This work proposes CrisisBERT, an end-to-end transformer-based model for two crisis classification tasks, namely crisis detection and crisis recognition, which shows promising results across accuracy and f1 scores. The proposed model also demonstrates superior robustness over benchmark, as it shows marginal performance compromise while extending from 6 to 36 events with only 51.4% additional data points. We also proposed Crisis2Vec, an attention-based, document-level contextual embedding architecture for crisis embedding, which achieve better performance than conventional crisis embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GloVe.

In other words, meteorological conditions tend to impact the activity of viruses, and this information can be exploited for the operational management of hospitals. In this study, we use three years of daily data from one of the biggest hospitals in Switzerland and focus on modelling the extremes of hospital visits from patients showing flu-like symptoms and the number of positive cases of flu. We propose employing a discrete Generalized Pareto distribution for the number of positive and negative cases, and a Generalized Pareto distribution for the odds of positive cases. Our modelling framework allows for the parameters of these distributions to be linked to covariate effects, and for outlying observations to be dealt with via a robust estimation approach. Because meteorological conditions may vary over time, we use meteorological and not calendar variations to explain hospital charge extremes, and our empirical findings highlight their significance. We propose a measure of hospital congestion and a related tool to estimate the resulting CaRe (Charge-at-Risk-estimation) under different meteorological conditions. The relevant numerical computations can be easily carried out using the freely available GJRM R package. The introduced approach could be applied to several types of seasonal disease data such as those derived from the new virus SARS-CoV-2 and its COVID-19 disease which is at the moment wreaking havoc worldwide. The empirical effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed through a simulation study.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ranjbar, Setareh; Cantoni, Eva; Chavez-Demoulin, Val\u0027erie; Marra, Giampiero; Radice, Rosalba; Jaton-Ogay, Katia","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e2cd0b42dec19f72031adbf7fc70aab2bea0141.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05808v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["number of positive cases of flu","different meteorological conditions","seasonal viruses","odds of positive cases","hospital charge extremes","negative cases","extremes of hospital visits","activity of viruses","discrete Generalized Pareto distribution","types of seasonal disease data","measure of hospital congestion","robust estimation approach","empirical findings","Risk-estimation","empirical effectiveness","biggest hospitals","simulation study","introduced approach","modelling framework","years of daily data","operational management of hospitals","related tool","patients","symptoms","resulting CaRe","proposed method","covariate effects","milder coronavirus colds","variations","new virus SARS-CoV","available GJRM R package","outlying observations","distributions","parameters","information","Switzerland","time","relevant numerical computations","moment","COVID","significance","words","warmer months","havoc"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, identifying media framing is a crucial step to understanding how news media influence the public. Framing is, however, difficult to operationalize and detect, and thus traditional media framing studies had to rely on manual annotation, which is challenging to scale up to massive news datasets. Here, by developing a media frame classifier that achieves state-of-the-art performance, we systematically analyze the media frames of 1.5 million New York Times articles published from 2000 to 2017. By examining the ebb and flow of media frames over almost two decades, we show that short-term frame abundance fluctuation closely corresponds to major events, while there also exist several long-term trends, such as the gradually increasing prevalence of the \u0060\u0060Cultural identity\u0027\u0027 frame.

To study this, we choose economic production networks as a paradigm. An economic network can be examined at many levels: linkages among individual agents (microscopic), among firms/sectors (mesoscopic) or among countries (macroscopic). New emergent dynamical properties appear at every level, so the granularity matters. For viral epidemics, even an individual node may act as an epicenter of distress and potentially affect the entire network. Economic networks, however, are known to be immune at the micro-levels and more prone to failure in the meso/macro-levels. We propose a dynamical interaction model to characterize the mechanism of distress propagation, across different modules of a network, initiated at different epicenters. Vulnerable modules often lead to large degrees of destabilization. We demonstrate our methodology using a unique empirical data-set of input-output linkages across 0.14 million firms in one administrative state of India, a developing economy. The network has multiple hub-and-spoke structures that exhibits moderate disassortativity, which varies with the level of coarse-graining. The novelty lies in characterizing the production network at different levels of granularity or modularity, and finding \u0060too-big-to-fail\u0027 modules supersede \u0060too-central-to-fail\u0027 modules in distress propagation.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Ashish; Chakrabarti, Anindya S.; Chakraborti, Anirban; Nandi, Tushar","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d8193a8f453d3260e1cc3c6db4cee693ffea320.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14485v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["different modules","network topology","entire network","different levels of granularity","Economic networks","mechanism of distress propagation","economic production networks","micro-levels","macro-levels","epicenter of distress","Vulnerable modules","firms","connected networks","different epicenters","individual agents","individual node","level of coarse","granularity matters","input-output linkages","dynamical interaction model","New emergent dynamical properties","failure","extent","administrative state of India","unique empirical data","structures","sectors","meso","developing economy","large degrees of destabilization","countries","methodology","viral epidemics","multiple hub","paradigm","modularity","moderate disassortativity","graining","novelty"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we characterized an EBOV-glycoprotein (GP) pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system in different cell cultures, including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human macrophages, for the screening of anti-EBOV-GP agent(s). Based on this system, we demonstrated that an aqueous extract (CHPV) from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris displayed a potent inhibitory effect on EBOV-GP pseudotyped virus (EBOV-GP-V)-mediated infection in various cell lines, including HUVEC and macrophage. In addition, our results indicated that CHPV was able to block an eGFP-expressing Zaire ebola virus (eGFP-ZEBOV) infection in VeroE6 cells. The anti-EBOV activity of CHPV was exhibited in a dose-dependent manner. At a 12.5 \u03BCg/ml concentration, the CHPV showed a greater than 80% inhibition of EBOV-GP-V and eGFP-EBOV infections. Likewise, our studies suggested that the inhibitory effect of CHPV occurred by binding directly to EBOV-GP-Vs and blocking the early viral events. Interestingly, our results have shown that CHPV was able to enhance the anti-EBOV activity of the monoclonal antibody MAb 2G4 against EBOV-GP. Overall, this study provides evidence that CHPV has anti-EBOV activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach against EBOV infection.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xu; Ao, Zhujun; Bello, Alexander; Ran, Xiaozhuo; Liu, Shuiping; Wigle, Jeffrey; Kobinger, Gary; Yao, Xiaojian","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f247d115151ee3e9c99f5ddf7e30d4b0063ef236.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113790.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216300031; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.01.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216300031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26778707/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHPV","EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibition of EBOV","EBOV-glycoprotein","anti-EBOV activity of CHPV","EBOV-GP pseudotyped virus","eGFP-EBOV infections","screening of anti-EBOV-GP agent","GP-V","inhibitory effect of CHPV","mediated infection","prevention of Ebola virus","eGFP-ZEBOV","Zaire ebola virus","results","study","potent inhibitory effect","based vector system","pseudotyped HIV","human macrophages","VeroE6 cells","human umbilical vein endothelial cells","different cell cultures","various cell lines","novel antiviral approach","HUVECs","treatment","monoclonal antibody MAb 2G4","Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris","Vs","evidence","binding","early viral events","concentration","aqueous extract","dose-dependent manner","studies","\u03BCg","addition"],"language":"en"},

Viral infections predispose patients to secondary bacterial infections, which often have a more severe clinical course. The mechanisms underlying post-viral bacterial infections are complex, and include multifactorial processes mediated by interactions between viruses, bacteria, and the host immune system. Studies over the past 15 years have demonstrated that unique microbial communities reside on the mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory tract, which have both direct and indirect effects on host defense against viral infections. In addition, antiviral immune responses induced by acute respiratory infections such as influenza are associated with changes in microbial composition and function (\u201Cdysbiosis\u201D) in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, which in turn may alter subsequent immune function against secondary bacterial infection or alter the dynamics of inter-microbial interactions, thereby enhancing the proliferation of potentially pathogenic bacterial species. In this review, we summarize the literature on the interactions between host microbial communities and host defense, and how influenza, and other acute respiratory viral infections disrupt these interactions, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of secondary bacterial infections.","publish_time":"2018-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanada, Shigeo; Pirzadeh, Mina; Carver, Kyle Y.; Deng, Jane C.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c97d3d01a4d77e5f4f458ed46ba5399f3647a74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6250824.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30505304/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02640","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute respiratory infections","acute respiratory viral infections","post-viral bacterial infections","respiratory tract","pathogenesis of secondary bacterial infections","host microbial communities","host defense","Influenza","host immune system","common type of acute respiratory infection","microbial composition","dynamics of inter-microbial interactions","gastrointestinal tract","unique microbial communities","pathogenic bacterial species","subsequent immune function","antiviral immune responses","mucosal surfaces","indirect effects","years","viruses","turn","proliferation","patients","multifactorial processes","changes","dysbiosis","literature","mechanisms","addition","severe clinical course","Studies","review"],"language":"en"},

In addition, weak activation of Akt cannot prevent SARS-CoV infection-induced apoptosis in Vero E6 cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, which is constitutively phosphorylated at tyrosine (Tyr)-705 and slightly phosphorylated at serine (Ser)-727 in Vero E6 cells, was dephosphorylated at Tyr-705 on SARS-CoV infection. In addition to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in virus-infected cells, other MAPKs, i.e., extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), were phosphorylated. Although inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK (PD98059 and SP600125) had no effect on phosphorylation status of STAT3, inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580 and SB202190) partially inhibited dephosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr-705. Tyr-705-phosphorylated STAT3 was localized mainly in the nucleus in mock infected cells, whereas STAT3 disappeared from the nucleus in virus-infected cells. As STAT3 acts as an activator of transcription in the nucleus, these results suggest that STAT3 lacks its activity on transcription in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells.","publish_time":"2004-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizutani, Tetsuya; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Murakami, Masaaki; Hirano, Toshio; Saijo, Masayuki; Kurane, Ichiro; Morikawa, Shigeru","journal":"FEBS Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1518846a9150fc86e5fb2aec92a4015e3268035.json; document_parses/pdf_json/da0342ac2f74af964ce1a72731bfec7d7d0a483e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125663.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579304012256; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579304012256","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","MAPK"],"locations":["Vero"],"keyphrases":["infected Vero E6 cells","phosphorylated STAT3","virus-infected cells","mock infected cells","SARS coronavirus","STAT3 acts","SARS-CoV infection-induced apoptosis","activation of p38 MAPK","phosphorylation of p38 MAPK","inhibitors of p38 MAPK","cytopathic effects of SARS","phosphorylation status of STAT3","nucleus","inhibited dephosphorylation of STAT3","activator of transcription","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","JNK","addition","extracellular signal-regulated kinase","N-terminal kinase","signal transducer","inhibitors of ERK1","weak activation of Akt","SB203580","SB202190","MAPKs","activity","downstream targets","PD98059","SP600125","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","results","global public health emergency","present study","serine","tyrosine"],"language":"en"},

Because coronavirus spike glycoproteins (S) mediate virus entry, affect viral host range, and elicit neutralizing antibodies, analyzing the functions of MERS-CoV S protein is a high research priority. MERS-CoV S on lentivirus pseudovirions mediated entry into a variety of cell types including embryo cells from New World Eptesicus fuscus bats. Surprisingly, a polyclonal antibody to the S protein of MHV, a group a murine betacoronavirus, cross-reacted in immunoblots with the S2 domain of group c MERS-CoV spike protein. MERS pseudovirions released from 293T cells contained only uncleaved S, and pseudovirus entry was blocked by lysosomotropic reagents NH(4)Cl and bafilomycin and inhibitors of cathepsin L. However, when MERS pseudovirions with uncleaved S protein were adsorbed at 4\u00B0C to Vero E6 cells, brief trypsin treatment at neutral pH triggered virus entry at the plasma membrane and syncytia formation. When 293T cells producing MERS pseudotypes co-expressed serine proteases TMPRSS-2 or -4, large syncytia formed at neutral pH, and the pseudovirions produced were non-infectious and deficient in S protein. These experiments show that if S protein on MERS pseudovirions is uncleaved, then viruses enter by endocytosis in a cathepsin L-dependent manner, but if MERS-CoV S is cleaved, either during virus maturation by serine proteases or on pseudovirions by trypsin in extracellular fluids, then viruses enter at the plasma membrane at neutral pH and cause massive syncytia formation even in cells that express little or no MERS-CoV receptor. Thus, whether MERS-CoV enters cells within endosomes or at the plasma membrane depends upon the host cell type and tissue, and is determined by the location of host proteases that cleave the viral spike glycoprotein and activate membrane fusion.","publish_time":"2013-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Zhaohui; Dominguez, Samuel R.; Holmes, Kathryn V.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c533a06c3dc5afefab5dd138ec4de394b537261.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3789674.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098509/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0076469","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","Vero"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS pseudovirions","CoV S protein","MERS-CoV receptor","functions of MERS","uncleaved S protein","S protein of MHV","S2 domain of group c MERS-CoV spike protein","T cells","embryo cells","plasma membrane","lentivirus pseudovirions mediated entry","neutral pH","MERS pseudotypes co-expressed serine proteases TMPRSS","Vero E6 cells","pseudovirus entry","membrane fusion","location of host proteases","emerging human group c betacoronavirus","virus maturation","viral host range","host cell type","viral spike glycoprotein","coronavirus spike glycoproteins","viruses","massive syncytia formation","large syncytia","murine betacoronavirus","inhibitors of cathepsin","brief trypsin treatment","variety of cell types","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","New World Eptesicus fuscus bats","neutralizing antibodies","endosomes","high research priority","lysosomotropic reagents NH","biology","extracellular fluids","dependent manner","polyclonal antibody","bafilomycin","endocytosis","tissue","experiments"],"language":"en"},

Effective implementation of Health Promoting School is a complex intervention involving multi-factorial and innovative activity in many domains such as curriculum, school environment and community. Many studies evaluating Health Promoting School do not include outcomes reflecting the organisational or structural change as many of those studies are quantitative in nature and the statistical assumptions are not valid reflecting the organisational structure changes. Recent global meetings of experts have reviewed the impact on student health from the perspectives of school environment, school policies on health, action competencies on healthy living and community linkage. The English Wessex Healthy School Award Scheme and the Hong Kong Healthy School Awards Scheme have developed detailed systems to analyse whether each individual school has reached the standard of a model Health Promoting School reflecting a more holistic appreciation and understanding of all the effects of school-based health promotion with positive award-related changes. However, not many schools are able to implement Health Promoting School in its entirety, so cores indicators are needed as a starting point for wider implementation. Hong Kong Healthy School Awards Scheme is still ongoing with data for analysis of indicators with significant correlation with better health and well-being. We identified the core indicators and substantiated the requirements for successful outcomes by supplementing the established award-scheme framework with a review of recent literature and documents.

One vital device is an appropriate syringe for delivering vaccine. With the potential for millions to be infected and the vaccine supply severely stretched it is imperative that the syringe used to vaccinate waste as little vaccine as possible and thus allow for a maximum number of persons to be vaccinated. Our study tested seven leading candidate vaccine syringes for dosing accuracy, dose-capacity per vial, medication wastage and a battery of ergonomic features. One device, the Flu\u002B\u2122 syringe, proved superior to the others in all important categories, possibly due to its low dead-space volume and its dosing accuracy. The data suggest that switching to this device from any of the others tested would provide between 2 and 19% additional vaccine doses per vial if the current 10-dose vials are used. Extrapolations from this data suggest that many thousands to millions of additional persons could be vaccinated in mass campaigns. Use of a syringe of this type, and the vaccine savings that would accrue, would likely be important in reducing morbidity and mortality in the event of a pandemic of influenza.","publish_time":"2006-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Strauss, Kenneth; van Zundert, Andr\u00E9; Frid, Anders; Costigliola, Vincenzo","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c64363f606997414a68bb7d808442d596f2ace19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115405.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X06002490; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X06002490","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["little vaccine","vaccine supply","vaccine savings","additional vaccine doses","appropriate syringe","leading candidate vaccine syringes","dosing accuracy","millions of additional persons","vital device","data","global pandemic of influenza","dose-capacity","dose vials","appropriate drugs","important categories","maximum number of persons","medication wastage","low dead-space volume","unprecedented threat","battery of ergonomic features","mortality","event","study","thousands","waste","face","morbidity","type","mass campaigns","devices","potential","Abstract","Extrapolations"],"language":"en"},

The clinical presentation of MERS-CoV infection ranges from asymptomatic to very severe disease, and the classical presentation includes fever, cough chills, sore throat, myalgia, and arthralgia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 339 healthcare personnel was conducted over an 8-month period in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia using a structured survey that included demographic information and questions testing participant\u2019s knowledge. RESULTS: Approximately two-thirds of the respondents properly identified the causative agent of MERS-CoV as an RNA virus (66.4%, n = 225) that is enveloped (68.1%, n = 231). On the other hand, few respondents identified the proper number of strains or the genus (16.5% and 17.4%, respectively). More than half of the study sample identified the disease as zoonotic (57.2%, n = 194). Similarly, 89.1% (n = 302) identified that camels and bats are prone to infection with coronaviruses. Only 23.9% (n = 81) properly identified March through May as the season with the highest transmission rate. There was a massive lack of adequate knowledge regarding prevalence of antibodies. Only 18.3% (n = 62) of respondents identified PCR as the proper diagnostic confirmatory test for MERS-CoV infection. Regarding MERS-CoV clinical features, 76.4% (n = 259) recognized the presence of sub-clinical infection, 64.7% (n = 218) indicated that cases should be immediately isolated, and 46.9% (n = 159) identified the main cause of mortality as respiratory failure.

The current method of detection involves a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\u2013based technique, which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity. False-negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission. We aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to diagnose COVID-19. METHODS: The host humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, including IgA, IgM, and IgG response, was examined by using an ELISA-based assay on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein. 208 plasma samples were collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases (qPCR negative but with typical manifestation). The diagnostic value of IgM was evaluated in this cohort. RESULTS: The median duration of IgM and IgA antibody detection was 5 (IQR, 3\u20136) days, while IgG was detected 14 (IQR, 10\u201318) days after symptom onset, with a positive rate of 85.4%, 92.7%, and 77.9%, respectively. In confirmed and probable cases, the positive rates of IgM antibodies were 75.6% and 93.1%, respectively. The detection efficiency by IgM ELISA is higher than that of qPCR after 5.5 days of symptom onset. The positive detection rate is significantly increased (98.6%) when combining IgM ELISA assay with PCR for each patient compared with a single qPCR test (51.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, including subclinical cases.","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Li; Ren, Lili; Yang, Siyuan; Xiao, Meng; Chang, De; Yang, Fan; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Wang, Yingying; Wu, Chao; Xiao, Yan; Zhang, Lulu; Han, Lianlian; Dang, Shengyuan; Xu, Yan; Yang, Qi-Wen; Xu, Sheng-Yong; Zhu, Hua-Dong; Xu, Ying-Chun; Jin, Qi; Sharma, Lokesh; Wang, Linghang; Wang, Jianwei","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/702a054b29bc68d6e1e5db1ef5992c81fb4cd966.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184472.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32198501/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa310","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IgM ELISA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IgM ELISA assay","qPCR negative","positive rates of IgM antibodies","SARS-CoV","positive detection rate","IgA antibody detection","median duration of IgM","diagnostic value of IgM","detection efficiency","IgG response","probable cases","ELISA-based assay","days of symptom onset","viral transmission","host humoral response","single qPCR test","current method of detection","subclinical cases","IQR","diagnosis of COVID","viral nucleic acids","False-negative results","based technique","recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein","infected patient","major setback","novel coronavirus","emergence of coronavirus disease","potential of antibody testing","major healthcare threat","time kinetics of various antibodies","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","present","sufficient quantity","failure","typical manifestation","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","plasma samples","cohort"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, it has been a priority of many pathogens to manipulate the cellular NF-\u03BAB activity in order to create a favorable environment for their survival inside the host. RESULTS: We observed that heterologous expression of the open reading frame 2 (ORF2) protein in human hepatoma cells led to stabilization of the cellular I kappa B alpha (I\u03BAB\u03B1) pool, with a concomitant reduction in the nuclear localization of the p65 subunit of NF-\u03BAB and inhibition of NF-\u03BAB activity. Although basal or TPA induced phosphorylation of I\u03BAB\u03B1 was not altered, its ubiquitination was markedly reduced in ORF2 expressing cells. Further analysis revealed that ORF2 protein could directly associate with the F-box protein, beta transducin repeat containing protein (\u03B2TRCP) and ORF2 over expression resulted in reduced association of I\u03BAB\u03B1 with the SKP1 and CUL1 components of the SCF(\u03B2TRCP) complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay of the proximal promoter regions of MHC-I heavy chain and IL-8 genes using p65 antibody and LPS stimulated ORF2 expressing cell extract revealed decreased association of p65 with the above regions, indicating that ORF2 inhibited p65 binding at endogenous promoters.

The structures showed two ligand-recognition modes in the TIM family. The mTIM-1 structure identified a homophilic TIM-TIM adhesion interaction, whereas the mTIM-2 domain formed a dimer that prevented homophilic binding.

This evolution was thought to occur by independent generation of DI RNAs during virus passages and subsequent selection of new DI RNAs under new cellular conditions. Here we demonstrate that recombination between the old DI RNA and the helper viral RNA can be one of the mechanisms for natural DI RNA evolution. A mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) DI RNA, DIssE RNA, was transcribed in vitro and transfected into a mouse cell line infected with a different MHV strain (A59), which is distinguishable from the original natural helper MHV (JHM). During subsequent serial undiluted passages of the harvested virus, several novel DI RNA species were generated, while the original DIssE RNA disappeared by passage 11. cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of one of these novel DI RNAs, designated DI-2, revealed that it is composed of four discontinuous regions of the genomic sequence and is different from the structure of the original DIssE RNA. Sequence comparison among DI-2, DIssE, and helper MHV-A59 RNAs showed that DI-2 sequence is similar to DIssE in the first and second regions, but similar to the helper A59 virus in the third and last regions. Thus, this DI RNA was generated by RNA recombination between the original DIssE RNA and the herper viral RNA. These results indicate that recombination between DI RNA and helper virus RNA can be involved in the natural evolution of DI RNAs.","publish_time":"1993-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Furuya, Tetsuya; Macnaughton, Thomas B.; La Monica, Nicola; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682283712778; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682283712778","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DI RNA","DI RNAs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["old DI RNA","RNA recombination","natural DI RNA evolution","helper virus RNA","original DIssE RNA","novel DI RNA species","RNAs of RNA viruses","designated DI","novel DI RNAs","helper viral RNA","natural evolution of DI RNAs","herper viral RNA","independent generation of DI RNAs","subsequent selection of new DI RNAs","helper MHV-A59 RNAs","helper A59 virus","virus passages","original natural helper MHV","harvested virus","mouse hepatitis virus","sequence analysis","genomic sequence","Sequence comparison","different MHV strain","subsequent serial undiluted passages","serial undiluted passages of viruses","discontinuous regions","new cellular conditions","mouse cell line","structure","mechanisms","size","Abstract Defective-interfering","JHM","cDNA cloning","results"],"language":"en"},

Full\u2010length spike, hemagglutinin/esterase (HE), nucleocapsid and transmembrane genes were simultaneously cloned from 13 clinical samples (eight farms in four provinces), and most of the BCoV strains showed a unique evolutionary pattern based on the phylogenetic analysis of these genes. Interesting, 10 of the 13 strains were identified as HE recombinant strains, and these strains had experienced the same recombination event and carried the same recombination sites located between the esterase and lectin domain. They also shared an identical aa variant (F181V) in the R2\u2010loop. Moreover, 9/10 strains displayed another identical aa variant (P, S158A) in the adjacent R1\u2010loop of the HE gene, which differs from the other available BCoV HE sequences in the GenBank database. Our results showed that BCoV is widely circulating in dairy cattle in China, contributing to the diagnosis and control of dairy calves diarrhoea. Furthermore, a BCoV strain that carries a recombinant HE gene has spread in dairy calves in China. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of an HE recombination event occurring in BCoV; this is also the first description of the molecular prevalence of BCoV in China. Our findings will enhance current understanding about the genetic evolution of BCoV.","publish_time":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"keha, Abi; Xue, Luo; Yan, Shen; Yue, Hua; Tang, Cheng","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db221b53146dd8ee59c108faf405be9b193046d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168545.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077561/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13228","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GenBank"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["BCoV strains","available BCoV","genetic evolution of BCoV","molecular prevalence of BCoV","dairy cattle","recombinant strains","control of dairy calves diarrhoea","China","newborn calves","recombination event","adult cattle","faecal samples","identical aa variant","esterase","clinical samples","recombination sites","farms","description","loop","causative agent of diarrhoea","Chinese provinces","transmembrane genes","winter dysentery","respiratory tract illnesses","S158A","unique evolutionary pattern","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","F181V","diagnosis","phylogenetic analysis","current understanding","adjacent R1","total","Full\u2010length spike","hemagglutinin","world","nucleocapsid","R2","lectin domain","GenBank database","Bovine coronavirus","findings","study","knowledge","best","results"],"language":"en"},

In developed countries KD is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in childhood. The aetiology of KD remains unknown, and it is currently believed that one or more as yet unidentified infectious agents induce an intense inflammatory host response in genetically susceptible individuals. Genetic studies have identified several susceptibility genes for KD and its sequelae in different ethnic populations, including FCGR2A, CD40, ITPKC, FAM167A-BLK and CASP3, as well as genes influencing response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aneurysm formation such as FCGR3B, and transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03B2 pathway genes. IVIG and aspirin are effective therapeutically, but recent clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that the addition of corticosteroids to IVIG is beneficial for the prevention of coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) in severe cases with highest risk of IVIG resistance. Outside of Japan, however, clinical scores to predict IVIG resistance perform suboptimally. Furthermore, the evidence base does not provide clear guidance on which corticosteroid regimen is most effective. Other therapies, including anti-TNF\u03B1, could also have a role for IVIG-resistant KD. Irrespective of these caveats, it is clear that therapy that reduces inflammation in acute KD, improves outcome. This paper summarises recent advances in the understanding of KD pathogenesis and therapeutics, and provides an approach for managing KD patients in the UK in the light of these advances.","publish_time":"2013-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eleftheriou, D; Levin, M; Shingadia, D; Tulloh, R; Klein, NJ; Brogan, PA","journal":"Arch Dis Child","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f7bc4da553becc28ba03a2ac4a98133d4689adc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3888612.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24162006/; https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2012-302841","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD","IVIG","UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute KD","IVIG-resistant KD","KD patients","aetiology of KD","understanding of KD pathogenesis","developed countries KD","highest risk of IVIG resistance","susceptibility genes","recent advances","coronary arteries","recent clinical trials","\u03B2 pathway genes","intense inflammatory host response","acute self-limiting inflammatory disorder","clear guidance","clinical scores","heart disease","Kawasaki disease","medium-sized arteries","prevention of coronary artery aneurysms","CAA","severe cases","commonest cause","CD40","FCGR2A","sequelae","growth factor","intravenous immunoglobulin","different ethnic populations","ITPKC","vasculitis","unidentified infectious agents","TGF","meta-analyses","therapy","inflammation","FAM167A-BLK","susceptible individuals","aneurysm formation","FCGR3B","CASP3","corticosteroid regimen","addition of corticosteroids","therapeutics","UK","role","evidence base","light","childhood","Genetic studies","paper","approach","outcome","aspirin","anti-TNF\u03B1","therapies","caveats"],"language":"en"},

Management of AOM requires a thorough clinical exam and updated knowledge of local patterns of microorganisms involved and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, knowing that the presence of these microorganisms in AOM transtimpanic exudate cultures may vary depending on geographical areas and vaccination. AOM can be treated either with inmediate antibiotic or with observation depending on patients and clinical characteristics. The most common microorganism causing AOM are Pneumococcus, Haemophilus Influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. S. pneumoniae has acquired resistance to penicillin in the last decade that cannot be extrapolated to Amoxicillin. Based on this data Amoxicillin is recommended as the first choice. For amoxicillin failure, cefalosporins or B lactamase can be prescribed. Patients that presents with recurrent AOM should be refered to otolaryngologist for further evaluation and treatment.","publish_time":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krause, Francisco J.","journal":"Revista M\u00E9dica Cl\u00EDnica Las Condes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49acfa013ef1ff0e0c4998da2621faf2ea36e948.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0716864016301274; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0716864016301274","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["and Moraxella","Management of AOM","of medical visit and antimicrobial","AOM can be treated either with","and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles","Patients that presents with recurrent AOM should be refered","can be prescribed","knowing that the presence of these microorganisms in AOM transtimpanic","antibiotic or with observation depending on patients and clinical characteristics","thorough clinical exam and updated knowledge of local patterns of microorganisms","Clinical diagnosis should be performed with pneumatic otoscopy","penicillin in the last decade that cannot be extrapolated","The most common microorganism causing AOM","otolaryngologist for further evaluation and treatment","may vary depending on geographical areas and vaccination","in children","Based on","For amoxicillin failure","otitis media aguda","tratamiento antibi\u00F3tico inmediato","recommended as the first choice","cefalosporins or","Haemophilus Influenzae","SUMMARY Acute otitis media","cuadro cl\u00EDnico","Pneumococcus","very frequent","patolog\u00EDa infecciosa","acquired resistance","evaluaci\u00F3n","especialidad","manejo","observaci\u00F3n estricta","neumootoscop\u00EDa","caracter\u00EDsticas","virus","Neumococo","OMA recurrente","o\u00EDdo medio","mayor estudio","tendencias respecto","cefalosporinas","forma excepcional clindamicina","acucioso examen f\u00EDsico","pneumoniae","quinolonas","ni\u00F1os","paciente","asociaciones","RESUMEN","regi\u00F3n geogr\u00E1fica","presencia de vacunaci\u00F3n","caso de fracaso","resistencia a antibi\u00F3ticos","aumento","uso","primera l\u00EDnea","movilidad timp\u00E1nica","lact\u00E1micos","g\u00E9rmenes","amoxicilina","diagn\u00F3stico","prevalencia"],"language":"es"},

The interest in anti-coronavirus drug development has been limited so far and effective methods to prevent or treat coronavirus infections in humans are still lacking. Urgent action is needed to fight this fatal coronavirus infection by reducing the number of infected people along with the infection contagiousness and severity. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several weeks ago, we observe in GHU PARIS Psychiatrie \u0026 Neurosciences (Sainte-Anne hospital, Paris, France) a lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe forms of COVID-19 infections in psychiatric patients (\u223C4 %) compared to health care professionals (\u223C14 %). Similar observations have been noted in other psychiatric units in France and abroad. Our hypothesis is that psychiatric patients could be protected from the severe form of COVID-19 by their psychotropic treatments. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a phenothiazine derivative widely used in clinical routine in the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses. This first antipsychotic medication has been discovered in 1952 by Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker at Sainte-Anne hospital. In addition to its antipsychotic effects, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a CPZ antiviral activity via the inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Recently, independent studies revealed that CPZ is an anti-MERS-CoV and an anti-SARS-CoV-1 drug. In comparison to other antiviral drugs, the main advantages of CPZ lie in its biodistribution: (i) preclinical and clinical studies have reported a high CPZ concentration in the lungs (20--200 times higher than in plasma), which is critical because of the respiratory tropism of SARS-CoV-2; (ii) CPZ is highly concentrated in saliva (20-60 times higher than in plasma) and could therefore reduce the contagiousness of COVID-19; (iii) CPZ can cross the blood-brain barrier and could therefore prevent the neurological forms of COVID-19. METHODS: In this context, we will test the hypothesis that CPZ could decrease the unfavorable evolution of COVID-19 infection in oxygen-requiring patients without the need for intensive care, but also reduce the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2. At this end, we designed a pilot, phase III, multicenter, single blind, randomized controlled therapeutic trial. Efficacy of CPZ will be assessed according to clinical, biological and radiological criteria. The main objective is to demonstrate a shorter Time To Response (TTR) to treatment in the CPZ \u002B standard-of-care (CPZ \u002B SOC) group, compared to the SOC group. Response to treatment is defined by a reduction of at least one level of severity on the WHO-Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI). The secondary objectives are to demonstrate in the CPZ \u002B SOC group, compared to the SOC group: A) superior clinical improvement; B) a greater decrease in the biological markers of viral attack by SARS-CoV-2 (PCR, viral load); C) a greater decrease in inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP and lymphopenia); D) a greater decrease in parenchymal involvement (chest CT) on the seventh day post-randomization; E) to define the optimal dosage of CPZ and its tolerance; F) to evaluate the biological parameters of response to treatment, in particular the involvement of inflammatory cytokines. Patient recruitment along with the main and secondary objectives are in line with WHO 2020 COVID-19 guidelines. CONCLUSION: This repositioning of CPZ as anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity offers an alternative and rapid strategy to alleviate the virus propagation and the infection severity and lethality. This CPZ repositioning strategy also avoids numerous developmental and experimental steps, can save precious time to rapidly establish an anti-COVID-19 therapy with well-known, limited and easy to manage side effects. Indeed, CPZ is an FDA-approved drug with an excellent tolerance profile, prescribed for around 70 years, in psychiatry but also in clinical routine in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, in advanced cancer and also to treat headaches in various neurological conditions. The broad spectrum of CPZ treatment - including antipsychotic, anxiolytic, antiemetic, antiviral, immunomodulatory effects along with inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and modulation of blood-brain barrier - is in line with the historical French commercial name for CPZ, i.e. LARGACTIL, chosen as a reference to its \u0027LARGe ACTion\u0027 properties. The discovery of those CPZ properties, as for many other molecules in psychiatry, is both the result of serendipity and careful clinical observations. Using this approach, the field of mental illness could provide innovative therapeutic approaches to fight SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plaze, Mario; Attali, David; Petit, Anne-C\u00E9cile; Blatzer, Michael; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Vinckier, Fabien; Cachia, Arnaud; Chr\u00E9tien, Fabrice; Gaillard, Rapha\u00EBl","journal":"Encephale","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387014/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jean Delay","Pierre Deniker"],"organizations":["GHU PARIS Psychiatrie \u0026 Neurosciences","CPZ","SOC","CPZ   SOC","LARGACTIL"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["repositioning of CPZ","Efficacy of CPZ","anti-COVID","CPZ antiviral activity","CPZ repositioning strategy","main advantages of CPZ","contagiousness of COVID","high CPZ concentration","optimal dosage of CPZ","anti-SARS-CoV","ongoing COVID","severe forms of COVID","anti-MERS-CoV","clinical studies","contagiousness of SARS","SOC group","neurological forms of COVID","severe form of COVID","unfavorable evolution of COVID","greater decrease","infection severity","infection contagiousness","clinical routine","psychiatric patients","anti-coronavirus drug development","superior clinical improvement","fatal coronavirus infection","treatment of acute","coronavirus infections","secondary objectives","respiratory tropism of SARS","biological parameters of response","Sainte-Anne hospital","inflammatory markers","biological markers of viral attack","France","main objective","intensive care","independent studies","level of severity","times higher","plasma","psychiatric units","hypothesis","antipsychotic effects","involvement of inflammatory cytokines","health care professionals","rapid strategy","parenchymal involvement","shorter Time","antiviral drugs","viral load","precious time","effective methods","antipsychotic medication","GHU PARIS Psychiatrie","single blind","Pierre Deniker","chest CT","Neurosciences","lower prevalence of symptomatic","randomized controlled therapeutic trial","experimental steps","inhibition of clathrin","virus propagation","lymphopenia","CRP","PCR","TTR","number of infected people","phenothiazine derivative","day post-randomization","phase","Jean Delay","tolerance","need","lungs","Ordinal Scale","therapy","saliva","oxygen","standard","pilot","mediated endocytosis","chronic psychoses","blood-brain barrier","total","pandemic","biodistribution","reduction","lethality","radiological criteria","Patient recruitment","cases","comparison","addition","context","humans","psychotropic treatments","weeks","Chlorpromazine","CONCLUSION","Urgent action","Similar observations","deaths","beginning","guidelines","CPZ properties","psychiatry","broad spectrum of CPZ treatment","careful clinical observations","innovative therapeutic approaches","antiviral","antipsychotic","anxiolytic","modulation of blood","immunomodulatory effects","field of mental illness","FDA-approved drug","headaches","line","antiemetic","excellent tolerance profile","fight SARS-CoV","brain barrier","result of serendipity","pregnancy","reference","various neurological conditions","advanced cancer","LARGe ACTion","nausea","LARGACTIL","years","molecules"],"language":"en"},

An estimated 390 million people are at risk for infection with DENV and there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics. We utilized RNA chromatography coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS) to identify host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that interact with DENV-2 RNA. We identified ERI3 (also PRNPIP and PINT1), a putative 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 RNA exonuclease, which preferentially associates with DENV-2 genomic RNA via interactions with dumbbell structures in the 3\u2032 UTR. ERI3 is required for accumulation of DENV-2 genomic RNA and production of infectious particles. Furthermore, the mosquito homologue of ERI3 is required for DENV-2 replication in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitos implying that the requirement for ERI3 is conserved in both DENV hosts. In human cells ERI3 localizes to the Golgi in uninfected cells, but relocalizes near sites of DENV-2 replication in infected cells. ERI3 is not required for maintaining DENV-2 RNA stability or translation of the viral polyprotein, but is required for viral RNA synthesis. Our results define a specific role for ERI3 and highlight the importance of Golgi proteins in DENV-2 replication.","publish_time":"2016-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ward, Alex Michael; Calvert, Meredith E.

SARS-CoV-2 has a wide tropism and detection of the virus has been described in multiple specimen types, including various respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy and sensitivity of a laboratory modified CDCbased SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 assay across a range of sample types. Study Design We compared the matrix effect on the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection by qRT-PCR in nasal swabs collected in viral transport medium (VTM), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), sputum, plasma, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), stool, VTM, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and Hanks\u0027 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Initial limits of detection (LoD) were subsequently narrowed to confirm an LoD for each specimen type and target gene. RESULTS: LoDs were established using a modified CDC-based laboratory developed test and ranged from a mean CT cut-off of 33.8-35.7 (10-20 copies/reaction) for the N1 gene target, and 34.0-36.2 (1-10 copies/reaction) for N2. Alternatives to VTM such as PBS and HBSS had comparable LoDs. The N2 gene target was found to be most sensitive in CSF. CONCLUSION: A modified CDC-based laboratory developed test is able to detect SARSCoV- 2 accurately with similar sensitivity across all sample types tested.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perchetti, Garrett A.; Nalla, Arun K.; Huang, Meei-Li; Zhu, Haiying; Wei, Yulun; Stensland, Larry; Loprieno, Michelle A.; Jerome, Keith R.; Greninger, Alexander L.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35b110d2a8debd34f8fed8239fd804086e8196f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219399.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301803?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405257/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301803","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hanks\u0027 Balanced Salt Solution","PBS","HBSS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VTM","CDCbased SARS-CoV","N2 gene target","target gene","analytical sensitivity of SARS","N1 gene target","modified CDC-based laboratory","PBS","test","stool","multiple specimen types","similar sensitivity","HBSS","range of sample types","N2 assay","CSF","reaction","copies","Initial limits of detection","cerebrospinal fluid","comparable LoDs","various respiratory secretions","cerebral spinal fluid","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","sputum","nasal swabs","viral transport medium","plasma","bronchoalveolar lavage","matrix effect","phosphate buffered saline","BACKGROUND","Hanks\u0027 Balanced Salt Solution","qRT-PCR","SARSCoV","wide tropism","Study Design","accuracy","CONCLUSION","mean CT cut-off","considerable disruption","world","Alternatives","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","deaths"],"language":"en"},

For example, cells of immune system express various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect danger via recognizing specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and mount a specific immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one of these PRRs expressed by various immune cells. However, they were first discovered in the Drosophila melanogaster (common fruit fly) as genes/proteins important in embryonic development and dorso-ventral body patterning/polarity. Till date, 13 different types of TLRs (TLR1-TLR13) have been discovered and described in mammals since the first discovery of TLR4 in humans in late 1997. This discovery of TLR4 in humans revolutionized the field of innate immunity and thus the immunology and host-pathogen interaction. Since then TLRs are found to be expressed on various immune cells and have been targeted for therapeutic drug development for various infectious and inflammatory diseases including cancer. Even, Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among various TLR genes have been identified among the different human population and their association with susceptibility/resistance to certain infections and other inflammatory diseases. Thus, in the present review the current and future importance of TLRs in immunity, their pattern of expression among various immune cells along with TLR based therapeutic approach is reviewed.","publish_time":"2018-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vijay, Kumar","journal":"Int Immunopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6483c05ba9e9eb6c58c06cb7190fca40c8844ff1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106078.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156757691830095X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29730580/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2018.03.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156757691830095X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Drosophila"],"organizations":["TLR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["various immune cells","various TLR genes","various pathogens present","cells of immune system express various pattern recognition receptors","specific immune response","humans","different types of TLRs","PRRs","diverse system","inflammatory diseases","future importance of TLRs","specific pathogen","discovery of TLR4","therapeutic drug development","host-pathogen interaction","embryonic development","pattern of expression","present review","therapeutic approach","field of innate immunity","different human population","proteins important","dorso-ventral body patterning","susceptibility","association","common fruit fly","SNPs","vicinity of environmental surroundings","multicellular organisms","certain infections","resistance","immunology","PAMPs","Drosophila melanogaster","polarity","achordates","molecular patterns","Single nucleotide polymorphisms","danger","evolution","cancer","example","TLR1-TLR13","mammals","Toll"],"language":"en"},

The objective of our study was to characterize inactivation of PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV in various feed ingredient matrices. Samples of complete feed, spray dried porcine plasma, meat meal, meat and bone meal, blood meal, corn, soybean meal, and corn dried distillers grains with solubles were weighed (5 g/sample) into scintillation vials and inoculated with 1 mL of PEDV, PDCoV, or TGEV. Samples were incubated at room temperature for up to 56 days. Aliquots were removed at various time points followed by preparing serial 10-fold dilutions and inoculating in cell cultures to determine the amount of surviving virus. Inactivation kinetics were determined using the Weibull model, which estimates a delta value indicating the time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. Delta values of various ingredients were compared and analyzed as to their nutrient composition. Soybean meal had the greatest delta value (7.50 days) for PEDV (P \u003C 0.06) as compared with all other ingredients. High delta values (P \u003C 0.001) were observed in soybean meal for PDCoV (42.04 days) and TGEV (42.00 days). There was a moderate correlation between moisture content and the delta value for PDCoV (r = 0.49, P = 0.01) and TGEV (r = 0.41, P = 0.02). There was also a moderate negative correlation between TGEV survival and ether extract content (r = -0.51, P = 0.01). In conclusion, these results indicate that the first log reduction of PDCoV and TGEV takes the greatest amount of time in soybean meal. In addition to this, moisture and ether content appear to be an important determinant of virus survival in feed ingredients.","publish_time":"2017-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trudeau, Michaela P.; Verma, Harsha; Sampedro, Fernando; Urriola, Pedro E.; Shurson, Gerald C.; Goyal, Sagar M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2142f50e9a7ace971bc142fe4067a52c91b7af28.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5443540.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28542235/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","PEDV","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["soybean meal","meat meal","TGEV survival","Porcine Delta Corona Virus","bone meal","blood meal","virus concentration","virus transmission","surviving virus","days","greatest delta value","feed ingredients","Delta values of various ingredients","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus","Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus","High delta values","log reduction of PDCoV","inactivation of PEDV","important determinant of virus survival","contaminated feed","ether content","moisture content","Samples of complete feed","various time points","various feed ingredient matrices","dried porcine plasma","ether extract content","time necessary","moderate correlation","moderate negative correlation","corn dried distillers grains","Inactivation kinetics","major threats","swine health","solubles","serial","role","fold dilutions","Weibull model","cell cultures","scintillation vials","results","study","room temperature","Aliquots","addition","nutrient composition","conclusion","objective"],"language":"en"},

Of particular interest is the real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT LAMP) assay, which is rapid and cost-effective and can be adopted at ill-equipped laboratories. Clinical symptoms were characterized by a triad of fever, rash, and severe rheumatic manifestations. RT LAMP identified 20 additional Chikungunya virus\u2014positive cases, compared with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Chikungunya virus was isolated from 20 randomly selected samples. Genotyping of the virus isolates revealed that the East Central South African genotype of Chikungunya virus was the etiologic agent of this epidemic. Molecular diagnosis is an important tool to identify such new vectorborne viral illnesses.","publish_time":"2008-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lakshmi, Vemu; Neeraja, Mamidi; Subbalaxmi, M. V.

While disease has not been reported for FFV infection, FeLV infection can cause anemia and immunosuppression (progressive infection). Co-infection with FFV/FeLV allows evaluation of the pathogenic potential and epidemiology of FFV infection in cats with FeLV pathology. Blood and buccal swab samples from 81 cats were collected in Rio de Janeiro. Plasma was serologically tested for FeLV. DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and buccal swabs was used to PCR detect FFV and FeLV. A qPCR was developed to detect and measure FFV proviral loads (pVLs) in cats. FeLV qPCR was performed using previous methods. The median log10 pVL of FFV mono-infected individuals was lower than found in FFV/FeLV co-infected cats in buccal swabs (p = 0.003). We found 78% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA in FFV mono-infected and FFV co-infected FeLV-progressive cats, while in FeLV-regressive cats (those without signs of disease) 22% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA (p = 0.004). Our results suggest that regressive FeLV infection may reduce FFV saliva transmission, the main mode of FV transmission. We did not find evidence of differences in pathogenicity in FFV mono- and -dually infected cats. In summary, we show that FVs may interact with FeLV within the same host. Our study supports the utility of cats naturally co-infected with retroviruses as a model to investigate the impact of FV on immunocompromised mammalian hosts.","publish_time":"2018-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cavalcante, Liliane T.

OBJECTIVES: This study estimates recovery delay intervals and identifies associated factors in a sample of Saudi Arabian patients admitted for suspected MERS\u2010CoV and diagnosed by rRT\u2010PCR assay. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted on 829 patients admitted between September 2012 and June 2016 and diagnosed by rRT\u2010PCR procedures to have MERS\u2010CoV and non\u2010MERS\u2010CoV infection in which 396 achieved recovery. Detailed medical charts were reviewed for each patient who achieved recovery. Time intervals in days were calculated from presentation to the initial rRT\u2010PCR diagnosis (diagnosis delay) and from the initial rRT\u2010PCR diagnosis to recovery (recovery delay). RESULTS: The median recovery delay in our sample was 5 days. According to the multivariate negative binomial model, elderly (age \u2265 65), MERS\u2010CoV infection, ICU admission, and abnormal radiology findings were associated with longer recovery delay (adjusted relative risk (aRR): 1.741, 2.138, 2.048, and 1.473, respectively). Camel contact and the presence of respiratory symptoms at presentation were associated with a shorter recovery delay (expedited recovery) (aRR: 0.267 and 0.537, respectively). Diagnosis delay is a positive predictor for recovery delay (r = .421; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The study evidence supports that longer recovery delay was seen in patients of older age, MERS\u2010CoV infection, ICU admission, and abnormal radiology findings. Shorter recovery delay was found in patients who had camel contact and respiratory symptoms at presentation. These findings may help us understand clinical decision making on directing hospital resources toward prompt screening, monitoring, and implementing clinical recovery and treatment strategies.","publish_time":"2018-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Anwar E.; Al\u2010Jahdali, Hamdan; Alaqeel, Mody; Siddiq, Salma S.; Alsaab, Hanan A.; Sakr, Ezzeldin A.; Alyahya, Hamed A.; Alandonisi, Munzir M.; Subedar, Alaa T.; Ali, Yosra Z.; Al Otaibi, Hazza; Aloudah, Nouf M.; Baharoon, Salim; Al Johani, Sameera; Alghamdi, Mohammed G.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32ffbe671caf791831bb7516b550b4b27240a5f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6086845.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29624866/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12560","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["longer recovery delay","shorter recovery delay","median recovery delay","clinical recovery","achieved recovery","diagnosis delay","expedited recovery","study estimates recovery delay intervals","CoV infection","PCR diagnosis","suspected MERS","non\u2010MERS","initial rRT","presentation","patients of older age","study evidence","PCR procedures","PCR assay","abnormal radiology findings","sample of Saudi Arabian patients","ICU admission","presence of respiratory symptoms","Camel contact","associated factors","aRR","days","multicenter retrospective study","Research evidence","clinical decision","Time intervals","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","poor prognosis","hospital resources","monitoring","positive predictor","elderly","multivariate negative binomial model","relative risk","prompt screening","OBJECTIVES","BACKGROUND","METHODS","treatment strategies","RESULTS","Detailed medical charts","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Medical virology has a relatively brief history, spanning just over a century, but it is crowded with intriguing discoveries, stories of immense personal courage and numerous practical applications, many of which have had an overwhelmingly positive benefit on humankind. Its origins involved the replacement of centuries-old beliefs and theories with discoveries borne out of rigorous scientific investigation. Targeted prevention and control strategies could only be developed and implemented once the concept of the specificity of disease causation had been accepted, namely that infectious diseases are caused not by some common miasma (a mysteriously poisonous substance), but rather by specific agents. In a wider sense, the microbial sciences have played a pivotal role in the development of medical thought, particularly in applying scientific rigor in understanding pathological processes. Advances in understanding of infectious agents have led to improvements in human health and well-being that arguably have exceeded the contribution of any other branch of science.

To date, most of the effective hand sanitizer products are alcohol-based formulations containing 62%-95% of alcohol as it can denature the proteins of microbes and the ability to inactivate viruses. This systematic review correlated with the data available in Pubmed, and it will investigate the range of available hand sanitizers and their effectiveness as well as the formulation aspects, adverse effects, and recommendations to enhance the formulation efficiency and safety. Further, this article highlights the efficacy of alcohol-based hand sanitizer against the coronavirus.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jing, Jane Lee Jia; Pei Yi, Thong; Bose, Rajendran J C; McCarthy, Jason R; Tharmalingam, Nagendran; Madheswaran, Thiagarajan","journal":"International journal of environmental research and public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32403261/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17093326","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alcohol-based hand sanitizer","good hand hygiene","effective hand sanitizer products","range of available hand sanitizers","practice of proper hand sanitization","alcohol-based formulations","use of effective hand disinfecting agents","efficacy of alcohol","hospital settings","contact isolation","direct contact","formulation aspects","data available","formulation efficiency","strict infection control tool","various types","forms","airborne microorganism droplets","recommendations","coughs","antimicrobial soaps","water","effectiveness","sneezes","adverse effects","transmission chain","ability","pandemic outbreak","proteins of microbes","systematic review","public","utmost importance","coronavirus","viruses","situations","safety","Pubmed","article","success","date"],"language":"en"},

This Series paper examines the evidence for immune dysregulation in catatonia. Activation of the innate immune system is associated with mutism, withdrawal, and psychomotor retardation, which constitute the neurovegetative features of catatonia. Evidence is sparse and conflicting for acute-phase activation in catatonia, and whether this feature is secondary to immobility is unclear. Various viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections have been associated with catatonia, but it is primarily linked to CNS infections. The most common cause of autoimmune catatonia is N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, which can account for the full spectrum of catatonic features. Autoimmunity appears to cause catatonia less by systemic inflammation than by the downstream effects of specific actions on extracellular antigens. The specific association with NMDAR encephalitis supports a hypothesis of glutamatergic hypofunction in catatonia.","publish_time":"2019-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rogers, Jonathan P; Pollak, Thomas A; Blackman, Graham; David, Anthony S","journal":"Lancet Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44e7f0291b99258a00ce08264de9d0af7511f2b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185541.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31196793/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2215036619301907; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2215-0366(19)30190-7; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036619301907","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neurovegetative features of catatonia","common cause of autoimmune catatonia","NMDAR encephalitis","evidence","psychomotor retardation","immune dysregulation","specific association","psychomotor disorder","parasitic infections","CNS infections","innate immune system","acute-phase activation","spectrum of catatonic features","downstream effects of specific actions","N-methyl","mutism","D-aspartate receptor","stupor","hypothesis of glutamatergic hypofunction","extracellular antigens","posturing","withdrawal","systemic inflammation","Series paper","immobility","echophenomena","Autoimmunity"],"language":"en"},

We previously demonstrated that nucleocapsid-derived peptides chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes effectively elicited SARS-CoV-specific CTLs in mice. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes derived from a non-structural polyprotein 1a (pp1a) of SARS-CoV, and investigated whether liposomal peptides derived from pp1a were effective for CTL induction. Out of 30 peptides predicted on computational algorithms, nine peptides could significantly induce interferon gamma (IFN-\u03B3)-producing CD8\u002B T cells in mice. These peptides were coupled to the surface of liposomes, and inoculated into mice. Six liposomal peptides effectively induced IFN-\u03B3-producing CD8\u002B T cells and seven liposomal peptides including the six peptides primed CTLs showing in vivo killing activities. Further, CTLs induced by the seven liposomal peptides lysed an HLA-A*0201 positive cell line expressing naturally processed, pp1a-derived peptides. Of note, one of the liposomal peptides induced high numbers of long-lasting memory CTLs. These data suggest that surface-linked liposomal peptides derived from pp1a might offer an efficient CTL-based vaccine against SARS.","publish_time":"2009-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kohyama, Shunsuke; Ohno, Satoshi; Suda, Tatsuya; Taneichi, Maiko; Yokoyama, Shoichi; Mori, Masahito; Kobayashi, Akiharu; Hayashi, Hidenori; Uchida, Tetsuya; Matsui, Masanori","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/135ee40ed73a012b4afa76f8d8a55ad41ae3a97a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114085.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354209004574; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354209004574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19748524/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.09.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["liposomal peptides","pp1a-derived peptides","nucleocapsid-derived peptides","peptides primed CTLs","elicited SARS-CoV","specific CTLs","mice","T cells","surface of liposomes","induced IFN-\u03B3","CD8","non-structural proteins","CTL induction","HLA","high numbers of long-lasting memory CTLs","cytotoxic T lymphocytes","restricted CTL epitopes","efficient CTL-based vaccine","non-structural polyprotein","positive cell line","cell-mediated immunity","structural proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome","major targets","associated coronavirus","Abstract Spike","interferon gamma","thirds of viral genome","activities","computational algorithms","contrast","data","note"],"language":"en"},

These diseases can be caused by a range of organisms including bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi. Viral diseases are highly infectious and capable of causing pandemics as evidenced by outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, West Nile, SARS-Corona, Nipah, Hendra, Avian influenza and Swine influenza. EXPALANTION: Many viruses affecting equines are also important human pathogens. Diseases like Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Western equine encephalitis (WEE), and Venezuelan-equine encephalitis (VEE) are highly infectious and can be disseminated as aerosols. A large number of horses and human cases of VEE with fatal encephalitis have continuously occurred in Venezuela and Colombia. Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is prevalent in horses in North America and has zoonotic potential causing encephalitis in children. Hendra virus (HeV) causes respiratory and neurological disease and death in man and horses. Since its first outbreak in 1994, 53 disease incidents have been reported in Australia. West Nile fever has spread to many newer territories across continents during recent years. It has been described in Africa, Europe, South Asia, Oceania and North America. Japanese encephalitis has expanded horizons from Asia to western Pacific region including the eastern Indonesian archipelago, Papua New Guinea and Australia. Rabies is rare in horses but still a public health concern being a fatal disease. Equine influenza is historically not known to affect humans but many scientists have mixed opinions. Equine viral diseases of zoonotic importance and their impact on animal and human health have been elaborated in this article. CONCLUSION: Equine viral diseases though restricted to certain geographical areas have huge impact on equine and human health. Diseases like West Nile fever, Hendra, VS, VEE, EEE, JE, Rabies have the potential for spread and ability to cause disease in human. Equine influenza is historically not known to affect humans but some experimental and observational evidence show that H3N8 influenza virus has infected man. Despite our pursuit of understanding the complexity of the vector-host-pathogen mediating disease transmission, it is not possible to make generalized predictions concerning the degree of impact of disease emergence. A targeted, multidisciplinary effort is required to understand the risk factors for zoonosis and apply the interventions necessary to control it.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Balvinder; Manuja, Anju; Gulati, BR; Virmani, Nitin; Tripathi, B.N.","journal":"Open Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa6fd0de59bb82e7c94b044d8145fbd50d7c9b9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6142672.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2174/1874357901812010080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30288197/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Eastern"],"locations":["Middle East","Venezuela","Colombia","West Nile","Africa","Europe","South Asia","Oceania","North America","Asia","Pacific","Papua New Guinea","Australia"],"keyphrases":["Equine influenza","Zoonotic diseases","infectious diseases","Eastern equine encephalitis","Western equine encephalitis","outbreaks of diseases","Venezuelan-equine encephalitis","Equine viral diseases of zoonotic importance","human health","fatal encephalitis","fatal disease","Japanese encephalitis","neurological disease","disease transmission","disease incidents","disease emergence","human beings","human cases of VEE","Avian influenza","Swine influenza","West Nile fever","H3N8 influenza virus","important human pathogens","Hendra virus","zoonotic potential","huge impact","EEE","degree of impact","VS","North America","large number of horses","viruses","humans","Australia","Rabies","public health concern","South Asia","infected man","eastern Indonesian archipelago","western Pacific region","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","certain geographical areas","SARS-Corona","Papua New Guinea","Ebola","observational evidence","horizons","Nipah","newer territories","bacteria","parasites","Oceania","equines","JE","HeV","death","vector-host","zoonosis","continents","recent years","Europe","generalized predictions","range of organisms","pandemics","risk factors","complexity","scientists","mixed opinions","fungi","Vesicular stomatitis","Africa","children","ability","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSION","multidisciplinary effort","interventions necessary","EXPALANTION","animals","pursuit","Colombia","aerosols","article"],"language":"en"},

LV is tentatively classified in the family Arteriviridae, which consists of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). These viruses have a similar genome organization and replication strategy as coronaviruses, but the size of the genome is much smaller (12\u201315 kb) and they have different morphological and physicochemical properties. The genome of LV contains eight open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the replicase genes (ORFs 1a and 1b), envelope proteins (ORFs 2 to 6) and the nucleocapsid protein (ORF7). Genomic comparison of European and North American isolates has shown that the structural proteins encoded by ORFs 2 to 7 vary widely. The amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 of North American strains share only 55 to 79% identical amino acids with those of European strains. Using polyvalent porcine anti-LV serum, gene-specific anti-peptide sera and monoclonal antibodies, we have identified six structural proteins of LV and their corresponding genes. These are: the 15 kDa unglycosylated nucleocapsid protein (N) encoded by ORF7, an 18 kDa unglycosylated integral membrane protein M encoded by ORF6, a 25 kDa N-glycosylated protein encoded by ORF5, a 31\u201335 kDa N-glycosylated protein encoded by ORF4, a 45\u201350 kDa N-glycosylated protein encoded by ORF3 and a 29\u201330 kDa N-glycosylated protein encoded by ORF2.

The exposure was PM(2.5), and the confounders were weather (temperature and humidity) and other pollutants (PM(10), SO(2), CO, O(3), and NO(2)). The outcomes were emergency department (ED) visits with psychiatric disease codes (F00-F99 in ICD10 codes).

Subjects completed evaluation questionnaires before beginning their program and 1 week following the program. RESULTS: Analysis of covariance showed that the CDSMP participants demonstrated significantly higher self-efficacy in managing their illness, used more cognitive methods to manage pain and symptoms, and felt more energetic than the subjects in the comparison group. The CDSMP participants also demonstrated changes in their profile of coping strategies, having a tendency to adopt the cognitive methods of diverting attention, reinterpreting pain, ignoring sensations, and making positive self-statements. CONCLUSION: The short-term evaluation results showed that the CDSMP primarily increased the self-efficacy, exercise behavior, and application of cognitive coping strategies of the participants. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: The effect of the CDSMP in a Chinese population is similar to that found in studies in Western cultures, and the CDSMP could be applied effectively in a Chinese population.","publish_time":"2006-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siu, Andrew M.H.; Chan, Chetwyn C.H.; Poon, Peter K.K.; Chui, Dominic Y.Y.; Chan, Sam C.C.","journal":"Patient Educ Couns","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/407cb0b425ec88d59147a62c7c8f07a2c8345242.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135159.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399106001558; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0738399106001558","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["CDSMP participants","subjects","chronic illness","experimental group","higher self-efficacy","week Chronic Disease Self-Management Program","application of cognitive coping strategies","cognitive methods of diverting attention","positive self-statements","duration of illness","comparison groups","Chinese population","profile of coping strategies","short-term evaluation results","reinterpreting pain","evaluation questionnaires","sensations","exercise behavior","class","changes","Tai-Chi","effect","symptoms","tendency","total","mass-activity format","Hong Kong","Analysis of covariance","studies","study","CONCLUSION","Western cultures","PRACTICE IMPLICATION","gender","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Both the JHM and A59 strains, when inoculated intracranially or intranasally, are neurovirulent. Comparison of the highly virulent JHM isolate, JHM.SD, with less virulent JHM isolates and with A59 has been used to determine the mechanisms and genes responsible for high neuropathogenicity of MHV. The focus of this review is on the contributions of viral spread, replication and innate and adaptive immunity to MHV neuropathogenesis. JHM.SD spreads more quickly among neurons than less neurovirulent MHVs, and is able to spread in the absence of the canonical MHV receptor, CEACAM1a. The observation that JHM.SD infects more cells and expresses more antigen, but produces less infectious virus per cell than A59 implies that efficient replication is not always a correlate of high neurovirulence. This is likely due to the unstable nature of the JHM.SD spike protein (S). JHM.SD induces a generally protective innate immune response; however, the strong neutrophil response may be more pathogenic than protective. In addition JHM.SD induces only a minimal T cell response, while the strong T cell response and the concomitant IFN\u03B3 induced by the less neurovirulent A59 is protective. Differences in the S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins between A59 and JHM.SD contribute to JHM.SD neuropathogenicity. The hemmagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein may enhance neuropathogenicity of some MHV isolates, but is unlikely a major contributor to the high neuroviruence of JHM.SD. Further data suggests that neither the internal (I) protein, nor nonstructural proteins ns4, and ns2 are significant contributors to neurovirulence.","publish_time":"2010-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cowley, Timothy J.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Journal of Neurovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e22dd9e7142cd33799fa9113f98648b4c5b0a64.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2acb443982082784e3a39ec3e8e573688802fa7d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF03210848.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21073281/; https://doi.org/10.3109/13550284.2010.529238","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JHM","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neurovirulent A59","high neuropathogenicity of MHV","MHV isolates","MHV neuropathogenesis","A59 strains","strong T cell response","minimal T cell response","protective innate immune response","strong neutrophil response","canonical MHV receptor","virulent JHM isolates","high neuroviruence of","spike protein","correlate of high neurovirulence","neurovirulent MHVs","infectious virus","efficient replication","mouse hepatitis virus","nonstructural proteins ns4","contributions of viral spread","ns2","concomitant IFN\u03B3","nucleocapsid","genes responsible","significant contributors","major contributor","Murine coronavirus","adaptive immunity","unstable nature","absence","various diseases","mechanisms","review","antigen","neurons","data","CEACAM1a","Comparison","route of inoculation","cells","Differences","addition","hemmagglutinin-esterase","observation","focus","spreads"],"language":"en"},

However, this globalization has brought with it the rise of various pathogenic viral agents, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Zika virus, and Dengue virus. In particular, avian influenza virus (AIV) is highly infectious and causes economic, health, ethnical, and social problems to human beings, which has necessitated the development of an ultrasensitive and selective rapid-detection system of AIV. To prevent the damage associated with the spread of AIV, early detection and adequate treatment of AIV is key. There are traditional techniques that have been used to detect AIV in chickens, ducks, humans, and other living organisms. However, the development of a technique that allows for the more rapid diagnosis of AIV is still necessary. To achieve this goal, the present article reviews the use of an AIV biosensor employing nanobio hybrid materials to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of the technique while also reducing the detection time and high-throughput process time.

It is traditionally valued and reported for hair-blacking, liver and kidney-tonifying and anti-aging effects as well as low toxicity. The aim of this review is to provide comprehensive information on the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological research and toxicology of Polygonum multiflorum, based on the scientific literature. Moreover, trends and perspectives for future investigation of this plant are discussed. It will build up a new foundation for further study on Polygonum multiflorum. Materials and methods A systematic review of the literature on Polygonum multiflorum was performed using several resources, including classic books on Chinese herbal medicine and various scientific databases, such as PubMed, SciFinder, the Web of Science, Science Direct, China Knowledge Resource Integrated (CNKI). Results Polygonum multiflorum is widely distributed throughout the world and has been used as a traditional medicine for centuries in China. The ethnomedical uses of Polygonum multiflorum have been recorded in many provinces of China and Japan for nine species of adulterants in six families. More than 100 chemical compounds have been isolated from this plant, and the major components have been determined to be stilbenes, quinones, flavonoids and others. Crude extracts and pure compounds of this plant are used as effective agents in pre-clinical and clinical practice due to their anti-aging, anti-hyperlipidaemia, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects and to promote immunomodulation, neuroprotection, and the curing of other diseases. However, these extracts can also lead to hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and embryonic toxicity. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that the main components of Polygonum multiflorum, such as 2,3,5,4\u2032-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-\u03B2-d-glucopyranoside and emodin are distributed among many organs and tissues. Conclusion Therapeutic potential of Polygonum multiflorum has been demonstrated in the conditions like Alzheimer\u05F3s disease, Parkinson\u05F3s disease, hyperlipidaemia, inflammation and cancer, which is attributed to the presence of various stilbenes, quinones, flavonoids, phospholipids and other compounds in the drug. On the other hand, the adverse effects (hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and embryonic toxicity) of this plant were caused by the quinones, such as emodin and rhein. Thus more pharmacological and toxicological mechanisms on main active compounds are necessary to be explored, especially the combined anthraquinones (Emodin-8-O-\u03B2-d-glucopyranoside, Physcion-8-O-\u03B2-d-glucopyranoside, etc.) and the variety of stilbenes.","publish_time":"2015-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Longfei; Ni, Boran; Lin, Hongmei; Zhang, Miao; Li, Xuechun; Yin, Xingbin; Qu, Changhai; Ni, Jian","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e35e3a46c1655f1283ea5b4999aded0d6204f738.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127521.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25449462/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.11.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874114007922; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874114007922","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Heshouwu","Polygonum","Web of Science, Science Direct, China Knowledge Resource Integrated"],"locations":["China","Japan"],"keyphrases":["toxicology of Polygonum multiflorum","Results Polygonum multiflorum","main components of Polygonum multiflorum","plant","Conclusion Therapeutic potential of Polygonum multiflorum","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Polygonum multiflorum Thunb","anti-hyperlipidaemia","anti-aging effects","anti-cancer","\u03B2-d","d-glucopyranoside","Emodin-","pure compounds","provinces of China","embryonic toxicity","chemical compounds","main active compounds","s disease","anti-inflammatory effects","traditional medicine","adverse effects","hepatotoxicity","O-\u03B2","China Knowledge Resource","traditional uses","nephrotoxicity","scientific literature","presence of various stilbenes","low toxicity","flavonoids","variety of stilbenes","Chinese herbal medicine","various scientific databases","Science Direct","clinical practice","pharmacological research","Web of Science","systematic review","major components","Crude extracts","kidney-tonifying","phytochemistry","Parkinson","classic books","effective agents","toxicological mechanisms","liver","botany","PubMed","phospholipids","resources","Physcion-","hair-blacking","comprehensive information","SciFinder","immunomodulation","Japan","perspectives","future investigation","methods","Alzheimer","inflammation","conditions","study","species of adulterants","new foundation","curing","trends","Materials","neuroprotection","CNKI","hand","\u4F55\u9996\u4E4C","centuries","Pharmacokinetic studies","combined anthraquinones","families","Heshouwu","organs","tetrahydroxystilbene","drug","rhein","ethnomedical","tissues","diseases","aim","world"],"language":"en"},

The results revealed that strains ck/CH/LNM/091017 and ck/CH/LDL/101212 were closely related to the H120 vaccine, which suggests that they might represent re-isolations of vaccine strains or variants of vaccine strains that have resulted from the accumulated point mutations after several passages in chickens. In contrast, strains ck/CH/LHLJ/07VII and ck/CH/LHLJ/100902 had a close genetic relationship with the pathogenic M41 strain. In addition, molecular markers have been identified that distinguish between field and vaccine (or vaccine-like) Mass-type viruses, which may be able to differentiate between field and vaccine strains for diagnostic purposes. Phylogenetic analysis, and pairwise comparison of full-length genomes and the nine genes, identified the occurrence of recombination events in the genome of strain CK/VH/LHLJ/07VII, which suggests that this virus originated from recombination events between M41- and H120-like strains at the switch site located at the 3\u2032 end of the nucleocapsid (N) genes. To our knowledge, this is the first time that evidence for the evolution and natural recombination under field conditions between Mass-type pathogenic and vaccinal IBV strains has been documented. These findings provide insights into the emergence and evolution of the Mass-type IB coronaviruses and may help to explain the emergence of Mass-type IBV in chicken flocks all over the world.","publish_time":"2012-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Xiaoli; Shao, Yuhao; Ma, Huijie; Sun, Chuyang; Zhang, Xiaonan; Li, Chengren; Han, Zongxi; Yan, Baolong; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0bf25ee11173cc87455e3b99254a5474499ecb4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106298.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23178317/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2012.09.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134812003292; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134812003292","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strains ck","H120 vaccine strains","variants of vaccine strains","Mass-type pathogenic","type IBV","re-isolations of vaccine strains","vaccinal IBV strains","Mass-type viruses","Massachusetts-type","emergence of Mass","Mass-type IB coronaviruses","strains of infectious bronchitis coronavirus","LHLJ","pathogenic M41 strain","genome of strain CK","evolution","natural recombination","field conditions","occurrence of recombination events","genes","close genetic relationship","chicken flocks","LNM","complete genomic sequences","passages","accumulated point mutations","evidence","VH","diagnostic purposes","comparison of full-length genomes","end","chickens","nucleocapsid","time","insights","switch site","results","contrast","Phylogenetic analysis","addition","molecular markers","world","findings","LDL","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

Patients were prospectively enrolled in a single-center study. Dual modality chest PET/computed tomography (CT) scans were performed, with (18)F-FDG emission scans for quantification of regional (18)F-FDG uptake and CT scans with radiocontrast agent to check for pulmonary artery thrombosis. Regional lung (18)F-FDG uptake was quantified in ACS patients and in SCD patients without ACS (SCD non-ACS controls). Maximal (SUVmax) and mean (SUVmean) standardized uptake values were computed. Seventeen patients with ACS (mean age 28.3 \u00B1 6.4 years) were included. None died nor required invasive mechanical ventilation. The main lung opacity on CT scans was lower lobe consolidation. Lungs of patients with ACS exhibited higher SUVmax than those of SCD non-ACS controls (2.5 [2.1\u20132.9] vs 0.8 [0.6\u20131.0]; P \u003C 0.0001).

We compared the deposition fractions of sodium chloride (NaCl) particles with a range of aerodynamic diameters (1\u20138 \u03BCm) in cluster archetypes under conditions with and without hygroscopic growth. The temperature and water vapor distributions in the airways were simulated with an airway wall boundary condition that accounts for variable temperature and water vapor evaporation at the interface between the lumen and the airway surface liquid layer. On average, the deposition fraction increased by about 6% due to hygroscopic particle growth in the cluster subjects with constricted airways, while it increased by only about 0.5% in those with non-constricted airways. The effect of particle growth was most significant for particles with an initial diameter of [Formula: see text] in the cluster subjects with constricted airways. The effect diminished with increasing particle size, especially for particles with an initial diameter larger than 4 \u03BCm. This suggests the necessity to differentiate asthmatic subjects by cluster in engineering the aerosol size for tailored treatment. Specifically, the treatment of severe asthmatic subjects who have constricted airways with inhalation aerosols may need submicron-sized hygroscopic particles to compensate for particle growth, if one targets for delivering to the peripheral region. These results could potentially inform the choice of particle size for inhalational drug delivery in a cluster-specific manner.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajaraman, Prathish K.; Choi, Jiwoong; Hoffman, Eric A.; O\u0027Shaughnessy, Patrick T.; Choi, Sanghun; Delvadia, Renishkumar; Babiskin, Andrew; Walenga, Ross; Lin, Ching-Long","journal":"J Aerosol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0dface3b990e722daf092f9331a3b4814192dfe7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187883.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105581; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850220300707; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220300707?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346183/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cluster subjects","non-constricted airways","deposition of particles","hygroscopic particle growth","effect of particle growth","treatment of severe asthmatic subjects","hygroscopic growth","cluster archetypes","choice of particle size","increasing particle size","severe asthmatic lungs","severe asthmatic clusters","study human subjects","submicron-sized hygroscopic particles","cluster-specific manner","aerosol size","\u03BCm","effect of hygroscopicity","water vapor evaporation","distinct airway structures","water vapor distributions","initial diameter larger","variable temperature","airway wall boundary condition","airway surface liquid layer","deposition fractions of sodium chloride","tailored treatment","accounts","inhalational drug delivery","lumen","NaCl","interface","inhalation aerosols","lower left lobe","imaging","conditions","transport","range of aerodynamic diameters","targets","text","LLL","Formula","necessity","peripheral region","average","results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The research objects were 55 cases of suspected COVID-19 pregnant women who gave a birth from Jan 20th 2020 to Mar 5th 2020 in our hospital-a big birth center delivering about 30,000 babies in the last 3 years. These cases were subjected to pulmonary CT scan and routine blood test, manifested symptoms of fever, cough, chest tightness or gastrointestinal symptoms. They were admitted to an isolated suite, with clinical features and newborn babies being carefully observed. Among the 55 cases, 13 patients were assigned into the confirmed COVID-19 group for being tested positive sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) via maternal throat swab test, and the other 42 patients were assigned into the control group for being ruled out COVID-19 pneumonia based on new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control program(the 7th edition). RESULTS: There were 2 fever patients during the prenatal period and 8 fever patients during the postpartum period in the confirmed COVID-19 group. In contrast, there were 11 prenatal fever patients and 20 postpartum fever patients in the control group (p\u003E0.05). Among 55 cases, only 2 case had cough in the confirmed group. The imaging of pulmonary CT scan showed ground- glass opacity (46.2%, 6/13), patch-like shadows(38.5%, 5/13), fiber shadow(23.1%, 3/13), pleural effusion (38.5%, 5/13)and pleural thickening(7.7%, 1/13), and there was no statistical difference between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group (p\u003E0.05). During the prenatal and postpartum period, there was no difference in the count of WBC, Neutrophils and Lymphocyte, the radio of Neutrophils and Lymphocyte and the level of CRP between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group(p\u003C0.05). 20 babies (from confirmed mother and from normal mother) were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 examination by throat swab samples in 24 h after birth and no case was tested positive. CONCLUSION: The clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators are not obvious for asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 pregnant women. Pulmonary CT scan plus blood routine examination are more suitable for finding pregnancy women with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection, and can be used screening COVID-19 pregnant women in the outbreak area of COVID-19 infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"yang, Hui; Sun, Guoqiang; Tang, Fei; Peng, Min; Gao, Ying; Peng, Jing; Xie, Hui; Zhao, Yun; Jin, Zhichun","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f008cf7398eda93b694701220cc5a8739c373d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152867.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294503/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320302127; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320302127","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","Neutrophils and Lymphocyte"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["confirmed COVID","confirmed group","mild COVID","control group","screening COVID","cases of suspected COVID","postpartum fever patients","prenatal fever patients","outbreak area of COVID","confirmed mother","outcomes of pregnant women","circumstance pregnant women","pregnancy women","manifested symptoms of fever","clinical symptoms","control program","postpartum period","prenatal period","imaging of pulmonary CT scan","clinical features","blood routine examination","routine blood test","cough","gastrointestinal symptoms","Lymphocyte","SARS-CoV","infection","newborn babies","new coronavirus pneumonia prevention","maternal throat swab test","novel coronavirus disease","throat swab samples","big birth center","acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","radio of Neutrophils","normal mother","statistical difference","pleural effusion","pleural thickening","laboratory indicators","chest tightness","ground- glass opacity","research objects","level of CRP","count of WBC","isolated suite","hospital","BACKGROUND","study","CONCLUSION","METHODS","edition","contrast","RESULTS","patch","shadows","fiber shadow","worldwide pandemic","OBJECTIVE","years"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Acute tonsillopharyngitis is one of the most common childhood diseases. Viruses are the most frequent origin. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is the main bacterial cause. A culture or a rapid antigen-detection test of a throat-swab specimen should only be done on the basis of clinical scores, in order to avoid over-diagnosis of bacterial origin and unnecessary antibiotic prescription. The objectives of treatment are: the reduction of symptoms, reduce the contagious period, and prevent local suppurative and systemic complications. Ideally, only confirmed cases should receive antibiotics. If there is no possibility to perform a rapid antigen-detection test, or in some cases if the result is negative, it is recommended to perform a culture and, if there is high suspicious index, to prescribe antibiotics. Penicillin is the treatment of choice, although amoxicillin is also accepted as the first option. Amoxicillin/clavulanate is not indicated in any case as empirical treatment. Macrolides are not a first choice antibiotic, and should be reserved for those patients with immediate penicillin allergy reaction or for the treatment of streptococcal carriers. It is of primordial importance to adapt the prescribing of antibiotics to the scientific evidence.","publish_time":"2011-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pi\u00F1eiro P\u00E9rez, R.; Hijano Bandera, F.; \u00C1lvez Gonz\u00E1lez, F.; Fern\u00E1ndez Landaluce, A.; Silva Rico, J.

As the only flying mammal, bats endure high metabolic rates yet exhibit elongated lifespans. It is currently unclear whether these unique features are interlinked. The important inflammasome sensor, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), has been linked to both viral-induced and age-related inflammation. Here, we report significantly dampened activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bat primary immune cells compared to human or mouse counterparts. Lower induction of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) speck formation and secretion of interleukin-1\u03B2 in response to both \u2018sterile\u2019 stimuli and infection with multiple zoonotic viruses including influenza A virus (\u2212single-stranded (ss) RNA), Melaka virus (PRV3M, double-stranded RNA) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (\u002BssRNA) was observed. Importantly, this reduction of inflammation had no impact on the overall viral loads.

Initially, conserved and antigenic helper T\u2010lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes in the HEV capsid protein were predicted by in silico analysis. Subsequently, a multiepitope comprising four HTL epitopes with high\u2010affinity binding to the HLA molecules was designed, and repeated four times as high density multiepitope construct. This construct was synthesized and cloned into pET\u201030a (\u002B) vector. Then, it was transformed and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The high density multiepitope protein was purified by Ni\u2010NTA agarose and concentrated using Amicon filters. Finally, the immunological properties of this high density multiepitope protein were evaluated in vitro. The results showed that the high density multiepitope construct was successfully expressed and purified. SDS\u2010PAGE and Western blot analyses showed the presence of a high density multiepitope protein band of approximately 33 kDa. Approximately 1 mg of the purified protein was obtained from each liter of the culture media. Moreover, the purified multiepitope protein was capable of induction of proliferation responses, IFN\u2010\u03B3 ELISPOT responses and IFN\u2010\u03B3 and IL\u201012 cytokines production in a significant level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from HEV\u2010recovered individuals compared to the control group. In conclusion, the newly produced multiepitope protein can induce significant T helper type 1 responses in vitro, and can be considered as a novel strategy for the development of HEV vaccines in the future.

By contrast, the role of rotavirus as a pathogen in adults has long been underappreciated. Spread by faecal-oral transmission, rotavirus infection in adults typically manifests with nausea, malaise, headache, abdominal cramping, diarrhoea, and fever. Infection can also be symptomless. Rotavirus infection in immuno-compromised adults can have a variable course from symptomless to severe and sustained infection. Common epidemiological settings for rotavirus infection among adults include endemic disease, epidemic outbreak, travel-related infection, and disease resulting from child-to-adult transmission. Limited diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives are available for adults with suspected rotavirus infection. Because symptoms are generally self-limiting, supportive care is the rule. Clinicians caring for adults with gastroenteritis should consider rotavirus in the differential diagnosis. In this review we intend to familiarise clinicians who primarily provide care for adult patients with the salient features of rotavirus pathophysiology, clinical presentation, epidemiology, treatment, and prevention.","publish_time":"2004-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anderson, Evan J; Weber, Stephen G","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24e96c4bc16cfcb69cb4d9441c13fbe063c7e854.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106507.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309904009284; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309904009284","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["suspected rotavirus infection","role of rotavirus","Summary Rotavirus","sustained infection","travel-related infection","salient features of rotavirus pathophysiology","immuno-compromised adults","adult transmission","Clinicians","endemic disease","common cause of infectious gastroenteritis","supportive care","adult patients","Common epidemiological settings","faecal-oral transmission","epidemic outbreak","clinical presentation","infants","epidemiology","variable course","abdominal cramping","therapeutic alternatives","headache","malaise","nausea","diarrhoea","treatment","Limited diagnostic","young children","fever","symptoms","rule","years","pathogen","differential diagnosis","prevention","contrast","review"],"language":"en"},

An equal area breaks classification aims to obtain a coloring for the map such that the area associated with each of the colors is approximately equal. This is meant to be an alternative to an approach that assigns an equal number of regions with a particular range of property values to each color, called quantiles, which could result in the mapped area being dominated by one or a few colors. Moreover, it is possible that the other colors are barely discernible. This is the case when some regions are much larger than others (e.g., compare Switzerland with Russia). A number of algorithms of varying computational complexity are presented to achieve an equal area assignment to regions. They include a pair of greedy algorithms, as well as an optimal algorithm that is based on dynamic programming. The classification obtained from the optimal equal area algorithm is compared with the quantiles and Jenks natural breaks algorithms and found to be superior from a visual standpoint by a user study. Finally, a modified approach is presented which enables users to vary the extent to which the coloring algorithm satisfies the conflicting goals of equal area for each color with that of assigning an equal number of regions to each color.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abboud, Anis; Kastner, John; Samet, Hanan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01653v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jenks"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Switzerland","Russia"],"keyphrases":["equal area assignment","optimal equal area algorithm","equal number of regions","conflicting goals of equal area","mapped area","number of algorithms","optimal algorithm","coloring algorithm","colors","efficient algorithm","geographical quantiles","Jenks natural breaks algorithms","choropleth map classification scheme","pair of greedy algorithms","modified approach","particular range of property values","varying computational complexity","visual standpoint","user study","users","extent","dynamic programming","case","Switzerland","Russia","alternative"],"language":"en"},

The greatest challenge that most governments are currently suffering from is the lack of a precise mechanism to detect unknown infected cases and predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus. In response to mitigate this challenge, this study proposes a novel innovative approach for mitigating big challenges of (COVID-19) coronavirus propagation and contagion. This study propose a blockchain-based framework which investigate the possibility of utilizing peer-to peer, time stamping, and decentralized storage advantages of blockchain to build a new system for verifying and detecting the unknown infected cases of COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the proposed framework will enable the citizens to predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus within conglomerates of people or within public places through a novel design of P2P-Mobile Application. The proposed approach is forecasted to produce an effective system able to support governments, health authorities, and citizens to take critical decision regarding the infection detection, infection prediction, and infection avoidance. The framework is currently being developed and implemented as a new system consists of four components, Infection Verifier Subsystem, Blockchain platform, P2P-Mobile Application, and Mass-Surveillance System.

The compensated string is similar to the conventional cosmic string in the Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) string, around which only the would-be Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson winds. Around the uncompensated string, on the other hand, the physical NG boson also winds, where the physical NG boson is associated with the spontaneous breaking of the enhanced symmetry. Our previous simulation in the 2\u002B1 dimensional spacetime confirmed that both the compensated/uncompensated strings are formed at the phase transition of the symmetry breaking. Non-trivial winding of the physical NG boson around the strings potentially causes the so-called axion domain-wall problem when the model is applied to the axion model. In this paper, we perform simulation in the 3\u002B1 dimensional spacetime to discuss the fate of the uncompensated strings. We observe that the evolution of the string-network is highly complicated in the 3\u002B1 dimensional simulation compared with that seen in the previous simulation. Despite such complications, we find that the number of the uncompensated strings which could cause can be highly suppressed at late times. Our observation suggests that the present setup can be applied to the axion model without suffering from the axion domain-wall problem.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hiramatsu, Takashi; Ibe, Masahiro; Suzuki, Motoo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10421v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["uncompensated strings","axion model","physical NG boson","string-network","dimensional simulation","cosmic string solutions","previous simulation","conventional cosmic string","boson winds","enhanced symmetry","dimensional spacetime","so-called axion domain-wall problem","Abelian-Higgs model","global symmetry","previous work","spontaneous breaking","Abrikosov-Nielsen","new types","suffering","hand","Non-trivial winding","would-be Nambu-Goldstone","Olesen","ANO","fate","phase transition","number","present setup","observation","evolution","late times","complications","paper"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we investigate this problem using the data from the cases with symptom-onset dates from January 19 to February 10, 2020 for 100 Chinese cities, and cases with confirmed dates from March 15 to April 25 for 1,005 U.S. counties. Statistical analysis is performed to assess the relationship between the transmissibility of COVID-19 and the temperature/humidity, by controlling for various demographic, socio-economic, geographic, healthcare and policy factors and correcting for cross-sectional correlation. We find a similar influence of the temperature and relative humidity on effective reproductive number (R values) of COVID-19 for both China and the U.S. before lockdown in both countries: one-degree Celsius increase in temperature reduces R value by about 0.023 (0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in China and 0.020 (95% CI [-0.0311, -0.0096]) in the U.S.), and one percent relative humidity rise reduces R value by 0.0078 (0.0076 (95% CI [-0.0108,-0.0045]) in China and 0.0080 (95% CI [-0.0150,-0.0010]) in the U.S.). If assuming a 30 degree and 25 percent increase in temperature and relative humidity from winter to summer in the northern hemisphere, we expect the R values to decline about 0.89 (0.69 by temperature and 0.20 by humidity). Given the notion that the non-intervened R values are around 2.5 to 3, only weather factors cannot make the R values below their critical condition of R\u003C1, under which the epidemic diminishes gradually. Therefore, public health intervention such as social distancing is crucial to block the transmission of COVID-19 even in summer.","publish_time":"2020-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jingyuan; Tang, Ke; Feng, Kai; Li, Xin; Lv, Weifeng; Chen, Kun; Wang, Fei","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f57a6e2e5ac028f365abb30e14948ab4c29748ce.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05003v4.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","U.S."],"keyphrases":["temperature","increased humidity","transmission of COVID","non-intervened R values","percent relative humidity rise","critical condition of R","transmissibility of COVID","China","transmission intensity of COVID","percent increase","northern hemisphere","cases","coming summer","ongoing global pandemic of COVID","degree Celsius increase","policy factors","weather factors","confirmed dates","symptom-onset dates","effective reproductive number","winter","social distancing","healthcare","various demographic","public health intervention","countries","notion","Chinese cities","similar influence","problem","data","cross-sectional correlation","relationship","question","lockdown","Statistical analysis","paper","counties","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

I introduce three extensions to these models to fit the daily arrivals in French hospitals, as well in critical care, releases and deaths. These models involve ratios of evolutionary timescales to branching fractions, assumed uniform throughout a country, and the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, before and during the national lockdown, for each region of France. The hospital data are well fit by the models with the exception of the arrivals in critical care, which are found to decrease in time faster than predicted by all models. This suggests that hospitals have learnt over time to better treat COVID-19 patients without resorting to critical care. The basic reproductive factor, averaged over France, was $R_0$=3.4$\\pm$0.1 before the lockdown and 0.65$\\pm$0.04 (90% c.l.) during it, both with small regional variations.

The fraction of immunized people reached a plateau below 1% throughout France (3% in Paris) by late April 2020 (95% c.l.), suggesting a lack of herd immunity and that a second wave of the pandemic is possible during the partial lifting of the national lockdown. After the partial lifting of the lockdown, if $R_0$ is as high as 1.5, then a second wave will lead to 60 thousand deaths by mid-July and over a million by October, while if $R_0$ is 1.2 or lower, the pandemic is delayed with deaths rising as late as August, allowing for timely governmental response.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mamon, Gary A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e302274f255ae85eb87c195ea7c3dfbbdb08c9e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06552v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Infection Fatality Rate"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["national lockdown","models","deaths","region of France","critical care","fractions of people","partial lifting","pandemic","wave","decrease","better treat COVID","daily arrivals","French hospitals","time faster","ratios of evolutionary timescales","SIR evolutionary model","basic reproduction number","basic reproductive factor","fraction of immunized people","country","patients","exception","assumed uniform","plateau","early phases","Infection Fatality Rate","social distancing","releases","start","lack of herd immunity","hospital data","small regional variations","timely governmental response","Paris","extensions"],"language":"en"},

The effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect others without themselves being detected. In this paper, we attempt to interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number $R_{t}$ of the virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection and prevent it from exploding exponentially. We test the predictive ability of our model by matching predictions in the duration 3 March - 1 April 2020 for Wuhan and in the duration 25 March - 1 April 2020 for Italy and South Korea. In the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dandekar, Raj; Barbastathis, George","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebcab70ad3b2030adf82c372682b4b22a3ce678b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02752v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","United States","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["isolation measures","reversing quarantine measures","quarantine policies","Wuhan","spread of infection","neural network model","halting of infection","neural network augmented model","countries","South Korea","Italy","role","duration","strict public health measures","infected case count","available data","current infected curve growth","rapid government interventions","principles epidemiological equations","wide variety of social distancing","effective reproduction number","matching predictions","United States of America","China","exponential explosion","Hubei province","analysis","locales","predictive ability","individuals travel","Covid","effectiveness","responses","recording","virus","disease","results","paper"],"language":"en"},

The model is fitted to data from the Ontario (Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions are made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current effect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS.

Nevertheless, many phases of matter are known to admit a sign-problem-free representative, allowing efficient simulations on classical computers. Motivated by long standing open problems in many-body physics, as well as fundamental questions in quantum complexity, the possibility of intrinsic sign problems, where a phase of matter admits no sign-problem-free representative, was recently raised but remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish the existence of an intrinsic sign problem in a broad class of gapped, chiral, topological phases of matter. Within this class, we exclude the possibility of stoquastic Hamiltonians for bosons (or \u0027qudits\u0027), and of sign-problem-free determinantal Monte Carlo algorithms for fermions. The intrinsically sign-problematic class of phases we identify is defined in terms of topological invariants with clear observable signatures: the chiral central charge, and the topological spins of anyons. We obtain analogous results for phases that are spontaneously chiral, and present evidence for an extension of our results that applies to both chiral and non-chiral topological matter.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Golan, Omri; Smith, Adam; Ringel, Zohar","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69a3b1f7059e16ee3c9846bc0e91195f33e1d261.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05566v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Monte Carlo"],"keyphrases":["sign-problem","infamous sign problem","topological phases of matter","non-chiral topological matter","possibility of intrinsic sign problems","problematic class of phases","free representative","phase of matter","chiral central charge","quantum complexity","terms of topological invariants","topological spins of anyons","free determinantal Monte Carlo algorithms","Monte Carlo simulations of generic","body quantum systems","broad class of gapped","exponential complexity","efficient simulations","body physics","analogous results","possibility of stoquastic Hamiltonians","standing open problems","clear observable signatures","fundamental questions","fermions","bosons","classical computers","present evidence","extension","qudits","existence"],"language":"en"},

We used the Bayes factor between the model with two different R values and that with a single R value to justify that the change in R is statistically significant. We validated our approach using simulated data, generated using known R. In particular, we found that claiming two distinct R values may depend significantly on the number of outbreaks.

In this work, we plug this gap through market based mechanisms designed to efficiently allocate capacity constrained public goods. To design these mechanisms, we leverage the theory of Fisher markets, wherein each agent in the economy is endowed with an artificial currency budget that they can spend to avail public goods. While Fisher markets provide a strong methodological backbone to model resource allocation problems, their applicability is limited to settings involving two types of constraints - budgets of individual buyers and capacities of goods. The presence of additional physical constraints that arise in public goods allocation problems motivates the need for modifications to the Fisher market framework to account for these more general set of constraints. In our market mechanism, we specifically modify the Fisher market social optimization problem through a perturbation of the budgets of agents. The budget perturbations are set based on the dual variables of the additional physical constraints such that the KKT conditions of the newly defined social and individual optimization problems are equivalent. This establishes that our mechanism sets market clearing prices such that each agent obtains their maximum possible utilities subject to their constraints. Finally, to compute the perturbation constants we present a fixed point scheme, establish the existence of a unique fixed point and present numerical experiments to illustrate convergence guarantees. Thus, our mechanism, both theoretically and computationally, overcomes a fundamental limitation of Fisher markets, which only consider capacity and budget constraints.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jalota, Devansh; Pavone, Marco; Ye, Yinyu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10765v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["budget constraints","types of constraints","market mechanism","public goods allocation problems","social distance constraints","Fisher market framework","general set of constraints","market based mechanisms","capacity constrained public goods","Fisher market social optimization problem","presence of additional physical constraints","theory of Fisher markets","capacities of goods","public spaces","fundamental limitation of Fisher markets","individual optimization problems","market clearing prices","budget perturbations","model resource allocation problems","unique fixed point","fixed point scheme","budgets of individual buyers","absence of regulatory mechanisms","artificial currency budget","perturbation constants","budgets of agents","present numerical experiments","strong methodological backbone","need","existence","modifications","KKT conditions","applicability","maximum possible utilities subject","pandemic","account","dual variables","convergence guarantees","gap","case","economy","Covid","settings","number of people"],"language":"en"},

To date the novel COVID-19 coronavirus is rapidly spreading worldwide and subsequently threatening health of billions of humans. Clinical studies have shown that most COVID-19 patients suffer from the lung infection. Although chest CT has been shown to be an effective imaging technique for lung-related disease diagnosis, chest Xray is more widely available due to its faster imaging time and considerably lower cost than CT. Deep learning, one of the most successful AI techniques, is an effective means to assist radiologists to analyze the vast amount of chest X-ray images, which can be critical for efficient and reliable COVID-19 screening. In this work, we aim to develop a new deep anomaly detection model for fast, reliable screening. To evaluate the model performance, we have collected 100 chest X-ray images of 70 patients confirmed with COVID-19 from the Github repository. To facilitate deep learning, more data are needed. Thus, we have also collected 1431 additional chest X-ray images confirmed as other pneumonia of 1008 patients from the public ChestX-ray14 dataset.

In this brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by means of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we introduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all infected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that they cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is determined by the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_0$ (the number of newly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different compared to that for the standard SIR model. If $\\mathcal{R}_0\u003E1$, then the number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if $\\mathcal{R}_0\u003C1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions imposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays exponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease development in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth dynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth). Analysis of the data in China and Korea shows that the peak of infection (maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting measures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the total number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate remains exponential in Italy. Arguably, it suggests that the introduced quarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Volpert, Vitaly; Banerjee, Malay; Petrovskii, Sergei","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d57dbb91b90bcf03f1d60a016d374d5b83f7e985.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09444v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","South Korea","Korea","Europe"],"keyphrases":["growth dynamics","growth rate","number of infected decays","growth-decays dynamics","significant growth","total number of infected","different countries","infected individuals","strict quarantine measures","efficiency of quarantine measures","number of new cases","stricter measures","restricting measures","introduced quarantine","mathcal","basic reproduction number","different effect","new model of infection progression","incubation period","standard SIR model","classical SIR model","patchy dynamics","China","Italy","Disease progression","period of time","peak of infection","disease development","South Korea","available data","maximum of daily cases","contact restrictions","assumption","public authorities","possible patterns","spread of coronavirus","way","days","mathematical modelling","Analysis","Europe","brief note","people"],"language":"en"},

This immunity arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus the extinguishing of nascent epidemics.

As usage decreases there is a novel\u0022contact tracing\u0022phase transition to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for COVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the proportion of non-symptomatic transmission.

Our approach is motivated by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two populations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which the infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non confined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The model, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following a specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the differential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is observed in the COVID-19 epidemic. Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our model. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by just analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn out that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it became noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of all our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a rekindling of the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second epidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the scenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but typically a progressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the progressive exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too different. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise exit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major part of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but obeying rigorous distancing constraints.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakamura, G.; Grammaticos, B.; Badoual, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b8331cea4660562276b48ec88ffb34ca1a911de.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09314v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virulent epidemic","epidemic peak","progressive exit","confinement scenarios","stepwise exit","simple SIR model","overall confinement times","impact of various confinement strategies","differential system","discrete system","lockdown constraints","various imperatives","current COVID","simple structure","rigorous distancing constraints","existence","order","simulations","populations of susceptible persons","universal feature","specific procedure","promising strategy","world months","integrator","rekindling","main hypothesis","fragile groups","fact","implementation","results","approach","pandemic","infection rate","conditions","genesis","data","swing","conclusions"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test, however, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity. Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging. Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs, however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and require large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of handling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images show that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models.

Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities. We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic reproduction number is less than $2.3$. This condition is valid for the outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vattay, Gabor","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a414e697528a157a8601dc2c785262345e19c28.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08973v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["Spain","China"],"keyphrases":["basic reproduction number","SIR model","cumulative number of fatalities","cumulative number of deaths","SEIR model","large number of empirical parameters","China","Italy","master equation","Spain","master variable","Detailed epidemic models","logistic growth model","Hubei Province","outcome of outbreaks","complex models","separation policy","separation of timescales","explicit single variable differential equation","evolution","social distancing","size","susceptible population","internal variables","effects of protective measures","shorter infectious period","good approximation","equations","tools","infection rate","difference","relationship","New York","systematic errors","Real-time data","reporting","condition","sufficient accuracy","absence","paper"],"language":"en"},

As recent radiological literatures on Covid-19 related pneumonia is primarily focused on CT findings, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends using portable chest X-radiograph (CXR). A tool to assist for detection and monitoring of Covid-19 cases from CXR is highly required. Purpose: To develop a fully automatic framework to detect Covid-19 related pneumonia using CXR images and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: In this study, a novel deep learning model, named CovIDNet (Covid-19 Indonesia Neural-Network), was developed to extract visual features from chest x-ray images for the detection of Covid-19 related pneumonia. The model was trained and validated by chest x-rays datasets collected from several open source provided by GitHub and Kaggle. Results and Discussion: In the validation stage using open-source data, the accuracy to recognize Covid-19 and others classes reaches 98.44%, that is, 100% Covid-19 precision and 97% others precision. Discussion: The use of the model to classify Covid-19 and other pathologies might slightly decrease the accuracy. Although SoftMax was used to handle classification bias, this indicates the benefit of additional training upon the introduction of new set of data. Conclusion: The model has been tested and get 98.4% accuracy for open source datasets, the sensitivity and specificity are 100% and 96.97%, respectively.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramadhan, M.

Once available, vaccine is gradually produced, evoking the question on how to distribute it best. While official vaccination guidelines largely focus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first (e.g. to risk groups), here we propose a generic strategy for their distribution in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate. To demonstrate this strategy, we develop an agent-based model describing the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to vaccination. For heterogeneous infection patterns, the proposed strategy at least halves the number of deaths in our simulations compared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines proportionally to the population density. This applies for a wide range of reproduction numbers and vaccine production rates and might stimulate discussions on the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines for official guidelines.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grauer, Jens; Lowen, Hartmut; Liebchen, Benno","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e4ae835d7adc8fb0f60b3b1a36dd96864b858d9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04056v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["heterogeneous infection patterns","spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines","proposed strategy","generic strategy","official guidelines","official vaccination guidelines","question","vaccine production rates","rapid development of vaccine","time-evolution","number of deaths","thousands of deaths","high local infection growth rate","wide range of reproduction numbers","economic damage","desire","regions","discussions","trillions of dollars","simulations","agent-based model","importance","response","standard practice","space","population density","risk groups","Covid"],"language":"en"},

We first describe the mobility dynamics of the urban population as the process of leaving from home, traveling to and from the activity locations, and engaging in activities. We then embed the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) process over the mobility dynamics and develops the spatial SEIR model with travel contagion (Trans-SEIR), which explicitly accounts for contagions both during travel and during daily activities. We investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed model and show how activity contagion and travel contagion contribute to the average number of secondary infections. In the numerical experiments, we explore how the urban transportation system may alter the fundamental dynamics of the infectious disease, change the number of secondary infections, promote the synchronization of the disease across the city, and affect the peak of the disease outbreaks. The Trans-SEIR model is further applied to the understand the disease dynamics during the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City, where we show how the activity and travel contagion may be distributed and how effective travel control can be implemented with only limited resources. The Trans-SEIR model along with the findings in our study may have significant contributions to improving our understanding of the coupling between urban transportation and disease dynamics, the development of quarantine and control measures of disease system, and promoting the idea of disease-resilient urban transportation networks.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Xinwu; Ukkusuri, Satish V.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd890df0a02c8c9dc092691079d8691cea4f1f3a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04583v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease dynamics","mobility dynamics","travel contagion","Trans-SEIR model","fundamental dynamics","idea of disease","disease outbreaks","spatial SEIR model","activity contagion","urban transportation systems","spreading dynamics of infectious diseases","urban population","proposed model","control measures of disease system","mathematical model","resilient urban transportation networks","effective travel control","coupling","process","activity locations","study","average number of secondary infections","daily activities","New York City","development of quarantine","COVID","understanding","findings","synchronization","significant contributions","theoretical properties","peak","contagions","limited resources","numerical experiments","home"],"language":"en"},

This can be done by pooling individual samples (in groups, and only test those groups for the presence of a pathogen. The rationale is that if prevalence is low, many of these groups will ideally test negative, clearing all all individuals from such groups, whereas individuals appearing in (ideally few) positive groups will require further screening. Forming those groups in order to minimize testing costs while maintaining good detection is the goal of group testing algorithms. We propose a new framework to form such groups that takes into account various constraints of the testing environment, and which can easily incorporate individualized infection priors. Our solution solves a Bayesian sequential experimental design problem: Given previous group test results, we sample the posterior distribution of infection status vectors using sequential Monte Carlo samplers; these samples are then fed to an optimizer, which seeks to form groups that maximize an information gain if those future tests were to be known. To output marginal probabilities of infection, we use loopy belief propagation as a decoder.

The Spike (S) glycoprotein has been identified as a major target of protective immunity and contains at least three regions that are targeted by neutralizing antibodies in the S1 and S2 domains. We previously characterized a panel of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) but the majority of epitopes recognized by the MAbs remained unknown. METHODS: In this study we generated neutralization escape mutants and studied the effect of these neutralization escape mutations on human and animal receptor usage as well as in vitro and in vivo fitness. RESULTS: Distinct but partially overlapping sets of amino acids were identified that are critical to the binding of MAbs with differential neutralization profiles. We also identified possible interactions between the S1 and S2 domains of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Finally, we showed that escape from neutralization usually attenuates SARS-CoV infection. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a mechanism to overcome neutralization escape by using broadly cross reactive cocktails of cross-neutralizing MAbs that recognize residues within the receptor binding domain, critical for virus replication and virulence.","publish_time":"2010-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rockx, Barry; Donaldson, Eric; Frieman, Matthew; Sheahan, Timothy; Corti, Davide; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e59a011ddbbf94c65b86c37b90620b8a8c3c8ed2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2826557.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1086/651022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20144042/; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/201/6/946/18061591/201-6-946.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutralization escape mutations","neutralization escape mutants","binding of MAbs","SARS-Coronavirus","SARS-CoV infection","SARS-CoV S glycoprotein","differential neutralization profiles","human disease","human monoclonal antibodies","S2 domains","S1","receptor binding domain","cross reactive cocktails of cross","animal receptor usage","effect","detailed phylogenetic analysis","virus replication","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","epidemiological studies","residues","overlapping sets of amino acids","BACKGROUND","mechanism","study","majority of epitopes","major target of protective immunity","possible interactions","RESULTS","regions","virulence","data","panel","CONCLUSIONS","Spike","animals","METHODS","fitness"],"language":"en"},

Rapid diagnosis of hAdV infection is critical for appropriate and timely management. This study reports the design and validation of a sensitive and specific multiplex real\u2010time PCR for the detection of a broad range of hAdV serotypes in respiratory samples. The assay targets the conserved region of the hAdV hexon gene and utilizes hydrolysis probes for the detection of amplified products. The assay was evaluated using retrospectively (n = 864) and prospectively (n = 11,451) collected samples from November 2005 to July 2006. Seasonality studies and analysis of outbreaks was conducted over a 2\u2010year period from January 2005 to December 2006 (n = 33,067 samples). The assay gave a hAdV positive rate of 7.1% (n = 811) for specimens tested prospectively and was able to detect a broad range of hAdV serotypes with good sensitivity and specificity. A high rate of co\u2010infection was noted (21.7%). Adenovirus infections were more prevalent in the young with a median age of 24 months for positive patients. Sequence analysis of hAdV positives showed that serotype 7 was the most prevalent followed by serotypes 2 and 3. Association of hAdVs with respiratory outbreaks was low at 2.3% (6 of 266 outbreaks tested) and no seasonal variation was observed for hAdV infections during the 2\u2010year study period. This assay can improve the detection of hAdVs in respiratory samples and can be used to provide valuable epidemiological information. J. Med.

However, new technologies need to be developed to combat an emerging generation of infectious diseases. DNA vaccination has been demonstrated to have great potential for use with a wide variety of diseases. Alone, this technology does not generate a significant immune response for vaccination, but combined with delivery by electroporation (EP), can enhance plasmid expression and immunity. Most EP systems, while effective, can be invasive and painful making them less desirable for use in vaccination. Our lab recently developed a non-invasive electrode known as the multi-electrode array (MEA), which lies flat on the surface of the skin without penetrating the tissue. In this study we evaluated the MEA for its use in DNA vaccination using Hepatitis B virus as the infectious model. We utilized the guinea pig model because their skin is similar in thickness and morphology to humans. The plasmid encoding Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was delivered intradermally with the MEA to guinea pig skin. The results show increased protein expression resulting from plasmid delivery using the MEA as compared to injection alone. Within 48 hours of treatment, there was an influx of cellular infiltrate in experimental groups. Humoral responses were also increased significantly in both duration and intensity as compared to injection only groups. While this electrode requires further study, our results suggest that the MEA has potential for use in electrically mediated intradermal DNA vaccination.","publish_time":"2011-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Donate, Amy; Coppola, Domenico; Cruz, Yolmari; Heller, Richard","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3fe63ea9f4794d58f37083f3430c6e5238449c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3084774.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559474/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019181","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use","plasmid expression","mediated intradermal DNA vaccination","plasmid delivery","guinea pig skin","increased protein expression","non-invasive electrode","infectious model","increased longevity","guinea pig model","results","injection","study","Hepatitis B surface antigen","Hepatitis B virus","multi-electrode array","incidence of fatal","great potential","experimental groups","emerging generation of infectious diseases","EP systems","non-fatal infections","wide variety of diseases","development of vaccines","influx of cellular infiltrate","thickness","morphology","HBsAg","significant immune response","Current progress","humans","intensity","technology","duration","lab","electroporation","immunity","hours of treatment","new technologies","Humoral responses","tissue"],"language":"en"},

Agricultural and industrial development has resulted in the increased density of humans living in close proximity to each other. This lifestyle change from more rural existence has brought humans in closer proximity to wild animals that harbor potential future human pathogens. Most diseases are transmitted by insect vectors. Molecular diagnostic tests can be divided into two primary groups. The first are tests designed to detect the presence of mutations in the human genome that are associated with specific diseases. These tests need to be performed only once in a specific individual\u2019s lifetime. The second group of molecular diagnostic assays is designed to detect infectious agents or the recurrence of a mutation specifically associated with a tumor the patient has had in the past. Bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections can be eradicated and recur at a time in the future requiring repetition of the same molecular assay for detection. Minimal residual disease detection refers to the analysis of tissue/cells in a patient previously diagnosed with a malignancy to evaluate if therapy was completed successfully or if rare malignant cells are present.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kiechle, Frederick L.","journal":"Molecular Diagnostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5d9aa2f60b8cffc4bc5dfbf4cb50daf799dd763.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149574.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123694287000094; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123694287000094","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Molecular diagnostic tests","specific diseases","molecular assay","progression of infectious diseases","patient","group of molecular diagnostic assays","closer proximity","potential future human pathogens","human genome","close proximity","infectious agents","increased density of humans","future requiring repetition","rare malignant cells","specific individual\u2019s lifetime","Minimal residual disease detection","wild animals","pathogenesis","rural existence","analysis of tissue","chapter","industrial development","presence of mutations","parasitic infections","Publisher Summary","lifestyle change","recurrence","therapy","malignancy","tumor","insect vectors","primary groups","past"],"language":"en"},

Aims This narrative review aims to assess the potential of monoclonal antibody-based interventions for infectious diseases. Sources A review of the literature via the Medline database was performed and complemented by published official documents on licensed anti-infective mAbs. In addition, ongoing trials were identified through a search of the clinical trial registration platform ClinicalTrials.gov. Content We identified the few infections for which mAbs have been added to the therapeutic armamentarium and stressed their potential in representing a readily available protection tool against biothreats and newly emerging and reemerging infectious agents. In reviewing the historical context and main features of mAbs, we assert a potentially wider applicability and cite relevant examples of ongoing therapeutic developments. Factors hindering successful introduction of mAbs on a larger scale are outlined and thoughts are offered on how to possibly address some of these limitations. Implications mAbs may represent important tools in treating or preventing infections occurring with reasonably sufficient prevalence to justify demand and for which existing alternatives are not deemed fully adequate. Future initiatives need to address the prohibitive costs encountered in the development process. The feasibility of more large-scale administration of alternative modalities merits further exploration. In order to ensure optimal prospect of regulatory success, an early dialogue with competent authorities is encouraged.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pelfrene, E.; Mura, M.; Cavaleiro Sanches, A.; Cavaleri, M.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e2a686e17bb1e3c0180350f986c0fe9d17f7839.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128139.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X18303641; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X18303641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29715552/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2018.04.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ClinicalTrials.gov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Implications mAbs","licensed anti-infective mAbs","successful introduction of mAbs","main features of mAbs","infectious diseases arena","infectious agents","infections","paucity of licensed monoclonal antibodies","ongoing trials","therapeutic armamentarium","narrative review","potential of monoclonal antibody-based interventions","relevant examples of ongoing therapeutic developments","search","early dialogue","optimal prospect of regulatory success","clinical trial registration platform","Content","biothreats","prohibitive costs","large-scale administration of alternative modalities","ready availability","Abstract Background","larger scale","available protection tool","demand","therapeutics","use","literature","wider applicability","historical context","important tools","official documents","competent authorities","existing alternatives","development process","feasibility","exploration","order","sufficient prevalence","Factors","Future initiatives","Medline database","conditions","thoughts","Sources","addition","limitations"],"language":"en"},

Since then, PDCoV has subsequently been reported worldwide, causing a high number of neonatal piglet deaths and significant economic losses to the swine industry. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a highly sensitive and specific method for the rapid diagnosis of PDCoV. RESULTS: In the present study, a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method using recombinase polymerase amplification combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD-RPA) was developed for rapid and visual detection of PDCoV. The system can be performed under a broad range of temperature conditions from 10 to 37 \u00B0C, and the detection of PDCoV can be completed in 10 min at 37 \u00B0C. The sensitivity of this assay was 10 times higher than that of conventional PCR with a lower detection limit of 1 \u00D7 10(2) copies/\u00B5l of PDCoV. Meanwhile, the LFD-RPA assay specifically amplified PDCoV, while there was no cross-amplification with other swine-associated viruses, including Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and Seneca valley virus (SVV). The repeatability of the test results indicated that this assay had good repeatability. In addition, 68 clinical samples (48 fecal swab specimens and 20 intestinal specimens) were further tested by LFD-RPA and RT-PCR assay.

Hexa-histidine is one of the most commonly used fusion tags for protein expression due to its small size and convenient purification via immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). This purification process has been adapted to the protein microarray format, but the quality of in situ His-tagged protein purification on slides has not been systematically evaluated. We established methods to determine the level of purification of such proteins on metal chelate-modified slide surfaces. Optimized in situ purification of His-tagged recombinant proteins has the potential to become the new gold standard for cost-effective generation of high-quality and high-density protein microarrays. RESULTS: Two slide surfaces were examined, chelated Cu(2\u002B )slides suspended on a polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating and chelated Ni(2\u002B )slides immobilized on a support without PEG coating. Using PEG-coated chelated Cu(2\u002B )slides, consistently higher purities of recombinant proteins were measured. An optimized wash buffer (PBST) composed of 10 mM phosphate buffer, 2.7 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4, further improved protein purity levels. Using Escherichia coli cell lysates expressing 90 recombinant Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins, 73 proteins were successfully immobilized, and 66 proteins were in situ purified with greater than 90% purity. We identified several antigens among the in situ-purified proteins via assays with anti-S. pneumoniae rabbit antibodies and a human patient antiserum, as a demonstration project of large scale microarray-based immunoproteomics profiling. The methodology is compatible with higher throughput formats of in vivo protein expression, eliminates the need for resin-based purification and circumvents protein solubility and denaturation problems caused by buffer exchange steps and freeze-thaw cycles, which are associated with resin-based purification, intermittent protein storage and deposition on microarrays. CONCLUSION: An optimized platform for in situ protein purification on microarray slides using His-tagged recombinant proteins is a desirable tool for the screening of novel protein functions and protein-protein interactions. In the context of immunoproteomics, such protein microarrays are complimentary to approaches using non-recombinant methods to discover and characterize bacterial antigens.","publish_time":"2009-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwon, Keehwan; Grose, Carissa; Pieper, Rembert; Pandya, Gagan A; Fleischmann, Robert D; Peterson, Scott N","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a8339ac2c0891d5113f221ebd214f2b1d903d38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2746808.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19698181/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6750-9-72","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein-protein interactions","situ protein purification","protein solubility","protein microarray technologies","protein microarray format","high-density protein microarrays","situ purification","intermittent protein storage","high throughput protein expression","screening of novel protein functions","discovery of novel protein functions","improved protein purity levels","convenient purification","microarray slides","level of purification","purification process","resin-based purification","recombinant Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins","higher purities of recombinant proteins","non-recombinant methods","chelated Cu","PEG coating","optimized wash buffer","chelated Ni","phosphate buffer","optimized platform","demonstration project of large scale microarray-based immunoproteomics profiling","higher throughput formats of","buffer exchange steps","modified slide surfaces","immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography","context of immunoproteomics","bacterial antigens","pneumoniae rabbit antibodies","screening of therapeutic reagents","cost-effective generation of high-quality","human patient antiserum","denaturation problems","small size","postgenomic era","assays","new gold standard","Escherichia coli cell lysates","desirable tool","freeze-thaw cycles","IMAC","potential","deposition","need","polyethylene glycol","methodology","PBST","KCl","fusion tags","support","NaCl","Tween","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","Hexa-histidine"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiologic characteristics of KD, including the strict predilection of age in all ethnic groups and the gradually increased incidence after the KD emergence, suggest that KD is affected by the immune maturation in early childhood that may be determined by genetic factors, and KD is also affected by the changed environmental circumstances such as improved public hygiene. We postulated that the pathogenesis of KD is a hyperimmune reaction in genetically susceptible children to the variants of normal flora, which are induced by the environmental factors.

Analysis by hybridization kinetics of the annealing between A59 [32P]cDNA and infected cell RNA from the other four MHV strains demonstrated 70\u201380% homology. By gel transfer analysis, the A59 [32P]cDNA was able to detect subgenomic-size virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with all of the five MHV strains. A similar pattern of seven viral RNAs was detected in cells infected with A59, MHV-1, MHV-3, and JHM. In contrast, cells infected with MHV-S contained seven virus-specific RNAs, of which only the two smallest species comigrated with RNAs from the other four strains. The results suggest that as previously shown with A59 (S. Cheley, R. Anderson, M. J. Cupples, E. C. M. Lee Chan, and V. L. Morris (1981) Virology, 112, 596\u2013604), all MHV strains tested encode a nested set of subgenomic RNAs. Analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled viral proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that each strain of MHV specified four major viral polypeptides with apparent molecular weights very similar to those previously reported for the E2, N, El, and PEI polypeptides of A59. The strong degree of interstrain homology among the five MHV strains investigated was confirmed by comparative chymotryptic peptide mapping of the viral N proteins. A majority of the chymotryptic peptides from each of the [35Sknethionine-labeled N proteins was found to coelute by high-performance liquid chromotography. Moreover, this technique of peptide mapping indicated a particularly strong relatedness between MHV-1 and MHV-S and among MHV-3, JHM, and A59.","publish_time":"1981-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheley, Steve; Morris, Vincent L.; Cupples, Margaret J.; Anderson, Robert","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6058e813e7b4c4f5c57eba44da2463bd5774574b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682281901136; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682281901136","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["R.

Results Of the 2299 patients with specimens tested during the study period, 427 (18.6%) were singly positive for HRV/EV and 202 (8.8%) for influenza virus (p \u003C0.01). Children with HRV/EV were more likely to present with increased work of breathing (67.9% vs. 52.5%, p \u003C0.01) with crackles (36.3% vs. 23.3%, p \u003C0.01) and wheezing (41.7% vs. 22.8%, p \u003C0.01) noted on exam. Children hospitalized with HRV/EV had a shorter median length of stay (2 days vs. 3 days, p \u003C0.01), duration of fever (1 days vs. 3 days, p \u003C0.01), and duration of hypoxemia (2 days vs. 3 days, p \u003C0.01) than children with influenza virus. Similar percentages of children with HRV/EV and influenza virus were admitted to the PICU and required positive pressure ventilation. There were no deaths in children hospitalized with HRV/EV, whereas 6 children with influenza virus expired. Conclusions HRV/EVs are common pathogens in hospitalized children associated with serious lower respiratory tract disease and significant morbidity, similar to influenza viruses.","publish_time":"2013-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Messacar, Kevin; Robinson, Christine C.; Bagdure, Dayanand; Curtis, Donna J.; Glod\u00E9, Mary P.; Dominguez, Samuel R.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/307086e56bceb563a42fe450aded2c2326d763e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3529827.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2012.09.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23078869/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653212003599; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653212003599","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV/EV","PICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospitalized children","days","influenza viruses","Conclusions HRV","Similar percentages of children","clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients","respiratory viruses","specimens positive","Study design Respiratory specimens","retrospective study","study period","positive pressure ventilation","duration of fever","duration of hypoxemia","serious lower respiratory tract disease","retrospective chart review","significant morbidity","epidemiology","viral co-infection","relative impact of human rhino","common pathogens","enteroviruses","EVs","Children\u0027s Hospital Colorado Virology Laboratory","Aurora","shorter median length of stay","PICU","Abstract Background","commercial multiplex PCR","Objectives","subtypes","increased work of breathing","Results","deaths","crackles","wheezing","exam"],"language":"en"},

The global burden of numerous infectious diseases has been significantly reduced, and in some cases, effectively eradicated through the deployment of specific vaccines. However, efforts to develop effective new vaccines against infectious pathogens such as influenza, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ebola virus, and Zika virus (ZIKV) have proven challenging. Zika virus is a mosquito-vectored flavivirus responsible for periodic outbreaks of disease in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands dating back over 50 years. Over this period, ZIKV infections were subclinical in most infected individuals and resulted in mild cases of fever, arthralgia, and rash in others. Concerns about ZIKV changed over the past two years, however, as outbreaks in Brazil, Central American countries, and Caribbean islands revealed novel aspects of infection including vertical and sexual transmission modes. Cases have been reported showing dramatic neurological pathologies including microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental problems in babies born to ZIKV infected mothers, as well as an increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. These findings prompted the World Health Organization to declare ZIKV a public health emergency in 2016, which resulted in expanded efforts to develop ZIKV vaccines and immunotherapeutics. Several ZIKV vaccine candidates that are immunogenic and effective at blocking ZIKV infection in animal models have since been developed, with some of these now being evaluated in the clinic. Additional therapeutics under investigation include anti-ZIKV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been shown to neutralize infection in vitro as well as protect against morbidity in mouse models of ZIKV infection. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of ZIKV biology and describe our efforts to rapidly develop a vaccine against ZIKV.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kudchodkar, Sagar B.; Choi, Hyeree; Reuschel, Emma L.; Esquivel, Rianne; Jin-Ah Kwon, Jackie; Jeong, Moonsup; Maslow, Joel N.; Reed, Charles C.; White, Scott; Kim, J.

Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from each case and sent for viral detection by tissue culture, antigen test, and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A total of 120 viruses were detected from 113 children. Positive viral etiology was identified in 86 (76%) children. Mixed viral pathogens were found in 28 cases (25%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common pathogen and was identified in 43.4% of the cases. Human bocavirus (hBoV) was the second most common identified virus (in 19.5%), followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus, influenza viruses, and coronavirus OC43.

However, bacteria, fungi, and parasites are less likely to cause widespread human pandemics at this point in history and are less amenable to vaccine strategies than viral diseases. Focusing on viruses, a catalog of newly discovered human pathogens from the beginning of the 20th century shows a predictable and nearly linear rate of new agents discovered over time.

The 7382-nucleotide-long genome sequence was determined by next-generation sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq System.

We investigated the presence of short-lived relative cross-protection conferred by specific prior viral infections against subsequent febrile respiratory illness (FRI). METHODS: Men enlisted in basic military training between December 2009 and December 2014 were recruited, with the first FRI as the study entry point. ResPlex II assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect viral pathogens in nasal wash samples, and survival analyses were performed to determine whether infection with particular viruses conferred short-lived relative cross-protection against FRI. RESULTS: Prior infection with adenovirus (hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], .14\u2013.44) or influenza virus (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, .38\u2013.73) conferred relative protection against subsequent FRI episode. Results were statistically significant even after adjustment for the interval between enlistment and FRI (P \u003C .001). Adenovirus-positive participants with FRI episodes tended to be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and influenza virus (P = .062\u2013.093), while men with influenza virus\u2013positive FRI episodes tended be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus (P = .044) and influenza virus (P = .081).

The preparation and purification of native viral antigens in conventional cell-based protein expression systems are often accompanied by technical hardships. These challenges are attributable mainly to protein aggregation and insolubility during expression and purification, as well as to very low expression levels associated with the toxicity of some viral proteins. Here, we describe a novel approach for the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against nucleocapsid protein (NP) of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Using a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system, we successfully prepared large amounts of MERS-CoV NP antigen in a state that was highly soluble and intact for immunization. Following mouse immunization and hybridoma generation, we selected seven hybridoma clones that produced mAbs with exclusive reactivity against MERS-CoV NP. Epitope mapping and subsequent bioinformatic analysis revealed that these mAbs recognized epitopes located within relatively highly conserved regions of the MERS-CoV amino-acid sequence. Consistently, the mAbs exhibited no obvious cross-reactivity with NPs derived from other related viruses, including SARS coronavirus. After determining the optimal combinations of these mAbs, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a rapid immunochromatographic antigen detection test that can be reliably used for laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV. Thus, this study provides strong evidence that the wheat germ cell-free system is useful for the production of diagnostic mAbs against emerging pathogens.","publish_time":"2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamaoka, Yutaro; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Matsunaga, Satoko; Matsushima, Yuki; Kuroyama, Hiroyuki; Kimura, Hirokazu; Takeda, Makoto; Chimuro, Tomoyuki; Ryo, Akihide","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b2b4954a960745a09009e9de6d1cb87358bfa6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4837155.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27148198/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP","SARS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV NP","CoV NP antigen","protein aggregation","production of diagnostic mAbs","nucleocapsid protein","Protein nativity","MERS-CoV amino-acid sequence","wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system","conventional cell-based protein expression systems","large amounts of MERS","laboratory diagnosis of MERS","wheat germ cell-free system","purification of native viral antigens","production of monoclonal antibodies","low expression levels","exclusive reactivity","quality of antigens","hybridoma generation","hybridoma clones","SARS coronavirus","viral proteins","resultant antibodies","mouse immunization","obvious cross-reactivity","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","rapid immunochromatographic antigen detection test","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","subsequent bioinformatic analysis","NPs","toxicity","strong evidence","insolubility","related viruses","conserved regions","Epitope mapping","immunogens","reactivities","epitopes","preparation","emerging pathogens","state","critical factors","novel approach","study","challenges","technical hardships","optimal combinations"],"language":"en"},

Essentially, there are two ways of expressing an exogenous protein: the creation of transgenic plants possessing a stably integrated gene construction, or the transient expression of the desired gene following the infiltration of the gene construct. Both depend on disarmed strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to deliver the created gene construction into cell nuclei, usually through the deployment of virus\u2010derived components. The importance of efficient mRNA translation in the latter process is highlighted. Plant viruses replicate to sustain an infection to promote their survival. The major product of this, the virus particle, is finding increasing roles in the emerging field of bionanotechnology. One of the major products of plant\u2010viral expression is the virus\u2010like particle (VLP). These are increasingly playing a role in vaccine development. Similarly, many VLPs are suitable for the investigation of the many facets of the emerging field of synthetic biology, which encompasses the design and construction of new biological functions and systems not found in nature.

Since then, large-scale sporadic outbreaks of PED caused by PEDV variants have occasionally occurred in China. However, the molecular diversity and epidemiology of PEDV in different provinces has not been completely understood. To determine the molecular diversity of PEDV in the Hubei Province of China, we collected 172 PED samples from 34 farms across the province in 2016 and performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene. Seventy-four samples were found to be PEDV-positive. We further characterized the complete spike (S) glycoprotein genes from the positive samples and found 21 different S genes with amino acid mutations. The PEDV isolates here presented most of the genotypes which were found previously in field isolates in East and South-East Asia, North America, and Europe. Besides the typical Genotypes I and II, the INDEX groups were also found. Importantly, 58 new amino acids mutant sites in the S genes, including 44 sites in S1 and 14 sites in S2, were first described. Our results revealed that the S genes of PEDV showed variation and that diverse genotypes of PEDV coexisted and were responsible for the PED outbreaks in Hubei in 2016. This work highlighted the complexity of the epidemiology of PEDV and emphasized the need for reassessing the efficacy of classic PEDV vaccines against emerging variant strains and developing new vaccines to facilitate the prevention and control of PEDV in fields.

We collected information on swine flu knowledge, perception on immunization safety, perceived efficacy of recommended behavior, changed behavior, and anxiety. RESULTS: Of the 236 respondents, 83.1% had some anxiety about swine flu, 64.8% believed avoiding crowded places was preventive, 33.5% believed the 2009 swine flu vaccine was safe, and 36.9% showed interest in receiving the vaccine. Misconceptions about swine flu contagion via eating cooked pork, water sources, and insect bites were common. Respondents were unaware of transmissions via contaminated objects and droplets. Only 42.6% were satisfied with governmental efforts. Women were more likely to wash hands frequently than men (odds ratio 2.80, p \u003C 0.001).

The usefulness of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein as indicators of the presence or absence of viral infection in this setting also needs to be evaluated. Methods The study was of a prospective cohort of patients with COPD admitted to the ED for AECOPD. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 14 respiratory viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected at admission and after recovery in stable condition. Results Eighty-six patients (mean age, 72 years; male, 64%) were included. During AECOPD, upper-respiratory viral infections were detected in 44 (51%) patients: picornavirus in 22, metapneumovirus in seven, coronavirus in eight, influenza A/B in two, parainfluenza in two, and respiratory syncytial virus in three. A dual infection was present in three patients. After recovery, viruses were detected in only eight (11%) of 71 patients (P \u003C .001 compared with AECOPD phase). In five of these patients, no virus had been identified during the initial exacerbation, thus suggesting a new viral infection acquired during follow-up. During AECOPD, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels did not differ significantly between patients with or without a proven viral infection. Conclusions Prevalence of upper-respiratory viral infection, as detected from nasopharyngeal swab by RT-PCR, is high in AECOPD and low after clinical recovery, suggesting that AECOPD frequently are triggered by viral infections initiated in the upper-respiratory tract.

Given the wide range of symptoms, emergency physicians must maintain a broad differential diagnosis in the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with influenza-like illnesses. OBJECTIVE: This review addresses objective and subjective symptoms commonly associated with influenza and discusses important mimics of influenza viruses, while offering a practical approach to their clinical evaluation and treatment. DISCUSSION: Influenza-like symptoms are common in the emergency department (ED), and influenza accounts for \u003E 200,000 hospitalizations annually. The three predominant types are A, B, and C, and these viruses are commonly transmitted through aerosolized viral particles with a wide range of symptoms. The most reliable means of identifying influenza in the ED is rapid antigen detection, although consideration of local prevalence is required. High-risk populations include children younger than 4 years, adults older than 50 years, adults with immunosuppression or chronic comorbidities, pregnancy, obesity, residents of long-term care facilities, and several others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors in these populations. However, up to 70% of patients with these symptoms may have a mimic. These mimics include infectious and noninfectious sources. The emergency physician must be aware of life-threatening mimics and assess for these conditions while beginning resuscitation and treatment.

A variable region, including a 15 nucleotide deletion unique to MHV-RI, could be identified at the 5\u0027-terminus of the gene. This region of the M protein may be immunogenic and may contribute to the antigenic diversity of the MHV strains. Sequence relationships between the strains showed no correspondence with the primary cell tropism. This may suggest that evolution of enterotropism was not a single occurrence among different MHV strains. No sequence unique to either tropism group could be identified, indicating that the M protein of MHV probably has no part in the determination of MHV tissue tropism.","publish_time":"1994-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hornberger, F.

A promising target for both diagnosis and therapeutics treatments of the new disease named COVID-19 is the coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein.

We also calculated free energy of interactions and shown that the S RBD proteins from both SARS viruses binds to ACE2 with similar affinities. However, the affinity between the S RBD protein from the new SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complexed with SARS-CoV-1. Based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates, we can shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes, their clinical aspects, the implications for drug developments, and suggest structural modifications on the CR3022 antibody that would improve its binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to address the ongoing international health crisis.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giron, Carolina Corr\u00EAa; Laaksonen, Aatto; da Silva, Fernando L.

The objective of this study was to investigate the causes of uveitis in cats diagnosed at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bucharest between 2012 and 2015. Medical records were reviewed and cats were considered if complete diagnostic work-up, clinical examination and imaging studies were performed. All the feline cases were serologically tested for at least two of the common infectious causes: feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella spp. Ninety-six cats with a mean age of 5.42 years, ranging from 1 month to 17 years old, with a male to female ratio of 1.33/1 were diagnosed with uveitis. The European domestic cat was overrepresented at 76% followed by Birman cat (6.3%), Persian cat (4.2%), Russian blue (4.2%), Norwegian cat (2%), British Short Hair (1%), Sphynx (1%) and Cornish Rex (1%). Infectious diseases were the cause of uveitis in 31 cases (32.3%), neoplasia was diagnosed in 22 cases (22.9%), uveitis secondary to septic keratitis in 8 cases (8.3%) and uveitis secondary to direct ocular trauma in 6 cases (6.3%). Twenty-nine cats (30.2%) with a mean age of 4.33 years old were diagnosed with idiopathic or immune-mediated uveitis, less than previously reported. Aqueous flare occurred in 91 cats and keratic precipitates were noted in 39 cats. The most common infectious cause of uveitis in this study was Toxoplasma gondii (n=18). Infectious diseases remain the most common cause of feline uveitis, therefore systemic evaluation and serological investigations should be performed in all cats with uveitis, cataract and glaucoma.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Enache, Andra; Iona\u015Fcu, Iuliana; \u015Eonea, Alexandru; Cuco\u015F, Anca","journal":"Agriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221078431630273X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221078431630273X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bartonella"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bucharest"],"keyphrases":["cats","uveitis secondary","common cause of feline uveitis","causes of uveitis","feline cases","common infectious cause of uveitis","Abstract Uveitis","immune-mediated uveitis","feline coronavirus","feline patients","common infectious causes","feline immunodeficiency virus","feline leukemia virus","common cause of blindness","Infectious diseases","secondary glaucoma","years old","Norwegian cat","Birman cat","Persian cat","Toxoplasma gondii","study","mean age","European domestic cat","pupillary block","formation of pre-iridal fibrovascular membranes","clinical examination","systemic evaluation","Bartonella","direct ocular trauma","complete diagnostic work","Faculty of Veterinary Medicine","serological investigations","septic keratitis","keratic precipitates","Bucharest","imaging studies","chronicization","female ratio","month","cataract","British Short Hair","Aqueous flare","Sphynx","Russian blue","Medical records","neoplasia","Cornish Rex","objective"],"language":"en"},

While successful respiratory viruses overcome individual ISG effectors, analysis of the global ISG response and subsequent viral antagonism has yet to be examined. Employing models of the human airway, transcriptomics and proteomics datasets were used to compare ISG response patterns following highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (HPAI) A virus, 2009 pandemic H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) infection. The results illustrated distinct approaches utilized by each virus to antagonize the global ISG response. In addition, the data revealed that highly virulent HPAI virus and MERS-CoV induce repressive histone modifications, which downregulate expression of ISG subsets. Notably, influenza A virus NS1 appears to play a central role in this histone-mediated downregulation in highly pathogenic influenza strains. Together, the work demonstrates the existence of unique and common viral strategies for controlling the global ISG response and provides a novel avenue for viral antagonism via altered histone modifications.","publish_time":"2014-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menachery, Vineet D.; Eisfeld, Amie J.; Sch\u00E4fer, Alexandra; Josset, Laurence; Sims, Amy C.; Proll, Sean; Fan, Shufang; Li, Chengjun; Neumann, Gabriele; Tilton, Susan C.; Chang, Jean; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Long, Casey; Green, Richard; Williams, Christopher M.; Weiss, Jeffrey; Matzke, Melissa M.; Webb-Robertson, Bobbie-Jo; Schepmoes, Athena A.; Shukla, Anil K.; Metz, Thomas O.; Smith, Richard D.; Waters, Katrina M.; Katze, Michael G.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fef0bb9eaac69559d0ff2f92ff83e0affd4435f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4030454.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01174-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24846384/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISG"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["global ISG response","ISG response patterns","MERS-CoV","individual ISG effectors","expression of ISG subsets","SARS-CoV","virus NS1","viral pathogenesis","virulent HPAI virus","subsequent viral antagonism","Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV","common viral strategies","altered histone modifications","repressive histone modifications","pathogenic influenza strains","pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza","successful respiratory viruses","histone-mediated downregulation","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","pandemic H1N1","analysis","novel avenue","diversity of interferon","stimulated genes","proteomics datasets","function","human airway","transcriptomics","ISGs","existence of unique","central role","antiviral state","host","broad range","models","distinct approaches","infection","results","work","addition"],"language":"en"},

PDCoV is a highly contagious infectious disease characterized by diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting. It has been reported that lncRNA has a significant effect on viral replication and increased or decreased virulence. At present, there is almost no research on lncRNA related to PDCoV infection. With the development of the research, a large number of lncRNAs related to PDCoV infection have been discovered. Identifying the role of these lncRNAs in the infection process facilitates the screening of diagnostically significant biomarkers. RESULTS: Using high throughput sequencing to screen differentially expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) during PDCoV infection, we identified 99, 41 and 33 differentially expressed lncRNAs in the early, middle and late stages of infection, respectively. These lncRNAs were involved in glycolysis / gluconeogenesis, histidine metabolism and pentose and Chloroalkane and chloroalkene degradation pathway. We obtained expression data of miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs during PDCoV infection and constructed and investigated an interaction network. The qRT-PCR validation results of 6 differentially expressed lncRNAs were consistent with RNA-Seq results. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to examine differentially expressed lncRNAs after PDCoV infection of piglets. These results can provide new insights into PDCoV infection and antiviral strategies.

Increased understanding of biology and pathogenesis of WNV together with recent technological advancements have raised hope that an effective WNV vaccine may be available in the near future. In addition, rapid progress in the structural and functional characterization of WNV and other flaviviral proteins have provided a solid base for the design and development of several classes of inhibitors as potential WNV therapeutics. Moreover, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies demonstrate an excellent efficacy against WNV in animal models and represent a promising class of WNV therapeutics.

Data are limited on the duration and host factors related to viral shedding. METHODS: In this retrospective study, risk factors associated with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA shedding were evaluated in a cohort of 113 symptomatic patients from two hospitals outside Wuhan. RESULTS: The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 17 days (Interquartile Range [IQR], 13\u201322 days) as measured from illness onset. When comparing patients with early (\u003C15 days) and late viral RNA clearance (\u226515 days after illness onset), prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was associated with male sex (p=0.009), old age (p=0.033), concomitated with hypertension (p=0.009), delayed admission to hospital after illness onset (p=0.001), severe illness at admission (p=0.049), invasive mechanical ventilation (p=0.006), and corticosteroid treatment (p=0.025). Patients with longer SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding duration had slower recovery of body temperature (p\u003C0.001) and focal absorption on radiograph images (p\u003C0.001) than patients with early SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance.

In particular, this study pays attention to formulating a mathematical model for MERS transmission dynamics and estimating transmission rates. METHODS: Incidence data of MERS-CoV from the government authority was analyzed for the first aim and a mathematical model was built and analyzed for the second aim of the study. A mathematical model for MERS-CoV transmission dynamics is used to estimate the transmission rates in two periods due to the implementation of intensive interventions. RESULTS: Using the estimates of the transmission rates, the basic reproduction number was estimated in two periods. Due to the superspreader, the basic reproduction number was very large in the first period; however, the basic reproduction number of the second period has reduced significantly after intensive interventions. CONCLUSION: It turned out to be the intensive isolation and quarantine interventions that were the most critical factors that prevented the spread of the MERS outbreak. The results are expected to be useful to devise more efficient intervention strategies in the future.","publish_time":"2016-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yunhwan; Lee, Sunmi; Chu, Chaeshin; Choe, Seoyun; Hong, Saeme; Shin, Youngseo","journal":"Osong Public Health Res Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/335dbf8f43a8eca80f3e2730b3f8a1e655ca2d14.json; document_parses/pdf_json/03ad1cf472c9636fceb1b800c553fde73724e349.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4776270.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26981343/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210909915301004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210909915301004; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrp.2016.01.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle Eastern","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["MERS transmission dynamics","transmission rates","MERS-CoV transmission dynamics","MERS outbreak","basic reproduction number","mathematical model","Incidence data of MERS","implementation of intensive interventions","quarantine interventions","periods","intensive isolation","study","aim","RESULTS","outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus","efficient intervention strategies","attention","major events","critical factors","government authority","South Korea","future","OBJECTIVES","METHODS","estimates","superspreader","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

A pathogen discovery protocol was applied in undiagnosed pleural effusion samples and led to the identification of three new isolates of TTMV (TTMV-LY). Isolated TTMV-LY genomes were transfected into A549 and human embryonic kidney 293T cells and viral replication was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and full-length genome amplification. A549 cells were further infected with released TTMV-LY virions and the induced-innate immune response was measured by multiplex immunoassays. Genetic analyses of the three TTMV-LY genomes revealed a classic genomic organisation but a weak identity (\u003C64%) with known sequences. We demonstrated the in vitro replication of TTMV-LY in alveolar epithelial cells and the effective release of infectious viral particles. We also showed a selective production of inflammatory mediators in response to TTMV infection.

Before challenge and on each of 6 days of cloister, all volunteers were interviewed for symptoms and completed a test battery consisting of evaluations of secretion production by weighed tissues, nasal patency by active posterior rhinomanometry, nasal clearance by the dyed saccharin technique, pulmonary function by spirometry, eustachian tube function by sonotubometry, and middle ear status by tympanometry. The symptomatology and pathophysiology resulting from the rhinovirus infection were consistent with those reported in previous studies with this challenge system. Between-group comparisons revealed no differences in symptom presentation, nasal secretion production, or overall pathophysiologic response. However, for decreased mucociliary clearance rate, increased nasal congestion, eustachian tube dysfunction, and symptoms of sneezing, the allergic group demonstrated an earlier onset compared with that of the nonallergic group. The biologic significance of the differences in onset of dysfunction is tempered by the observation that the temporal pattern of responses in the allergic group was similar with that of nonallergic subjects in previous studies.

Needed also are more public health professionals skilled in non-communicable disease surveillance and interventions. As a result, we surveyed all 57 field epidemiology training programmes (FETPs) that are members of the Training Program in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET), to evaluate the progress of the FETPs, the only global applied epidemiology network, toward increasing public health capacity globally. METHODS: Data on the FETP programmes and the training they provide were abstracted from TEPHINET membership surveys and verified with FETP directors for all FETPs that were members of TEPHINET in 2012. Data on abstracts submitted to the recent TEPHINET Global Scientific Conference, on recent accomplishments by each FETP, and on quality improvement were also compiled to provide a worldwide view of the public health human resource capacity produced by these programmes. RESULTS: A total of 6980 public health professionals worldwide have graduated from an FETP or from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Epidemiology Intelligence Service (EIS). FETP residents and graduates participate in key public health prevention, control, and response activities. Each FETP has adapted its curriculum and objectives over time to align with its country\u2019s public health priorities. FETPs are well integrated into their national public health infrastructures, and they have many partners at the national, regional and global levels. CONCLUSION: FETPs are a competent and diverse source of highly skilled public health professionals who contribute significantly to public health\u2019s global human resource needs. This finding is evidenced by 1) the training curricula that were adapted over time to meet public health\u2019s human resource needs, 2) the FETPs\u2019 continued support from internal and external partners, 3) the increasing number of FETP residents and graduates and their increasing contribution to effective public health work, and 4) the increased quality improvement initiatives facilitated through the FETPs membership in one global network, TEPHINET.","publish_time":"2013-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Subramanian, Renee E; Herrera, Dionisio G; Kelly, Paul M","journal":"Hum Resour Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a986a6d115df1e271c89a765800aa931ac3f6833.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3849587.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-4491-11-45; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24053689/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Public Health Interventions Network","FETP","TEPHINET Global Scientific Conference","Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Epidemiology Intelligence Service"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health capacity","skilled public health professionals","Public Health Interventions Network","national public health infrastructures","number of public health professionals skilled","key public health prevention","effective public health work","country\u2019s public health priorities","public health human resource capacity","FETP programmes","public health\u2019s global human resource needs","public health\u2019s human resource needs","FETPs membership","global network","FETP directors","increasing number of FETP residents","members of TEPHINET","global applied epidemiology network","field epidemiology training programmes","global levels","recent TEPHINET Global Scientific Conference","TEPHINET membership surveys","training curricula","Disease Control","graduates","increasing contribution","time","Data","worldwide view","Prevention\u2019s Epidemiology Intelligence Service","recent accomplishments","external partners","infectious epidemics","infectious diseases","increased quality improvement initiatives","non-communicable disease surveillance","diverse source","continued support","Center","EIS","abstracts","total","response activities","borders","curriculum","objectives","METHODS","species","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","progress","finding"],"language":"en"},

Most factors influencing prognosis are not mutually exclusive, are interrelated (i.e., cofactors), and often represent gene-environment interactions. Many of these risk factors have been, and continue to be, investigated in prospective studies in order to decipher their relative importance with the goal of developing new therapies and interventions in the future.

Hence, even suspected HID cases should be managed in specialised facilities minimizing infection risks but allowing state-of-the-art critical care. Consensus statements on the operational management of isolation facilities have been published recently. The study presented was set up to compare the operational management, resources, and technical equipment among European isolation facilities. Due to differences in geography, population density, and national response plans it was hypothesized that adherence to recommendations will vary. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Until mid of 2010 the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases conducted a cross-sectional analysis of isolation facilities in Europe, recruiting 48 isolation facilities in 16 countries. Three checklists were disseminated, assessing 44 items and 148 specific questions. The median feedback rate for specific questions was 97.9% (n = 47/48) (range: n = 7/48 (14.6%) to n = 48/48 (100%). Although all facilities enrolled were nominated specialised facilities\u0027 serving countries or regions, their design, equipment and personnel management varied. Eighteen facilities fulfilled the definition of a High Level Isolation Unit\u0027. In contrast, 24 facilities could not operate independently from their co-located hospital, and five could not ensure access to equipment essential for infection control. Data presented are not representative for the EU in general, as only 16/27 (59.3%) of all Member States agreed to participate. Another limitation of this study is the time elapsed between data collection and publication; e.g. in Germany one additional facility opened in the meantime. CONCLUSION: There are disparities both within and between European countries regarding the design and equipment of isolation facilities. With regard to the International Health Regulations, terminology, capacities and equipment should be standardised.","publish_time":"2014-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schilling, Stefan; Fusco, Francesco Maria; De Iaco, Giuseppina; Bannister, Barbara; Maltezou, Helena C.; Carson, Gail; Gottschalk, Rene; Brodt, Hans-Reinhard; Brouqui, Philippe; Puro, Vincenzo; Ippolito, Giuseppe","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60a7721ab454f05f6622087ecde3b186b505779f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4211666.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0100401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25350843/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Network","EU"],"locations":["Europe","Germany"],"keyphrases":["equipment of isolation facilities","European isolation facilities","operational management of isolation facilities","cross-sectional analysis of isolation facilities","technical equipment","equipment essential","European countries","personnel management","High Level Isolation Unit","design","Infectious Diseases","European Network","specific questions","study","infection risks","infection control","specialised facilities\u0027","data collection","transmissible form person","International Health Regulations","population density","publication","terminology","capacities","definition","regions","resources","state-of-the-art critical care","Germany","national response","geography","median feedback rate","access","additional facility","Consensus statements","differences","regard","suspected HID cases","items","BACKGROUND","HIDs","disparities","life-threatening illness","treatment options","co-located hospital","adherence","METHODS","FINDINGS","meantime","limitation","range","Member States","recommendations","checklists","CONCLUSION","contrast"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We enrolled 53 infants with pertussis younger than 180 days (median age 58 days, range 17\u2013109 days, 64.1% boys), hospitalized in the Pediatric Departments at \u201CSapienza\u201D University Rome and Bambino Ges\u00F9 Children\u2019s Hospital from August 2012 to November 2014. We tested in naso-pharyngeal washings B. pertussis and 14 respiratory viruses with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were obtained from hospital records and demographic characteristics collected using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: 28/53 infants had B. pertussis alone and 25 viral coinfection: 10 human rhinovirus (9 alone and 1 in coinfection with parainfluenza virus), 3 human coronavirus, 2 respiratory syncytial virus. No differences were observed in clinical disease severity between infants with B. pertussis infection alone and those with coinfections.

It is possible that PRV-associated respiratory infections might be prevalent in Southeast Asia. The clinical course of PRV is not fully elucidated. METHODS: The virulence, pathology, and pathogenesis of two PRV strains, a human-borne PRV strain (isolated from a patient, who returned to Japan from Bali, Indonesia in 2007) and a bat-borne PRV (isolated from a bat [Eonycteris spelaea] in the Philippines in 2013) were investigated in BALB/c mice using virological, pathological, and immunological study methods. RESULTS: The intranasal inoculation of BALB/c mice with human-borne PRV caused respiratory infection. In addition, all mice with immunity induced by pre-inoculation with a non-lethal dose of PRV were completely protected against lethal PRV infection. Mice treated with antiserum with neutralizing antibody activity after inoculation with a lethal dose of PRV showed a reduced fatality rate. In this mouse model, bat-borne PRV caused respiratory infection similar to human-borne PRV. PRV caused lethal respiratory disease in an animal model of PRV infection, in which BALB/c mice were used. CONCLUSIONS: The BALB/c mouse model might help to accelerate research on the virulence of PRV and be useful for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic agents and vaccines for the treatment and prevention of PRV infection. PRV was shown for the first time to be a causative virus of respiratory disease on the basis of Koch\u2019s postulations by the additional demonstration that PRV caused respiratory disease in mice through their intranasal inoculation with PRV.","publish_time":"2017-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Egawa, Kazutaka; Shimojima, Masayuki; Taniguchi, Satoshi; Nagata, Noriyo; Tani, Hideki; Yoshikawa, Tomoki; Kurosu, Takeshi; Watanabe, Shumpei; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Saijo, Masayuki","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc502e4494d5ef1e5a2f54b5df88e7c391d9a763.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5730109.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29240753/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRV"],"locations":["Southeast Asia","Japan","Bali","Indonesia","Philippines"],"keyphrases":["virulence of PRV","PRV strains","lethal PRV infection","prevention of PRV infection","animal model of PRV infection","clinical course of PRV","non-lethal dose of PRV","c mice","lethal respiratory disease","respiratory infection similar","respiratory infections","intranasal inoculation of BALB","Cases of acute respiratory tract infection","causative virus of respiratory disease","c mouse model","pre-inoculation","Southeast Asia","Pteropine orthoreovirus","genus Orthoreovirus","immunological study methods","additional demonstration","basis of Koch\u2019s postulations","treatment","neutralizing antibody activity","vaccines","antiserum","efficacy of therapeutic agents","Reoviridae","BACKGROUND","Eonycteris spelaea","pathogenesis","immunity","reduced fatality rate","patient","pathology","research","Japan","family","Indonesia","time","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","Bali","Philippines","humans","bats"],"language":"en"},

Those national laws and regulations directly affect bedside availability of Internationally Controlled Essential Medicines (ICEMs). The complex interaction between national regulatory systems and global supply chains (now impacted by COVID-19 pandemic) directly affects bedside availability of ICEMs and patient care. Despite decades of global civil society advocacy in the UN system, ICEMs have remained chronically unavailable, inaccessible and unaffordable in Lower-and-Middle Income Countries, and there are recent reports of shortages in High Income Countries as well. The most prevalent symptoms in COVID-19 are breathlessness, cough, drowsiness, anxiety, agitation and delirium. Frequently used medicines include opioids such as morphine or fentanyl and midazolam, all of them listed as ICEMs. This paper describes the issues related to the lack of availability and limited access to ICEMs during the COVID-19 pandemic in both intensive and palliative care patients in countries of all income levels and makes recommendations for improving access.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pettus, Katherine; Cleary, James F.; de Lima, Liliana; Ahmed, Ebtesam; Radbruch, Lukas","journal":"J Pain Symptom Manage","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2ab45844ca4bbf8124c8c39a883b30dcadf3e69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204700.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392420303754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32387575/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392420303754?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.04.153","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Essential Medicines","United Nations","UN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bedside availability of ICEMs","COVID","used medicines","Controlled Essential Medicines","national drug control laws","national laws","High Income Countries","Middle Income Countries","Model List of Essential Medicines","lack of availability","income levels","palliative care patients","control of pain","patient care","pandemic","midazolam","international drug control conventions","national regulatory systems","limited access","global supply chains","decades of global civil society advocacy","United Nations","treaty bodies","recent reports of shortages","specialized agencies","opioid analgesics formulations","drowsiness","anxiety","sedative","breathlessness","cough","morphine","complex interaction","World Health Organization","agitation","anxiolytic substances","respiratory distress","opioids","regulations","delirium","diazepam","fentanyl","issues","recommendations","prevalent symptoms","Section","paper"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 457 fresh fecal samples were collected from piglets under 9 weeks old during 2013-2015 from organized (n=225) and unorganized (n=232) farms of Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Samples were collected from diarrheic (n =339) and non-diarrheic (n=118) piglets including local indigenous (n=130) and crossbreed (n=327) piglets in different seasons during the study period. The samples were processed for the isolation of E. coli and Salmonella and detection of their putative virulence genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Samples were also processed for the detection of Rotavirus and Picobirnavirus by RNA-polyacrylamide agarose gel electrophoresis and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 11 (2.40%) samples were found positive for two or more coinfecting enteric bacterial and viral pathogens. All the 11 positive fecal samples were recovered from diarrheic piglets. Salmonella Typhimurium (enterotoxin, stn gene) and Picobirnavirus genogroup 1 were found to be more frequent as coinfecting agents. Coinfection was recorded higher in unorganized (3.87%) compared to organized farm (0.88%). Again, higher detection was recorded in crossbreed (2.75%) than local indigenous piglets (1.53%). The occurrence of coinfection was found to be more common during summer (4.68%) followed by winter (2.27%) season. CONCLUSION: The present study highlighted the significance of E. coli, Salmonella, Rotavirus, and Picobirnavirus as important diarrheagenic pathogens causing coinfection in piglets in Northeast region of India. Probably, this is the first systematic study of the coinfection of four important diarrheagenic bacterial and viral agents associated with piglet diarrhea in India.","publish_time":"2019-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kylla, Hosterson; Dutta, Tapan K.; Roychoudhury, Parimal; Subudhi, Prasant K.","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3cba082e1f0b91d9143ea8e72eada78be0474064.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6460878.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2019.224-230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31040562/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli","E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Northeast","India","Nagaland"],"keyphrases":["diarrheic piglets","positive fecal samples","fecal samples of pre-weaned piglets","local indigenous piglets","fresh fecal samples","coinfection of enteric bacterial","viral pathogens","detection of Rotavirus","occurrence of coinfection","present study","study period","systematic study","Picobirnavirus genogroup","viral agents","Salmonella Typhimurium","higher detection","important diarrheagenic pathogens","important diarrheagenic bacterial","Northeast region of India","Escherichia coli","RT-PCR","coinfecting agents","total","crossbreed","reverse transcriptase-PCR","organized farm","RNA-polyacrylamide agarose gel electrophoresis","putative virulence genes","polymerase chain reaction","stn gene","enterotoxin","farms of Manipur","piglet diarrhea","different seasons","Meghalaya","Mizoram","significance of","prevalence","METHODS","isolation of","weeks old","Nagaland","MATERIALS","CONCLUSION","winter","summer","RESULTS","AIM"],"language":"en"},

Early intubation and mechanical ventilation are essential to prevent complications and worsening, especially in resource-limited settings with very few centers having expertise to manage critical cases.

The CT imaging characteristics were analyzed among patients with different clinical types. RESULTS Among 67 patients, 3(4.5%) were mild, 35 (52.2%) were moderate, 22 (32.8%) were severe, and 7(10.4%) were critical ill. No significant abnormality in chest CT imaging in mild patients. The 35 cases of moderate type included 3 (8.6%) single lesions, the 22 cases of severe cases included 1 (4.5%) single lesion and the rest cases were with multiple lesions. CT images of moderate patients were mainly manifested by solid plaque shadow and halo sign (18/35, 51.4%); while fibrous strip shadow with ground glass shadow was more frequent in severe cases (7/22, 31.8%).

The general assumption is that the signal has only a few non-zero entries. Given an estimate for the noise level a common convex approach to recover the signal is basis pursuit denoising (BPDN). If the measurement matrix has the robust null space property with respect to the $\\ell_2$-norm, BPDN obeys stable and robust recovery guarantees. In the case of unknown noise levels, nonnegative least squares recovers non-negative signals if the measurement matrix fulfills an additional property (sometimes called the $M^\u002B$-criterion). However, if the measurement matrix is the biadjacency matrix of a random left regular bipartite graph it obeys with a high probability the null space property with respect to the $\\ell_1$-norm with optimal parameters. Therefore, we discuss non-negative least absolute deviation (NNLAD). For these measurement matrices, we prove a uniform, stable and robust recovery guarantee. Such guarantees are important, since binary expander matrices are sparse and thus allow for fast sketching and recovery. We will further present a method to solve the NNLAD numerically and show that this is comparable to state of the art methods. Lastly, we explain how the NNLAD can be used for group testing in the recent COVID-19 crisis and why contamination of specimens may be modeled as peaky noise, which favors $\\ell_1$ based data fidelity terms.","publish_time":"2020-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petersen, Hendrik Bernd; Bah, Bubacarr; Jung, Peter","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/453b25bc86ec94ab3326543c8ca885218b451312.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13092v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["measurement matrix","measurement matrices","ell","NNLAD","robust recovery guarantees","biadjacency matrix","robust null space property","respect","non-negative signals","BPDN","additional property","peaky noise","norm","case of unknown noise levels","binary expander matrices","squares","random left regular bipartite graph","high probability","uniform","common convex approach","recent COVID","basis pursuit denoising","crisis","group testing","absolute deviation","based data fidelity terms","contamination of specimens","state","art methods","linear measurements","goal","fast sketching","estimate","compressed sensing","optimal parameters","general assumption","entries","criterion"],"language":"en"},

By using a mean-field approach, we derive an analytical estimate of the epidemic threshold for SIS and SIR epidemic models for a general adaptive strategy, which strongly depends on the correlations between activity and attractiveness in the susceptible and infected states. We focus on a strong adaptive behaviour, implementing two types of quarantine inspired by recent real case studies: an active quarantine, in which the population compensates the loss of links rewiring the ineffective connections towards non-quarantining nodes, and an inactive quarantine, in which the links with quarantined nodes are not rewired. Both strategies feature the same epidemic threshold but they strongly differ in the dynamics of active phase. We show that the active quarantine is extremely less effective in reducing the impact of the epidemic in the active phase compared to the inactive one, and that in SIR model a late adoption of measures requires inactive quarantine to reach containment.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mancastroppa, Marco; Burioni, Raffaella; Colizza, Vittoria; Vezzani, Alessandro","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b3afae02875c0305b543a6adc7992b1f2dc0e09.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07902v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inactive quarantine","epidemic threshold","adaptive activity","types of quarantine","epidemic process","SIR epidemic models","strong adaptive behaviour","dynamics of active phase","general adaptive strategy","attractiveness","SIR model","loss of links","quarantined nodes","non-quarantining nodes","late adoption of measures","recent real case studies","ineffective connections","SIS","temporal networks","analytical estimate","population","change","mean-field approach","infected states","containment","impact","infection","correlations","strategies"],"language":"en"},

This observation has particular implications for the low- and middle-income countries currently in the early stages of their local epidemics.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pellis, Lorenzo; Scarabel, Francesca; Stage, Helena B.; Overton, Christopher E.; Chappell, Lauren H.

Its contagious nature and clinical similarity to other pneumonias make separating subjects contracted with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia a priority and a challenge. However, COVID-19 testing has been greatly limited by the availability and cost of existing methods, even in developed countries like the US. Intrigued by the wide availability of routine blood tests, we propose to leverage them for COVID-19 testing using the power of machine learning. Two proven-robust machine learning model families, random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs), are employed to tackle the challenge. Trained on blood data from 208 moderate COVID-19 subjects and 86 subjects with non-COVID-19 moderate viral pneumonia, the best result is obtained in an SVM-based classifier with an accuracy of 84%, a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 80%, and a precision of 92%. The results are found explainable from both machine learning and medical perspectives. A privacy-protected web portal is set up to help medical personnel in their practice and the trained models are released for developers to further build other applications.

At our disposal we have a testing scheme which allows us to test a group of individuals, such that the outcome of the test is positive, if and only if at least one infected individual is part of the test. All tests are carried out in parallel. The overall goal is to find a test design and an inference algorithm requiring as few tests as possible, such that the infected individuals can be identified with high probability. As most relevant during the outbreak of pandemic diseases (Wang et al., 2011), our analysis focusses on the so-called sublinear regime of group testing, where $k \\sim n^\\theta$. The optimal group testing schemes require a test-size of $\\sim n/k$ and each individual has to take part in $\\sim \\log n$ tests (Coja-Oghlan et. al, 2019). In real world applications, like testing many individuals in a short period of time during the outbreak of epidemics, pooling in such a way is not possible due to dilution effects. Evidence of those effects is known for important applications like HIV (Wein, 1996) or COVID-19 (Seifried and Ciesek, 2020). Our main contribution is the analysis of a group testing model, where we restrict the individuals-per-test to be finite. We present an easy to implement scheme to pool individuals into tests under these natural restrictions coming with the efficient decoding algorithm DD and present simulations which suggest that the decoding procedure succeeds for moderate population sizes. Furthermore, we show that our pooling scheme requires the fewest tests as possible under all pooling schemes. Finally, we apply our methods to the finitely many tests-per-individuals setting, where we provide a full understanding of the random regular test-design in this model by building up on work of (Gandikota et al., 2016).","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gebhard, Oliver; Hahn-Klimroth, Max; Parczyk, Olaf; Penschuck, Manuel; Rolvien, Maurice","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af967c8c92d92d507fd49f8c2a8ae10f086b3df4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11860v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group of individuals","infected individuals","test design","test-size","group testing model","group testing problem","fewest tests","optimal group testing schemes","sim n","so-called sublinear regime of group testing","random regular test-design","pooling schemes","log n","large population of size","decoding procedure","efficient decoding algorithm DD","inference algorithm","outbreak of epidemics","analysis focusses","present simulations","important applications","dilution effects","outbreak of pandemic diseases","moderate population sizes","real world applications","natural restrictions","aims","short period of time","Wein","small set","way","Coja-Oghlan et","COVID","HIV","Wang","understanding","outcome","main contribution","overall goal","high probability","Seifried","Ciesek","work","theta","disposal","Gandikota","Evidence","methods"],"language":"en"},

In this scenario, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect abnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which may be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the available COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning (DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on a related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four classes viz. $normal$, $other\\_disease$, $pneumonia$ and $Covid-19$. A 5-fold cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using chest X-Rays to diagnose COVID-19.

Different scenarios stem from linear stability theory and comprise exponential instabilities of the mean flow, neutral modes, transient growth from non-normal operators, and parametric instabilities from temporal mean-flow variations, among others. These mechanisms, each potentially capable of leading to the observed turbulence structure, are rooted in simplified theories and conceptual arguments. Whether the flow follows any or a combination of them remains unclear. Here, we devise a collection of numerical experiments in which the Navier-Stokes equations are sensibly modified to quantify the role of the different linear mechanisms at low Reynolds number ($Re_\\tau\\approx180$). We do this by DNS of turbulent channel flows, in which the energy transfer from the streamwise-averaged mean-flow ($\\boldsymbol{U}$) to the fluctuating velocities ($\\boldsymbol{u}\u0027$) is constrained to preclude a targeted linear mechanism. In contrast to other studies, our approach allows for direct evaluation of cause-and-effect links between the linear energy injection from $\\boldsymbol{U}$ to $\\boldsymbol{u}\u0027$ in a fully nonlinear setup. We show that turbulence persists when exponential instabilities of the mean flow are suppressed. Removing all exponential instabilities only reduces the turbulent fluctuations by 10%. We also show that the energy transfer from $\\boldsymbol{U}$ to $\\boldsymbol{u}\u0027$ via transient growth alone, without exponential or parametric instabilities, suffices to sustain turbulence. Finally, we demonstrate that a collection of simulations with frozen-in-time $\\boldsymbol{U}$ that only support transient growth provides a faithful representation of the actual time-varying energy transfer from $\\boldsymbol{U}$ to $\\boldsymbol{u}\u0027$.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lozano-Dur\u0027an, Adri\u0027an; Constantinou, Navid C.; Nikolaidis, Marios-Andreas; Karp, Michael","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/877bcf3af510e27e726f4a3ebf0518ef2081fcb8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05303v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["boldsymbol","exponential instabilities","mean flow","linear energy injection","parametric instabilities","different linear mechanisms","energy-injection mechanisms","transient growth","linear processes","wall turbulence","temporal mean-flow variations","streamwise-averaged mean-flow","nonlinear nature of turbulence","actual time-varying energy transfer","linear stability theory","observed turbulence structure","targeted linear mechanism","turbulent fluctuations","collection of simulations","nonlinear setup","Different scenarios stem","collection of numerical experiments","DNS of turbulent channel flows","non-normal operators","neutral modes","faithful representation","effect links","approach","low Reynolds number","evidence","simplified theories","direct evaluation of cause","capable of leading","Navier-Stokes equations","studies","conceptual arguments","role","fluctuating velocities","contrast","combination"],"language":"en"},

While we find no relationship between city size and exponential growth rate (directly related to $R0$, which denotes average the number of cases an infected individual infects), we do find that larger cities seem to begin exponential spreading earlier and are thus in a more advanced stage of the pandemic at the time of submission. We also use more recent data to compute prediction errors given our models, and find that in many cities, exponential growth models trained on data before March 26 are poor predictors for case numbers in this more recent period (March 26-30), likely indicating a reduction in the number of new cases facilitated through social distancing.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heroy, Samuel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/189f38311305a39224ad1a55b7da054056d64bf9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01248v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exponential growth models","exponential growth rate","exponential behavior of case growth","exponential spreading","linear growth models","case data","number of cases","recent data","number of new cases","explanatory performance of different simple exponential","case numbers","study","different metropolitan areas","early stage","metropolitan scale","advanced stage","recent period","larger cities","city size","US county-level COVID","pandemic","poor predictors","prediction errors","relationship","localized outbreaks","social distancing","infected individual","reduction","time of submission","R0"],"language":"en"},

Many clustering algorithms exist but most social scientists find them difficult to understand, and tools do not provide any guidance to choose algorithms, or to evaluate results taking into account the prior knowledge of the scientists. Our work introduces a new clustering paradigm and a visual analytics user interface that address this issue. It is based on a process that 1) captures the prior knowledge of the scientists as a set of incomplete clusters, 2) runs multiple clustering algorithms (similarly to clustering ensemble methods), 3) visualizes the results of all the algorithms ranked and summarized by how well each algorithm matches the prior knowledge, 5) evaluates the consensus between user-selected algorithms and 6) allows users to review details and iteratively update the acquired knowledge. We describe our paradigm using an initial functional prototype, then provide two examples of use and early feedback from social scientists. We believe our clustering paradigm offers a novel constructive method to iteratively build knowledge while avoiding being overly influenced by the results of often-randomly selected black-box clustering algorithms.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pister, Alexis; Buono, Paolo; Fekete, Jean-Daniel; Plaisant, Catherine; Valdivia, Paola","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/887e3081c628fb481a9270a91fea71d676b0a926.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02972v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiple clustering algorithms","social scientists","new clustering paradigm","PK-clustering","prior knowledge","black-box clustering algorithms","user-selected algorithms","new paradigm","acquired knowledge","results","social networks","meaningful clusters","set of incomplete clusters","visual analytics user interface","examples of use","early feedback","novel constructive method","consensus","account","initial functional prototype","issue","details","users","ensemble methods","tools","guidance","process"],"language":"en"},

Here, we propose novel EEG parameters created by using two kinds of waveforms discriminated by voltage thresholds from a new perspective. Methods: Six young-adult beagles and 6 senior beagles were anaesthetised with end-tidal sevoflurane (SEV) of 2.0%-4.0% in 0.5% intervals, and 2-channel EEG (256 Hz) was recorded. Two events were discriminated: a consecutive part ({\\tau}) with a peak-to-peak potential difference (Vpp) within 1-6, 8, 12, or 20 mcrV, and another part (burst) with Vpp outside the threshold. Number of {\\tau} (N{\\tau}), mean {\\tau} duration (M{\\tau}), total percentage of {\\tau} (SR{\\tau}), mean burst duration (Mbst), and amplitude of burst (Abst) were evaluated as anaesthesia depth indicators using Pearsons correlation coefficients (r). Results: When Vpp was near the suppression wave threshold, N{\\tau} had the highest correlation with SEV in both groups. As SEV was increased until onset of burst suppression, N{\\tau} decreased, M{\\tau} remained unchanged, and Mbst and Abst increased. In the young-adult group, mean |r| exceeded 0.95 for N{\\tau} with Vpp of 4-6 mcrV, for Mbst with Vpp of 8-12 mcrV, and for Abst with Vpp of 4-12 mcrV. In the senior group, r exceeded 0.90 for N{\\tau} with Vpp of 4 mcrV and for Abst with Vpp of 5-12 mcrV. Conclusion: We developed new EEG parameters that were almost perfectly correlated with volatile anaesthetic concentrations using traditional bipolar recording.

Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives. Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Shaoping; Gao, Yuan; Niu, Zhangming; Jiang, Yinghui; Li, Lao; Xiao, Xianglu; Wang, Minhao; Fang, Evandro Fei; Menpes-Smith, Wade; Xia, Jun; Ye, Hui; Yang, Guang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/003d2e515e1aaf06f0052769953e861ed8e56608.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06689v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["China","Algeria"],"keyphrases":["prognosis of COVID","non-COVID","clinical diagnosis","RT-PCR","China","PCR testing resources","chest CT imaging","large-scale clinical studies","following clinical decision","requirements of manual labelling of CT images","shortage of RT","laboratory testing","pandemic situation","treated disease","accurate infection detection","novel coronavirus disease","consequence of substantial alveolar damage","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","developed technique","valuable tool","progressive respiratory failure","death","tests","weakly supervised deep learning strategy","golden standard","wide deployment","outbreak","treatment","circumstances","onset of serious illness","proposed method","risk of fatality","false negatives","Algeria","study","Wuhan","cases","patients","promising results","Italy","world"],"language":"en"},

A loosely fitted simple cotton cloth mask (with a pore size ~ 4 microns) qualitatively changes the propagation of the high velocity jet, and largely eliminates the turbulent cloud downstream of the mask. About 12\\% of the airflow leaks around the sides of a mask, considering a uniform gap of only 1 mm all around, between the face and the mask.

It has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions worldwide. Any technological tool that can be provided to healthcare practitioners to save time, effort, and possibly lives has crucial importance. The main tools practitioners currently use to diagnose Covid-19 are Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Computed Tomography (CT), which require significant time, resources and acknowledged experts. X-ray imaging is a common and easily accessible tool that has great potential for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel approach for Covid-19 recognition from chest X-ray images. Despite the importance of the problem, recent studies in this domain produced not so satisfactory results due to the limited datasets available for training. Recall that Deep Learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large datasets, such data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for Covid-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based classification (collaborative or sparse representation) might provide satisfactory performance with limited size datasets, but they generally fall short in performance or speed compared to Machine Learning methods. To address this deficiency, Convolution Support Estimation Network (CSEN) has recently been proposed as a bridge between model-based and Deep Learning approaches by providing a non-iterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally sparse representation coefficient\u0027 support, which is critical information for class decision in representation based techniques.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamac, Mehmet; Ahishali, Mete; Degerli, Aysen; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

Here, we propose a new method of event embedding of temporal networks, called weg2vec, which builds on temporal and structural similarities of events to learn a low dimensional representation of a temporal network. This projection successfully captures latent structures and similarities between events involving different nodes at different times and provides ways to predict the final outcome of spreading processes unfolding on the temporal structure.","publish_time":"2019-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torricelli, Maddalena; Karsai, M\u0027arton; Gauvin, Laetitia","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02425v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Temporal networks","temporal structure","conventional network","structural similarities of events","different nodes","different times","latent structures","static structures","structural regularities","low dimensional representation","ways","advantage","processes","models","techniques","new method of event","description of real systems","final outcome","projection","weg2vec","local fabrics","complex information","handful of methods"],"language":"en"},

Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR.

Fecal samples were collected weekly for 4 weeks from each of 1045 calves under 30 days of age on 11 dairy farms in south-western Ontario during the summer of 2003 and the winter of 2004. A questionnaire designed to gather information on calf-level management factors was administered on farm for each calf in the study. Samples were examined for C. parvum oocysts by microscopy, and a subset of specimens was also tested for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus. The consistency of each sample was scored and recorded at the time of collection in order to assess the presence or absence of diarrhea. In addition, a blood sample was taken from each calf upon enrolment in the study, for assessment of maternal antibody transfer and for polymerase chain reaction testing for persistent bovine viral diarrhea virus infection. Using the GLLAMM function in Stata 9.0, multilevel regression techniques were employed to investigate associations between management practices and the risk of C. parvum shedding or diarrhea. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of 78% of the 919 calves from which all four fecal samples had been collected. Furthermore, 73% of the 846 calves for which all four fecal consistency scores had been recorded were diarrheic at the time of collection of at least one sample. Significant predictors of the calf-level risk of C. parvum shedding included the use of calf diarrhea prophylaxis in pregnant cows, and the type of maternity facilities in which the calves were born. Factors associated with an increased risk of diarrhea were leaving the calf with the dam for more than an hour after birth, and the birth of a calf in the summer as opposed to winter. Calves shedding C. parvum oocysts had 5.3 (95% CI 4.4, 6.4) times the odds of diarrhea than non-shedding calves, controlling for other factors included in the final multivariable model. Furthermore, infected calves shedding more than 2.2\u00D7105 oocysts per gram of feces were more likely to scour than infected calves shedding lower numbers of oocysts (OR=6.1, 95% CI 4.8, 7.8). The odds of diarrhea in calves shedding oocysts that had been allowed to remain with their dams for more than an hour were higher than the odds of diarrhea in shedding calves that had been separated from their dams within an hour after birth.","publish_time":"2007-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trotz-Williams, Lise A.; Wayne Martin, S.; Leslie, Kenneth E.; Duffield, Todd; Nydam, Daryl V.; Peregrine, Andrew S.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3200c0afb814f23b81e5e827d5640f034533eb7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114353.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587707001079; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587707001079","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ontario"],"keyphrases":["parvum shedding","non-shedding calves","histories of calf diarrhea","odds of diarrhea","infected calves","absence of diarrhea","calf-level risk of","calf-level factors","use of calf diarrhea prophylaxis","risk of neonatal diarrhea","increased risk of diarrhea","Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts","calf-level management factors","lower numbers of oocysts","hour","birth","Fecal samples","persistent bovine viral diarrhea virus infection","bovine rotavirus","bovine coronavirus","dairy farms","study","summer","time of collection","fecal consistency scores","blood sample","dams","winter","south-western Ontario","management practices","gram of feces","polymerase chain reaction testing","Salmonella","assessment of maternal antibody transfer","pregnant cows","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","Stata","associations","information","multilevel regression techniques","days of age","order","presence","microscopy","times","type of maternity facilities","GLLAMM function","subset of specimens","Significant predictors","final multivariable model","enrolment","weeks","cryptosporidiosis","addition","questionnaire","work"],"language":"en"},

In this study, WNV was isolated from Vero cells inoculated with both nasal swab and pooled trachea/lung samples from a dromedary calf in Dubai. Complete-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis using the near-whole-genome polyprotein revealed that the virus belonged to lineage 1a. There was no clustering of the present WNV with other WNVs isolated in other parts of the Middle East. Within lineage 1a, the dromedary WNV occupied a unique position, although it was most closely related to other WNVs of cluster 2. Comparative analysis revealed that the putative E protein encoded by the genome possessed the original WNV E protein glycosylation motif NYS at E154\u2013156, which contained the N-linked glycosylation site at N-154 associated with increased WNV pathogenicity and neuroinvasiveness. In the putative NS1 protein, the A70S substitution observed in other cluster 2 WNVs and P250, which has been implicated in neuroinvasiveness, were present. In addition, the foo motif in the putative NS2A protein, which has been implicated in neuroinvasiveness, was detected. Notably, the amino-acid residues at 14 positions in the present dromedary WNV genome differed from those in most of the closely related WNV strains in cluster 2 of lineage 1a, with the majority of these differences observed in the putative E and NS5 proteins. The present study is the first to demonstrate the isolation of WNV from dromedaries. This finding expands the possible reservoirs of WNV and sources of WNV infection.","publish_time":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joseph, Sunitha; Wernery, Ulrich; Teng, Jade LL; Wernery, Renate; Huang, Yi; Patteril, Nissy AG; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Elizabeth, Shyna K; Fan, Rachel YY; Lau, Susanna KP; Kinne, J\u00F6rg; Woo, Patrick CY","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a21f8d21e09607e555468d0ed155126daaeb37cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4932647.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27273223/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.53","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV","NYS"],"locations":["Middle East","North Africa","Spain","Dubai"],"keyphrases":["present WNV","isolation of WNV","present dromedary WNV genome","related WNV strains","sources of WNV infection","possible reservoirs of WNV","increased WNV pathogenicity","putative E protein","original WNV E protein glycosylation motif NYS","putative NS1 protein","putative NS2A protein","WNVs of cluster","lineage","present study","neuroinvasiveness","genome polyprotein","dromedary calf","Complete-genome sequencing","Middle East","foo motif","N-linked glycosylation site","phylogenetic analysis","Comparative analysis","sera of dromedaries","West Nile virus","lung samples","positions","nasal swab","pooled trachea","North Africa","A70S substitution","Spain","E154","Vero cells","antibodies","amino-acid residues","Dubai","differences","NS5 proteins","parts","unique position","addition","majority","Bactrian camels","P250","clustering"],"language":"en"},

Between September 2013 and December 2014, samples from 372 children aged between 1 month and 5 years were collected, and tested using multiplex real-time RT-PCR by a commercial assay for 21 respiratory pathogens. In addition, samples were screened for the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae 16S rDNA using real-time PCR. The viral distribution and its association with clinical symptoms were statistically analyzed. Viral pathogens were detected in 342 (91.93%) of the samples of which 28.76% were single positive and 63.17% had multiple infections. The most frequent detected viruses were rhinovirus (55.64%), respiratory syncytial virus A/B (33.06%), adenovirus (25.00%), coronavirus NL63, HKU1, OC43, and 229E (21.50%), and metapneumovirus A/B (16.12%). Children in the youngest age group (1\u20133 months) exhibited the highest frequencies of infection. Related to their frequency of detection, RSV A/B was the most associated pathogen with patient\u2019s demographic situation and clinical manifestations (p\u003C0.05). Parainfluenza virus 1\u20134 and parechovirus were found to increase the risk of death (p\u003C0.05). Adenovirus was statistically associated to the manifestation of gastroenteritis (p = 0.004). Rhinovirus infection increases the duration of oxygen support (p = 0.042). Coronavirus group was statistically associated with the manifestation of bronchiolitis (p = 0.009) and laryngitis (p = 0.017). Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA was detected in 143 (38.44%) of tested samples. However, only 53 samples had a concentration of C-reactive protein from equal to higher than 20 milligrams per liter, and 6 of them were single positive for Streptocuccus pneumoniae.

For multi-regional systems with strongly connected transportation networks, we prove that if [Formula: see text] then the disease will be eradicated from each region, while if [Formula: see text] there is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium, which is endemic in every region. If the transportation network is not strongly connected, then the model analysis shows that numerous endemic patterns can exist by admitting a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium, which may be disease free in some regions while endemic in other regions. We provide a procedure to detect the disease free and the endemic regions according to the network topology and local reproduction numbers. The main ingredients of the mathematical proofs are the inductive applications of the theory of asymptotically autonomous semiflows and cooperative dynamical systems. We visualise stability boundaries of equilibria in a parameter plane to illustrate the influence of the transportation network on the disease dynamics.

In addition to direct antimicrobial activity, these peptides participate in many cellular functions, including chemotaxis, wound healing, and even determination of canine coat colour. Various biologic and genetic approaches have helped to elucidate the role of antimicrobial peptide with respect innate immunity and host defense. Associations of antimicrobial peptides with various skin diseases, including psoriasis, rosacea and atopic dermatitis, have been documented in humans. In the longer term, therapeutic modulation of antimicrobial peptide expression may provide effective new treatments for disease. This review highlights current knowledge about antimicrobial peptides of the skin and circulating leukocytes, with particular focus on relevance to physiology and disease in companion animals.","publish_time":"2012-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leonard, Brian C.; Affolter, Verena K.; Bevins, Charles L.","journal":"Veterinary Dermatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/947c117680306bd7a95624111ec1b956a1d152f1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0177693b0767f0a5095f520c37e6f92eff593264.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3467306.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3164.2012.01037.x; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3467306?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22409270/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["roles of antimicrobial peptides","Associations of antimicrobial peptides","role of antimicrobial peptide","direct antimicrobial activity","therapeutic modulation of antimicrobial peptide expression","disease pathogenesis","various skin diseases","homeostatic functions","cellular functions","respect innate immunity","physiology","relevance","psoriasis","effective new treatments","review highlights current knowledge","wound healing","rosacea","particular focus","leukocytes","involvement","host defense","longer term","chemotaxis","determination of canine coat colour","atopic dermatitis","genetic approaches","significant inroads","companion animals","years","addition"],"language":"en"},

This study compared the effects of select agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone, propofol, isoflurane, and \u03B1-chloralose) on urodynamic (\u0394pressure, bladder capacity, bladder compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (change in heart rate [\u0394HR], average heart rate [HR], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated cystometrograms across five adult male cats. \u0394pressure was greatest with propofol, bladder capacity was highest with \u03B1-chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with \u03B1-chloralose. Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. Cats progressed to a deeper plane of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller \u0394HR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol and alfaxalone. Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery was shortest with dexmedetomidine.

The SARS-CoV emerged in 2002 as an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans, and FIPV infection causes a chronic and often fatal peritonitis in cats. A unique collection of 33 plant lectins with different specificities were evaluated. The plant lectins possessed marked antiviral properties against both coronaviruses with EC50 values in the lower microgram/ml range (middle nanomolar range), being non-toxic (CC50) at 50\u2013100\u03BCg/ml. The strongest anti-coronavirus activity was found predominantly among the mannose-binding lectins. In addition, a number of galactose-, N-acetylgalactosamine-, glucose-, and N-acetylglucosamine-specific plant agglutinines exhibited anti-coronaviral activity. A significant correlation (with an r-value of 0.70) between the EC50 values of the 10 mannose-specific plant lectins effective against the two coronaviruses was found. In contrast, little correlation was seen between the activity of other types of lectins. Two targets of possible antiviral intervention were identified in the replication cycle of SARS-CoV. The first target is located early in the replication cycle, most probably viral attachment, and the second target is located at the end of the infectious virus cycle.","publish_time":"2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keyaerts, Els; Vijgen, Leen; Pannecouque, Christophe; Van Damme, Els; Peumans, Willy; Egberink, Herman; Balzarini, Jan; Van Ranst, Marc","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/654fd1e94791bcedde45f6f97e5b40e19519262a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114093.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354207002380; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354207002380","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral activity of plant lectins","types of lectins","mannose-specific plant lectins effective","mannose-binding lectins","SARS-CoV","specific plant agglutinines","replication cycle of SARS","anti-coronaviral activity","infectious virus cycle","strongest anti-coronavirus activity","FIPV infection","coronaviruses","EC50 values","feline infectious peritonitis virus","marked antiviral properties","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection","lower microgram","N-acetylglucosamine","different specificities","targets of possible antiviral intervention","N-acetylgalactosamine","fatal peritonitis","little correlation","significant correlation","different glycan structures","middle nanomolar range","humans","specificity","glucose","\u03BCg","viral attachment","end","number of galactose","unique collection","CC50","cats","r-value","addition","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The molecular and cellular basis for how SARS CoV impacts the host immune system resulting in severe SARS, however, has not been elucidated. The variable clinical course of SARS may be the result of complex programs of host responses against the infectious agent. Therefore, the systematic analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS CoV is imperative in building as complete an immunological model as possible of host immunity and inflammatory responses during illness.

The present study developed a three-dimensional drift-flux model for particle movements in turbulent indoor airflows, and combined it into Eulerian approaches. To account for the process of particle deposition at solid boundaries, a semi-empirical deposition model was adopted in which the size-dependent deposition characteristics were well resolved. After validation against the experimental data in a scaled isothermal chamber and in a full-scale non-isothermal environmental chamber, the drift-flux model was used to investigate the deposition rates and human exposures to particles from two different sources with three typical ventilation systems: mixing ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation (DV), and under-floor air distribution (UFAD). For particles originating from the supply air, a V-shaped curve of the deposition velocity variation as a function of particle size was observed. The minimum deposition appeared at 0.1\u2013 [Formula: see text]. For supermicron particles, the ventilation type and air exchange rate had an ignorable effect on the deposition rate. The movements of submicron particles were like tracer gases while the gravitational settling effect should be taken into account for particles larger than [Formula: see text]. The temporal increment of human exposure to a step-up particle release in the supply air was determined, among many factors, by the distance between the occupant and air outlet. The larger the particle size, the lower the human exposure. For particles released from an internal heat source, the concentration stratification of small particles (diameter [Formula: see text]) in the vertical direction appeared with DV and UFAD, and it was found the advantageous principle for gaseous pollutants that a relatively less-polluted occupied zone existed in DV and UFAD was also applicable to small particles.","publish_time":"2007-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, N.P.; Niu, J.L.","journal":"Atmos Environ (1994)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fdb855ab0a4b5620943d197aed84dfa54fd3f6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185799.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2007.01.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S135223100700060X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362759/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135223100700060X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UFAD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["process of particle deposition","particles larger","deposition rates","minimum deposition","supermicron particles","particle movements","movements of submicron particles","Particle dispersion","supply air","deposition velocity variation","function of particle size","semi-empirical deposition model","size-dependent deposition characteristics","air outlet","concentration stratification of small particles","UFAD","Formula","text","step-up particle release","air exchange rate","mixing ventilation","ventilation type","displacement ventilation","typical ventilation systems","three-dimensional drift-flux model","human exposures","under-floor air distribution","account","temporal increment of human exposure","scaled isothermal chamber","ignorable effect","full-scale non-isothermal environmental chamber","gravitational settling effect","solid boundaries","MV","tracer gases","different sources","V-shaped curve","diameter","internal heat source","turbulent indoor airflows","experimental data","man-made enclosed environments","distance","polluted occupied zone","vertical direction","gaseous pollutants","present study","advantageous principle","validation","factors","well-being of occupants","Eulerian approaches"],"language":"en"},

The objective was to determine if the use of injectable trace minerals (ITM; Se, Zn, Cu, and Mn) concurrent with a modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine enhances the immune response and onset of protection in beef calves challenged with BVDV2 five days after vaccination. Forty-five calves were randomly assigned to one of three groups (15/group): VAC \u002B ITM, received MLV-vaccine and ITM (Multimin\u00AE90) subcutaneously (SC); VAC \u002B SAL, received the same vaccine and saline SC; or UNVAC, unvaccinated. Five days after vaccination (d.0), calves were challenged with BVDV2 strain 890. Health status was evaluated and blood samples were collected for leukocyte counts, BVDV1 and 2 serum neutralizing antibody (SNA), BVDV-PCR, percentage of CD4(\u002B), CD8(\u002B), WC1(\u002B) and CD25(\u002B) T-cells. VAC \u002B ITM had lower health scores than UNVAC (d.8 and 9). VAC \u002B ITM had higher BVDV1 \u0026 2 SNA titers than VAC \u002B SAL and UNVAC on d.21 and 28. Lymphocyte counts decreased in UNVAC but not in VAC \u002B ITM or VAC \u002B SAL (d.3 to 11). CD4(\u002B) T-cells significantly decreased in UNVAC and VAC \u002B SAL (d.3).

In summary, vaccination induced a rapid protection against BVDV2 infection. Administration of ITM was associated with increased SNA response to BVDV1 \u0026 2, enhanced health status, mitigation of CD4(\u002B) T-cells decreased, and reduction of T-cell activation in calves challenged with BVDV2 five days after immunization.

They possess a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and cardio-protective effects. The present study was aimed to evaluate the protective effect of theaflavin on glycoprotein content and tricorboxylic acid cycle enzymes in high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats as there was no study on this aspect. Diabetes was induced in male albino Wistar rats by feeding them with high-fat diet and injecting them intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (40 mg/kg b.wt). RESULTS: Different doses of theaflavin (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg b.wt /day) were administered orally to high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for 30 days for fixing the glucose lowering dose. However, the dose at 100 mg/kg b.wt showed a significant reduction in the levels of plasma glucose and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance with concomitant elevation of insulin when compared to the other two doses (25 and 50 mg/kg b.wt). Hence, 100 mg/kg b.wt was fixed as an effective dose and used for further analysis. Theaflavin administration restored the altered glycosylated hemoglobin, hemoglobin and glycoproteins (Hexose, hexosamine, fucose, and sialic acid) and TCA cycle enzymes (isocitrate dehydrogenase, \u03B1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase) near the normal levels by correcting hyperglycemia. Improved histological changes were observed in the pancreas of diabetic rats upon treatment with theaflavin which supported the biochemicals investigated. CONCLUSION: The effect produced by the theaflavin on various parameters was comparable to that of metformin\u2014a reference antidiabetic drug. These findings suggest that theaflavin can replace the commercial drugs which could lead to reduction in toxicity and side effect caused by the later as well as reduce the secondary completions.","publish_time":"2019-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gothandam, Kirubananthan; Ganesan, Vijayan Siva; Ayyasamy, Thangaraj; Ramalingam, Sundaram","journal":"J Basic Appl Zool","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de7deda31a9a1ec0fea9ace86abc8dfc790f6fd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091795.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41936-019-0115-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32219004/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance","TCA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wt","protective effect of theaflavin","Theaflavin administration","high-fat diet","streptozotocin","Different doses of theaflavin","pancreas of diabetic rats","isocitrate dehydrogenase","succinate dehydrogenase","malate dehydrogenase","\u03B1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase","effective dose","tricorboxylic acid cycle enzymes","male albino Wistar rats","TCA cycle enzymes","levels of plasma glucose","sialic acid","normal levels","significant reduction","black tea","consumed tea","present study","altered glycosylated hemoglobin","concomitant elevation of insulin","cardio-protective effects","Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance","glycoprotein content","glycoproteins","anti-inflammatory","hexosamine","metformin","antioxidant","Theaflavins","major polyphenols","fucose","Hexose","treatment","anti-tumor","various parameters","broad spectrum of biological activities","days","reference antidiabetic drug","Diabetes","BACKGROUND","correcting hyperglycemia","RESULTS","commercial drugs","Improved histological changes","world","analysis","biochemicals","toxicity","secondary completions","aspect","CONCLUSION","findings"],"language":"en"},

The inter-domain disulfide bond between light chain (Lc) and heavy chain (Hc) in human IgG1 lends structural support for antibody scaffold stability, optimal antigen binding, and normal Fc function. Recently, human IgG1\u03BB has been suggested to exhibit significantly greater susceptibility to reduction of the inter Lc-Hc disulfide bond relative to the same disulfide bond in human IgG1\u03BA. To understand the molecular basis for this observed difference in stability, the sequence and structure of human IgG1\u03BB and human IgG1\u03BA were compared. Based on this Lc comparison, three single mutations were made in the \u03BB Lc proximal to the cysteine residue, which forms a disulfide bond with the Hc. We determined that deletion of S214 (dS) improved resistance of the association between Lc and Hc to thermal stress. In addition, deletion of this terminal serine from the Lc of IgG1\u03BB provided further benefit, including an increase in stability at elevated pH, increased yield from transient transfection, and improved in vitro antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). These observations support the conclusion that the presence of the terminal serine of the \u03BB Lc creates a weaker inter-chain disulfide bond between the Lc and Hc, leading to slightly reduced stability and a potential compromise in IgG1\u03BB function. Our data from a human IgG1\u03BB provide a basis for further investigation of the effects of deleting terminal serine from \u03BBLc on the stability and function of other human IgG1\u03BB antibodies.","publish_time":"2013-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, Yang; Zeng, Lin; Zhu, Aiping; Blanc, Tim; Patel, Dipa; Pennello, Anthony; Bari, Amtul; Ng, Stanley; Persaud, Kris; Kang, Yun (Kenneth); Balderes, Paul; Surguladze, David; Hindi, Sagit; Zhou, Qinwei; Ludwig, Dale L.; Snavely, Marshall","journal":"MAbs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db6ef4648f49c12082d38056e00a106f8c2c510b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4169035.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23567210/; https://doi.org/10.4161/mabs.24291","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Lc of IgG1\u03BB","human IgG1\u03BB antibodies","Lc-Hc disulfide bond relative","structure of human IgG1\u03BB","Lc comparison","IgG1\u03BB function","human IgG1\u03BA","\u03BB Lc proximal","inter-domain disulfide bond","weaker inter-chain disulfide bond","reduced stability","terminal serine","antibody scaffold stability","light chain","heavy chain","normal Fc function","improved resistance","potential compromise","structural support","molecular basis","deletion of S214","developability of monoclonal antibodies","potential therapeutic applications","antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity","optimal antigen binding","transient transfection","elevated pH","increased yield","critical success factor","association","sequence","cysteine residue","dS","observed difference","effects","\u03BBLc","Optimization of biophysical properties","single mutations","ADCC","presence","reduction","investigation","benefit","thermal stress","conclusion","addition","greater susceptibility","observations","data"],"language":"en"},

Though generally assumed to be selective for cellular transcripts, the extent to which SOX impacts viral mRNA stability has remained unknown. We addressed this issue using the model murine gammaherpesvirus MHV68 and, unexpectedly, found that all stages of viral gene expression are controlled through mRNA degradation. Using both comprehensive RNA expression profiling and half-life studies we reveal that the levels of the majority of viral mRNAs but not noncoding RNAs are tempered by MHV68 SOX (muSOX) activity. The targeting of viral mRNA by muSOX is functionally significant, as it impacts intracellular viral protein abundance and progeny virion composition. In the absence of muSOX-imposed gene expression control the viral particles display increased cell surface binding and entry as well as enhanced immediate early gene expression. These phenotypes culminate in a viral replication defect in multiple cell types as well as in vivo, highlighting the importance of maintaining the appropriate balance of viral RNA during gammaherpesviral infection.

The most severe impact of an SBV infection is the induction of malformations in newborns and abortions. Between 2011 and 2013 SBV spread throughout Europe in an unprecedented epidemic wave. SBV contains a tripartite genome consisting of the three negative-sense RNA segments L, M, and S. The virus is usually isolated from clinical samples by inoculation of KC (insect) or BHK-21 (mammalian) cells. Several virus passages are required to allow adaptation of SBV to cells in vitro. In the present study, the porcine SK-6 cell line was used for isolation and passaging of SBV. SK-6 cells proved to be more sensitive to SBV infection and allowed to produce higher titers more rapidly as in BHK-21 cells after just one passage. No adaptation was required. In order to determine the in vivo genetic stability of SBV during an epidemic spread of the virus the nucleotide sequence of the genome from seven SBV field isolates collected in summer 2012 in Switzerland was determined and compared to other SBV sequences available in GenBank. A total of 101 mutations, mostly transitions randomly dispersed along the L and M segment were found when the Swiss isolates were compared to the first SBV isolated late 2011 in Germany. However, when these mutations were studied in detail, a previously described hypervariable region in the M segment was identified. The S segment was completely conserved among all sequenced SBV isolates. To assess the in vitro genetic stability of SBV, three isolates were passage 10 times in SK-6 cells and sequenced before and after passaging. Between two and five nt exchanges per genome were found. This low in vitro mutation rate further demonstrates the suitability of SK-6 cells for SBV propagation.","publish_time":"2015-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hofmann, Martin A.; Mader, Markus; Fl\u00FCckiger, Franziska; Renzullo, Sandra","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9192953003cfd6e9c89966fac3d6b9b59b99381.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172431.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.01.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25623013/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515000279; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515000279","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Schmallenberg","S.

Strategies based upon small molecule antiviral agents, peptides, proteins or nucleic acids, would most likely prove efficient in multidrug combinations, in order to inhibit several steps of virus life cycle and prevent disease progression.","publish_time":"2010-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teissier, Elodie; Penin, Fran\u00E7ois; P\u00E9cheur, Eve-Isabelle","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/342160459c20d71ef6f3da97763dd855a5357b1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6259279.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21193846/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules16010221","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral proteins","inhibition of protein","protein interactions","viral envelope proteins","Entry inhibitors act","entry process","viral life cycles","peptide inhibitors","entry of enveloped viruses","order","therapeutic intervention","steps of virus life cycle","host cells","point of intervention","successive steps","lipid interactions","therapeutic requirements","human immunodeficiency virus","host cell receptors","peptides","small molecule antiviral agents","arbidol","use of doses compatible","Strategies","HIV","nucleic acids","disease progression","multidrug combinations","drugs","cellular components","efficacy","membrane"],"language":"en"},

Transmission of the pathogen has occurred through animal-to-human contact at first followed by human-to-human contact within families and health care facilities. DATA AND METHODS: This study is based on a retrospective analysis of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and July 2015. A Geoadditive variable model for binary outcomes was applied to account for both individual level risk factors as well spatial variation via a fully Bayesian approach. RESULTS: Out of 959 confirmed cases, 642 (67%) were males and 317 (33%) had died. Three hundred and sixty four (38%) cases occurred in Ar Riyad province, while 325 (34%) cases occurred in Makkah. Individuals with some comorbidity had a significantly higher likelihood of dying from MERS-CoV compared with those who did not suffer comorbidity [Odds ratio (OR) = 2.071; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.307, 3.263]. Health-care workers were significantly less likely to die from the disease compared with non-health workers [OR = 0.372, 95% CI: 0.151, 0.827]. Patients who had fatal clinical experience and those with clinical and subclinical experiences were equally less likely to die from the disease compared with patients who did not have fatal clinical experience and those without clinical and subclinical experiences respectively. The odds of dying from the disease was found to increase as age increased beyond 25 years and was much higher for individuals with any underlying comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Interventions to minimize mortality from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus should particularly focus individuals with comorbidity, non-health-care workers, patients with no clinical fatal experience, and patients without any clinical and subclinical experiences.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adegboye, Oyelola A.; Gayawan, Ezra; Hanna, Fahad","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39fae6df128e98e970b22ea35cebdaaac78a647e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5536289.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759623/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia","Makkah"],"keyphrases":["Patients","fatal clinical experience","clinical fatal experience","non-health-care workers","non-health workers","human contact","Individuals","comorbidity","subclinical experiences","disease","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak","health care facilities","contagious respiratory pathogen","close contact","confirmed cases","higher likelihood","Odds ratio","spatial variation","account","individual level risk factors","mortality","retrospective analysis","binary outcomes","families","BACKGROUND","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","Geoadditive variable model","study","Bayesian approach","Ar Riyad province","infected subject","Interventions","years","underlying comorbidities","animal","MERS-CoV","DATA","METHODS","CONCLUSION","confidence interval","RESULTS","age","Transmission","Makkah","males"],"language":"en"},

Factors determining severity of disease in previously healthy infants are still unclear. It was hypothesized that disease severity is correlated with viral load in primary RSV infection. Infants of a healthy birth cohort were included at signs of their first respiratory tract infection. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained within 48\u201396 hr and disease severity was assessed with a previously published severity scoring model. PCR was applied to test the aspirates in a semi\u2010quantitative way for the presence of 10 respiratory pathogens. In case of multiple infection, the pathogen with the highest load was defined as the primary pathogen. The correlation between disease severity and viral load was analyzed. A total of 82 infants were included over a period of 2 years. Median age at first respiratory tract infection was 3 months. Pathogens were detected in 77 (94%) infants; more than one pathogen was detected in 35 (43%) infants. RSV was present in aspirates of 30 infants; in 16 aspirates RSV was the primary pathogen. A negative correlation between RSV CT\u2010value and disease severity was found in all RSV cases (\u03C1 = \u22120.52, P = 0.003) and in cases with RSV as the primary pathogen (\u03C1 = \u22120.54, P = 0.03).

The burden of influenza is very heavy. Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that annual epidemics affect 5-15% of the world\u0027s population, causing up to 4-5 million severe cases and from 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. In order to design anti-influenza molecules and compounds, it is important to understand the complex replication cycle of the influenza virus. Replication is achieved through various stages. First, the virus must engage the sialic acid receptors present on the free surface of the cells of the respiratory tract. The virus can then enter the cells by different routes (clathrin-mediated endocytosis or CME, caveolae-dependent endocytosis or CDE, clathrin-caveolae-independent endocytosis, or macropinocytosis). CME is the most usual pathway; the virus is internalized into an endosomal compartment, from which it must emerge in order to release its nucleic acid into the cytosol. The ribonucleoprotein must then reach the nucleus in order to begin the process of translation of its genes and to transcribe and replicate its nucleic acid. Subsequently, the RNA segments, surrounded by the nucleoproteins, must migrate to the cell membrane in order to enable viral assembly. Finally, the virus must be freed to invade other cells of the respiratory tract. All this is achieved through a synchronized action of molecules that perform multiple enzymatic and catalytic reactions, currently known only in part, and for which many inhibitory or competitive molecules have been studied. Some of these studies have led to the development of drugs that have been approved, such as Amantadine, Rimantadine, Oseltamivir, Zanamivir, Peramivir, Laninamivir, Ribavirin and Arbidol. This review focuses on the influenza lifecycle and on the currently available drugs, while potential antiviral compounds for the prevention and treatment of influenza are considered in the subsequent review.","publish_time":"2014-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"GASPARINI, R.; AMICIZIA, D.; LAI, PL.; BRAGAZZI, NL.; PANATTO, D.","journal":"J Prev Med Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d843363f9656abc2037bd77bd018dcbbd541d849.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4718311.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4718311/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CME","CDE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","order","treatment of influenza","influenza lifecycle","burden of influenza","anti-influenza molecules","respiratory tract","cells","nucleic acid","clathrin-caveolae","clathrin-mediated endocytosis","caveolae-dependent endocytosis","independent endocytosis","CME","competitive molecules","contagious respiratory acute viral disease","synchronized action of molecules","viral assembly","sialic acid receptors present","available drugs","development of drugs","subsequent review","potential antiviral compounds","complex replication cycle","high fever","short incubation period","Zanamivir","Peramivir","free surface","CDE","estimates","Oseltamivir","Laninamivir","prevention","different routes","Rimantadine","Ribavirin","systemic symptoms","cell membrane","catalytic reactions","process of translation","World Health Organization","nucleoproteins","Amantadine","Arbidol","nucleus","macropinocytosis","usual pathway","annual epidemics","RNA segments","genes","various stages","endosomal compartment","cytosol","severe cases","world\u0027s population","deaths","studies","ribonucleoprotein"],"language":"en"},

Hence, this review provides an overview of the significant bacterial, viral and fungal EIDs and RIDs in Iran regarding their epidemiological aspects.","publish_time":"2017-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parhizgari, Najmeh; Gouya, Mohammad Mehdi; Mostafavi, Ehsan","journal":"Iran J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33c50b9e506abf3c1db6bf58bd77b97155f9e903.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5719507.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5719507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["increased reports of emerging infectious diseases","drug resistant diseases","Iran","fungal EIDs","poor public health conditions","serious public health problems","agricultural development","development of preventive","significant leading causes of morbidity","various geographical areas","various types of geographic properties","international travels","ecological alterations","unstable political situations","behaviors","susceptibility","substantial climatic variability","neighboring countries","humans\u2019 demographics","mortality","overview","strategies","Changes","epidemiological aspects","review"],"language":"en"},

This information is of particular relevance since the T2 pseudoknot has been considered a representative of a large family of RNA pseudoknots related by a common structural motif, previously referred to as \u0027common pseudoknot motif 1\u0027 or CPK1. In the work presented here, a mutated sequence with the potential to form a pseudoknot with a 6 bp stem2 was shown to adopt a pseudoknot structure similar to that of the wild-type sequence. This result is significant in that it demonstrates that pseudoknots with 6 bp in stem2 and a single nucleotide in loop1 are indeed feasible. Mutated sequences with the potential to form pseudoknots with either 5 or 8 bp in stem2 yielded NMR spectra that could not confirm the formation of a pseudoknot structure. Replacing the adenosine nucleotide in loop1 of the wild-type pseudoknot with any one of G, C or U did not significantly alter the pseudoknot structure. Taken together, the results of this study provide support for the existence of a family of similarly structured pseudoknots with two coaxially stacked stems, either 6 or 7 bp in stem2, and a single nucleotide in loop1. This family includes many of the pseudoknots predicted to occur downstream of the frameshift or readthrough sites in a significant number of viral RNAs.","publish_time":"1997-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Z; Hoffman, D W","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC146565/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T2 pseudoknot","similar pseudoknot structure","pseudoknot structure similar","wild-type pseudoknot","common pseudoknot motif","bp stem2","structured pseudoknots","loop1","large family of RNA pseudoknots","single nucleotide","adenosine nucleotide","wild-type sequence","Mutated sequences","potential","common structural motif","messenger RNA of bacteriophage T2","range of sequences","NMR spectra","NMR methods","significant number of viral RNAs","gene","loop lengths","representative","readthrough sites","support","existence","purpose","particular relevance","stacked stems","study","frameshift","series of mutants","CPK1","results","information","work"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have identified two important RNA signals for frameshifting, the slippery sequence and a downstream stem\u2013loop structure. However, there have been somewhat conflicting reports concerning the individual contributions of these sequences. In this study we have performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of the cis-acting RNA sequences involved in HIV-1 gag\u2013pol and HTLV-2 gag\u2013pro frameshifting. Using an in vitro translation system we determined frameshifting efficiencies for shuffled HIV-1/HTLV-2 RNA elements in a background of HIV-1 or HTLV-2 sequences. We show that the ability of the slippery sequence and stem\u2013loop to promote ribosomal frameshifting is influenced by the flanking upstream sequence and the nucleotides in the spacer element. A wide range of frameshift efficiency rates was observed for both viruses when shuffling single sequence elements. The results for HIV-1/HTLV-2 chimeric constructs represent strong evidence supporting the notion that the viral wild-type sequences are not designed for maximal frameshifting activity but are optimized to a level suited to efficient viral replication.","publish_time":"2001-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yang-Gyun; Maas, Stefan; Rich, Alexander","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC29715/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HTLV","viral RNA","translational frameshifting","frameshifting efficiencies","ribosomal frameshifting","pro frameshifting","slippery sequence","RNA elements","shuffled HIV","background of HIV","viral wild-type sequences","maximal frameshifting activity","cis-acting RNA sequences","single sequence elements","important RNA signals","Human immunodeficiency virus type","flanking upstream sequence","gag gene","human T cell leukemia virus type","efficient viral replication","downstream stem","loop structure","notion","termination codon","nucleotides","strong evidence","viruses","end","comprehensive mutational analysis","wide range of frameshift efficiency rates","chimeric constructs","level","individual contributions","pol","Previous studies","translation system","similar mechanism","conflicting reports","ability","spacer element","study","results"],"language":"en"},

A new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has recently been developed that targets the spike protein region of the FIP virus (FIPV) and can identify specific mutations (M1030L or S1032A), the presence of which indicates a shift from feline enteric coronavirus (FeCV) to FIPV. This test will only be useful in the geographical region of interest, however, if the FIP viruses contain these mutations. The primary objective of this study was to determine the presence of the M1030L or S1032A mutations in FeCV derived from stool samples from a selected group of healthy cats from households and shelters and determine how many of these cats excrete FeCV. The secondary objective was to evaluate how often these specific FIPV mutations were present in tissue samples derived from cats diagnosed with FIP at postmortem examination.

METHODS The clinical data of 48 patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted in Jinhua Municipal Central Hospital from January 21, 2020 to March 20, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS In the 48 suspected cases, 18 were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 30 were excluded. Each of the confirmed cases were discussed among MDT for 2 to 12 times with an average of (4.7\u00B13.2) times; while for non-COVID-19 patients were discussed for 2 to 4 times with an average of (2.3\u00B10.6) times. With the guidance of MDT, one COVID-19 patient was transferred to designated provincial hospital after effective treatment; one patient complicated with acute cholecystitis underwent gallbladder puncture and drainage; and COVID-19 was excluded in a highly suspected patient after alveolar lavage fluid examination. Except one transferred patient, all 17 confirmed COVID-19 patients were cured and discharged. There was no cross-infection occurred in suspected patients during the hospitalization. There were no deaths and no medical staff infections. CONCLUSIONS The efficiency of diagnosis and treatment for suspected COVID-19 patients can be improved with MDT, particularly for complicated cases.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Shubo; Yu, Shi\u0027an; Chen, Haijun; Zhang, Dehe; Xu, Yejin; Zhu, Dan; Cheng, Kun","journal":"Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

In 2017, it was reported that physical stimuli related to massage improved finger blood flow volumes, contributing to the regeneration of damaged nerves. We developed a method of hand therapy for breast cancer patients complaining of numbness related to anticancer drug administration, and examined its effects on numbness. Hand therapy was performed by a single therapist who received lectures at the Sophia Phytotherapy College, which is accredited by the Japan Handcare Association. The fingertips to wrist, ankle, metacarpal bones, palm, and elbow were massaged using the bilateral arms/fingers for 15minutes. We investigated the influences of daily living status(Support Team Assessment Sched- ule-Japan: STAS-J), age, body mass index(BMI), severity/site of numbness, type of numbness, type of drug, duration of breast cancer, duration of numbness, and presence or absence of lymph node dissection, and evaluated the severity of numbness using a 10-cm Visual Analog Scale(VAS). The study included 51 breast cancer patients complaining of numbness of the fingers, with a mean age of 59 years. In patients with relatively mild numbness(STAS-J 1), the VAS scores before and after hand therapy were 4.7\u00B11.8 and 1.9\u00B11.3, respectively, showing a marked decrease. In STAS-J 2 patients, the values were 4.9 \u00B11.4 and 2.1\u00B11.3, respectively, also showing a marked decrease. Thus, this hand therapy reduced numbness in mild- and moderate-status patients. Statistical comparisons were performed between the STAS-J 1/2(mild/moderate numbness)and STAS-J 3/4(severe numbness)groups. Although the severity of numbness was not correlated with age, BMI, type of drug, lymph node dissection, or duration of breast cancer, the proportion of patients with a B1-year history of numbness was significantly larger in the STAS-J 1/2 group. The most frequent site of numbness was from the proximal interphalangeal joints to the fingertips. Concerning the severity of numbness, many patients complained of severe numbness, as represented by that after sitting straight. These results suggest that this hand therapy is effective for reducing numbness in patients receiving taxanes and complaining of mild to moderate numbness.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sasaki, Akiko; Ikeda, Akiko; Tsunoda, Yuko; Sawada, Terumasa; Tsurutani, Junji; Tatsuo, Tokito; Kiuchi, Yuji; Nakamura, Seigo","journal":"Gan to kagaku ryoho.

This report opens with a tribute to the late Chris McGuigan, a Past-President of ISAR, then continues with summaries of the principal invited lectures. Doug Richman (Elion Award) investigated HIV resistance, Bob Vince (Hol\u00FD Award) showed how carbocyclic nucleoside analogs led to abacavir and Jerome Deval (Prusoff Award) explained how his group chose to seek a nucleoside analog to treat RSV. ALS-8176 was active in a human RSV-challenge study and is being evaluated in children. The first keynote address, by Richard H. Scheuermann, reported on the remarkable progress made in viral genomics. The second keynote address, by Heinz Feldmann, gave an overview of Ebola virus disease. There were four mini-symposia, Structural Biology, Diagnostic Technologies, DNA viruses and Zika virus. Diagnostic assays are approaching an ideal aim, a compact instrument, simple to use with any type of sample, no sample preparation and a result within an hour. The diversity of HCMV is far greater than for other herpesviruses, typically, an individual having \u003E20,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). During antiviral treatment, there is rapid CMV evolution which is presumed to be due to preferential selection of already present variants rather than by the creation of new variants. A selection of contributor presentations includes oral prodrugs for nucleoside triphosphate analogs, a new method for the synthesis of phosphoramidate prodrugs and the clinical evaluation of brincidofovir for treating transplant recipients with adenovirus infections.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vere Hodge, R.

We performed analytical and clinical validations of these kits. METHODS: PowerChek (Kogene Biotech, Korea), DiaPlexQ (SolGent, Korea), Anyplex (Seegene, Korea), AccuPower (Bioneer, Korea), LightMix (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Switzerland), and UltraFast kits (Nanobiosys, Korea) were evaluated. Limits of detection (LOD) with 95% probability values were estimated by testing 16 replicates of upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) RNA transcripts. Specificity was estimated by using 28 nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for other respiratory viruses. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using 18 lower respiratory specimens. The sensitivity test panel and the high inhibition panel were composed of nine specimens each, including eight and six specimens that were positive for MERS-CoV, respectively. RESULTS: The LODs for upE ranged from 21.88 to 263.03 copies/reaction, and those for ORF1a ranged from 6.92 to 128.82 copies/reaction. No cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses was found. All six kits correctly identified 8 of 8 (100%) positive clinical specimens. Based on results from the high inhibition panel, PowerChek and AccuPower were the least sensitive to the presence of PCR inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of all six assay systems were sufficient for diagnosing MERS-CoV infection. However, the analytical sensitivity and detection ability in specimens with PCR inhibition could be improved with the use of appropriate internal controls.","publish_time":"2016-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Mi-Na; Ko, Young Jin; Seong, Moon-Woo; Kim, Jae-Seok; Shin, Bo-Moon; Sung, Heungsup","journal":"Ann Lab Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/357fe51849c655d37552b3f96c67be8394a9b6e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4940488.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3343/alm.2016.36.5.450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27374710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Roche Molecular Diagnostics"],"locations":["Middle East","Korea"],"keyphrases":["Korea","positive clinical specimens","Clinical sensitivity","lower respiratory specimens","high inhibition panel","analytical sensitivity","respiratory viruses","different commercial MERS-CoV RNA detection kits","presence of PCR inhibition","sensitivity test panel","diagnosing MERS-CoV infection","UltraFast kits","overall sensitivity","detection ability","rRT-PCR","upE","PowerChek","Limits of detection","AccuPower","ORF1a","Specificity","RESULTS","clinical validations","copies","outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","RNA transcripts","real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","Switzerland","LightMix","envelope gene","assay systems","open reading frame","Roche Molecular Diagnostics","Kogene Biotech","DiaPlexQ","replicates of upstream","Anyplex","SolGent","Seegene","Bioneer","use of appropriate internal controls","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","cross-reactivity","nasopharyngeal swabs","Nanobiosys","probability values","LODs","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

RNA secondary structure prediction and comparison software programs were implemented to construct our two-stage strategy for the IRSS. Two software programs formed the backbone of IRSS: the RNAL fold program, used to predict local RNA secondary structures by minimum free energy method; and the RNA Align program, used to compare predicted structures. After complete viral genome database search, the IRSS have low error rate and up to 72.3% sensitivity in appropriated parameters. CONCLUSION: IRSS is freely available at this website . In addition, all source codes, precompiled binaries, examples and documentations are downloadable for local execution.

How passive viral substances convert to active substances, comprising viral replication and assembly compartments has been of intense interest to virologists, cell and molecular biologists and immunologists. Infection starts with virus entry into a susceptible cell and delivers the viral genome to the replication site. This is a multi-step process, and involves the cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins. Likewise, the egress of progeny virus particles from the replication site to the extracellular space is enhanced by the cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins. This overcomes the limitation of thermal diffusion, and transports virions and virion components, often in association with cellular organelles. This review explores how the analysis of viral trajectories informs about mechanisms of infection. We discuss the methodology enabling researchers to visualize single virions in cells by fluorescence imaging and tracking. Virus visualization and tracking are increasingly enhanced by computational analyses of virus trajectories as well as in silico modeling. Combined approaches reveal previously unrecognized features of virus-infected cells. Using select examples of complementary methodology, we highlight the role of actin filaments and microtubules, and their associated motors in virus infections. In-depth studies of single virion dynamics at high temporal and spatial resolutions thereby provide deep insight into virus infection processes, and are a basis for uncovering underlying mechanisms of how cells function.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, I-Hsuan; Burckhardt, Christoph J.; Yakimovich, Artur; Greber, Urs F.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af7e42cdc9fa098ffcfdbf92ebfb9dbd4dbde545.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5923460.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5923460/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus entry","virus infections","Virus visualization","virus infection processes","viral replication","passive viral substances","passive substances","active substances","infected cells","unrecognized features of virus","egress of progeny virus particles","computational analyses of virus trajectories","viral genome","replication site","cells function","mechanisms of infection","analysis of viral trajectories","associated motor proteins","single virions","cytoskeleton","associated motors","tracking","virion components","transports virions","susceptible cell","underlying mechanisms","In-depth studies of single virion dynamics","chemical energy transformation","examples of complementary methodology","spatial resolutions","high temporal","deep insight","microtubules","fluorescence imaging","dual nature","assembly compartments","role of actin filaments","association","molecular biologists","virologists","limitation of thermal diffusion","basis","extracellular space","researchers","Combined approaches","immunologists","Viruses","multi-step process","cellular organelles","silico modeling","review"],"language":"en"},

Demographic and clinical data of patients infected with different HPIV were compared. We used a hemi-nested PCR approach to generate viral genome sequences from HPIV-positive samples and conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. In total, 170 samples tested positive for HPIV. HPIV3 was most commonly detected in our cohort and 80 co-detections of HPIV with other respiratory viruses were found. Phylogenetic analyses suggest local endemic circulation as well as punctuated introductions of new HPIV lineages. Viral gene flow analysis revealed that Viet Nam is a net importer of viral genetic diversity. Epidemiological analyses imply similar disease severity for all HPIV species. HPIV sequences from Viet Nam formed local clusters and were interspersed with sequences from diverse geographic regions.

Amino acid-based drugs are a group of biologic-based therapeutics that can effectively combat the diseases caused by drug resistance or molecular deficiency. Computational techniques play a key role to design and develop the amino acid-based therapeutics such as proteins, peptides and peptidomimetics. In this study, it was attempted to discuss the various elements for computational design of amino acid-based therapeutics. Protein design seeks to identify the properties of amino acid sequences that fold to predetermined structures with desirable structural and functional characteristics. Peptide drugs occupy a middle space between proteins and small molecules and it is hoped that they can target \u201Cundruggable\u201D intracellular protein\u2013protein interactions. Peptidomimetics, the compounds that mimic the biologic characteristics of peptides, present refined pharmacokinetic properties compared to the original peptides. Here, the elaborated techniques that are developed to characterize the amino acid sequences consistent with a specific structure and allow protein design are discussed. Moreover, the key principles and recent advances in currently introduced computational techniques for rational peptide design are spotlighted.

The main purpose of the present study is to investigate GALT induced cross-protection between different APP serotypes and elucidate key mechanisms of the immune response to GALT antigenic stimulation. Bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that galT is a highly conserved gene in APP, widely distributed across multiple pathogenic strains. Homologies between any two strains ranges from 78.9% to 100% regarding the galT locus. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) confirmed that GALT specific antibodies could not be induced by inactivated APP L20 or MS71 whole cell bacterin preparations. A recombinant fusion GALT protein derived from APP L20, however has proven to be an effective cross-protective antigen against APP sevorar 1 MS71 (50%, 4/8) and APP sevorar 5b L20 (75%, 6/8). Histopathological examinations have confirmed that recombinant GALT vaccinated animals showed less severe pathological signs in lung tissues than negative controls after APP challenge. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis indicated that the infiltration of neutrophils in the negative group is significantly increased compared with that in the normal control (P\u003C0.001) and that in surviving animals is decreased compared to the negative group. Anti-GALT antibodies were shown to mediate phagocytosis of neutrophils. After interaction with anti-GALT antibodies, survival rate of APP challenged vaccinated animals was significantly reduced (P\u003C0.001).

To capture the full range of the psychological impact of natural disasters, we examined the buffering effects of social support on depressive symptoms and cluster\u2010specific PTSD symptoms, with consideration of displacement status. In a survey conducted 18 to 24 months after Hurricane Katrina, 810 adults exposed to the disaster reported the number of Katrina\u2010related traumatic events experienced, perceived social support 2 months post\u2010Katrina, and cluster\u2010specific PTSD and depressive symptoms experienced since Katrina.

This makes addressing health disparities and health inequities in minority populations increasingly more difficult. Minority populations, including those who classify themselves as African American and Hispanic, are using mobile phones to access health information via the internet more frequently than those who classify themselves as white, providing unique opportunities for those in public health and health education to reach these traditionally underserved populations using mobile health (mHealth) interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to assess studies conducted in the United States that have used mHealth tools and strategies to develop and implement interventions in underserved populations. This review also examines the ways in which mHealth strategies are being employed in public health interventions to these priority population groups, as mobile phone capabilities include text messaging, mobile apps, internet access, emails, video streaming, social media, instant messaging, and more. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using key search phrases, the matrix method, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flowchart diagram to identify key studies conducted between the years of 2009-2016 in the United States. These studies were reviewed for their use of mHealth interventions in historically underserved and minority populations. RESULTS: A total of 16,270 articles were initially identified using key search phrases in three databases. Titles were reviewed and articles not meeting criteria were excluded, leaving 156 articles for further review. After additional review for relevance and inclusion criteria, 16 articles were qualified and analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth is a promising area of development for public health and health education. While successful research has been done using text messaging (short message service, SMS) and other mHealth strategies, there is a need for more research using mobile phones and tablet applications. This literature review demonstrates mHealth technology has the ability to increase prevention and health education in health disparate communities and concludes that more specified research is needed.","publish_time":"2018-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anderson-Lewis, Charkarra; Darville, Gabrielle; Mercado, Rebeccah Eve; Howell, Savannah; Di Maggio, Samantha","journal":"JMIR Mhealth Uhealth","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6028762.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6028762/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzEwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["mobile health","health education","health inequities","health disparities","health information","public health interventions","mHealth strategies","health disparate communities","mHealth technology","mHealth tools","use of mHealth interventions","minority populations","articles","underserved populations","mobile phones","additional review","systematic literature review","mobile apps","key studies","United States","text messaging","mobile phone capabilities","key search phrases","instant messaging","internet access","specified research","successful research","OBJECTIVE","Systematic Reviews","inclusion criteria","ethnic groups","priority population groups","emails","video streaming","Meta-Analyses flowchart diagram","Preferred Reporting Items","matrix method","promising area of development","social media","SMS","prevention","ability","short message service","relevance","need","proportion of people","members","unique opportunities","tablet applications","CONCLUSIONS","databases","METHODS","ways","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","total","years","Titles"],"language":"en"},

In this essay, we illustrate how a judicious integration of optogenetics with routine methods can illuminate the host\u2013pathogen interactions in a way that has not been feasible otherwise.","publish_time":"2018-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arroyo-Olarte, Ruben Dario; Thurow, Laura; Kozjak-Pavlovic, Vera; Gupta, Nishith","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f67a850db06d9b9e3f63d9943e2b1fc5a72ca8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6042787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6042787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzEyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["judicious integration of optogenetics","selected aspects of optogenetics","subsequent evolution of optogenetics","potential applications","wider applications","parasites","intracellular pathogens","routine methods","host","long-standing questions","infection biology","dimension of current research","way","entwined models","viruses","bacteria","pathogen interactions","unprecedented advancement","understanding","tool","outstanding success","birth","brain"],"language":"en"},

However, the detailed evolutionary history and impact of tRNA modifying enzymes has not been analyzed. Using ancestral reconstruction of five tRNA modifications across 1093 bacteria, we show that most modifications were ancestral to eubacteria, but were repeatedly lost in many lineages. Most modification losses coincided with evolutionary shifts in nontarget tRNAs, often driven by increased bias in genomic GC and associated codon use, or by genome reduction. In turn, the loss of tRNA modifications stabilized otherwise highly dynamic tRNA gene repertoires. Our work thus traces the complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications, providing the first clear evidence for their role in the evolution of bacterial translation.","publish_time":"2018-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diwan, Gaurav D; Agashe, Deepa","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e213ce275307f241723cf26bcb756dcba2a6b5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6063277.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6063277/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzEzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["loss of tRNA modifications","impact of tRNA","complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications","nontarget tRNAs","dynamic tRNA gene repertoires","evolution of bacterial translation","translation efficiency","enzymes","detailed evolutionary history","key aspect of translation","evolutionary shifts","ancestral reconstruction","associated codon use","genomic GC","increased bias","anticodon bases","role","wobble pairing","cover","clear evidence","genome reduction","modification losses","multiple codons","tree of life","turn","work","accuracy","eubacteria","lineages"],"language":"en"},

Patients\u2019 samples were screened by real-time RT-PCR and influenza viruses isolated were characterized antigenically by haemagglutination inhibition assay and genetically by sequencing of HA and NA genes. RESULTS: 32% (397/1248) of ILI and 29% (581/1997) of SARI patients tested were positive for influenza viruses. In 2014\u20132015 the median week of influenza detection was week 7/2015 with B/Yamagata lineage viruses dominating (79%); in 2015\u20132016\u2014week 5/2016 was the median with A/H1N1pdm09 viruses prevailing (83%); and in 2016\u20132017 a bimodal distribution of influenza activity was observed\u2014the first wave was caused by A/H3N2 (55%) with median week 51/2016 and the second by B/Victoria lineage viruses (45%) with median week 9/2017. For ILI, influenza virus detection was highest in children aged 5\u201314 years while for SARI patients most were aged \u003E15 years and 27 (4.6%) of 581 SARI cases died during the three seasons. Persons aged 30\u201364 years had the highest risk of fatal outcome, notably those infected with A/H1N1pdm09 (OR 11.41, CI 3.94\u201333.04, p\u003C0.001). A/H1N1pdm09 viruses analyzed by gene sequencing fell into genetic groups 6B and 6B.1; A/H3N2 viruses belonged to genetic subclades 3C.3b, 3C.3a, 3C.2a and 3C.2a1; B/Yamagata lineage viruses were of clade 3 and B/Victoria lineage viruses fell in clade1A. CONCLUSION: In Georgia influenza virus activity occurred mainly from December through March in all seasons, with varying peak weeks and predominating viruses. Around one third of ILI/ SARI cases were associated with influenza caused by antigenically and genetically distinct influenza viruses over the course of the three seasons.","publish_time":"2018-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Machablishvili, Ann; Chakhunashvili, Giorgi; Zakhashvili, Khatuna; Karseladze, Irakli; Tarkhan-Mouravi, Olgha; Gavashelidze, Mari; Jashiashvili, Tamar; Sabadze, Lela; Imnadze, Paata; Daniels, Rodney S.; Ermetal, Burcu; McCauley, John W.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01669153236899edec9fff5fc4fb19a742c3dfef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6063423.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6063423/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzEzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza Like Illness","SARI","HA","NA","ILI"],"locations":["Georgia","Victoria"],"keyphrases":["influenza seasons","distinct influenza viruses","H1N1pdm09 viruses","H3N2 viruses","Influenza epidemiological","predominating viruses","present Influenza","Yamagata lineage viruses","Victoria lineage viruses","median week of influenza detection","influenza virus detection","Georgia influenza virus activity","SARI data","bimodal distribution of influenza activity","SARI patients","SARI cases","years","sentinel site ILI","surveillance data","virologic data","gene sequencing","sequencing of HA","genetic groups","genetic subclades","highest risk of fatal outcome","Severe Acute Respiratory Infection","real-time RT-PCR","varying peak weeks","Illness","children","2a1","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","course","haemagglutination inhibition assay","country","Patients\u2019 samples","NA genes","METHODS","clade1A","wave","Persons","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Globally, high-consequence pathogens that impact livestock and have the potential for human transmission create research paradoxes and operational challenges for the high-containment laboratories that conduct work with them. These specialized facilities are required for conducting all phases of research on high-consequence pathogens (basic, applied, and translational) with an emphasis on both the generation of fundamental knowledge and product development. To achieve this research mission, a highly-trained workforce is required and flexible operational methods are needed. In addition, working with certain pathogens requires compliance with regulations such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agent regulations, which adds to the operational burden. The vast experience from the existing studies at Plum Island Animal Disease Center, other U.S. laboratories, and those in Europe and Australia with biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities designed for large animals, clearly demonstrates the valuable contribution this capability brings to the efforts to detect, prepare, prevent and respond to livestock and potential zoonotic threats. To raise awareness of these challenges, which include biosafety and biosecurity issues, we held a workshop at the 2018 American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Biothreats conference to further discuss the topic with invited experts and audience participants. The workshop covered the subjects of research funding and metrics, economic sustainment of drug and vaccine development pipelines, workforce turnover, and the challenges of maintaining operational readiness of high containment laboratories.","publish_time":"2018-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michelotti, Julia M.; Yeh, Kenneth B.; Beckham, Tammy R.; Colby, Michelle M.; Dasgupta, Debanjana; Zuelke, Kurt A.; Olinger, Gene G.","journal":"Trop Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d9b9c94e5b2cd4016b42cdc8fbcb85fa908bc64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6073383.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073383/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Centers for Disease Control","CDC","U.S. Department of Agriculture","Plum Island Animal Disease Center"],"locations":["U.S.","Europe","Australia"],"keyphrases":["operational challenges","high-consequence pathogens","high-containment laboratories","operational readiness of high containment laboratories","research paradoxes","phases of research","research mission","operational burden","subjects of research funding","zoonotic diseases","flexible operational methods","certain pathogens","workshop","potential zoonotic threats","workforce turnover","trained workforce","product development","Disease Control","impact livestock","large animals","Agent regulations","biosafety level","specialized facilities","vaccine development pipelines","emerging infectious diseases","Plum Island Animal Disease Center","existing studies","economic sustainment of drug","percent of new","topic","metrics","estimates","human transmission","humans account","Microbiology","ASM","Centers","generation of fundamental knowledge","Biothreats conference","American Society","invited experts","audience participants","valuable contribution","USDA","Australia","CDC","BSL","Europe","compliance","vast experience","Department of Agriculture","biosecurity issues","World Health Organization","capability","emphasis","efforts","addition","awareness"],"language":"en"},

However, its effectiveness in preventing acute respiratory illness (ARI) during field training in military training facilities has been not studied. A quasi-interventional study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of ARIs over 4 weeks in a Korean army training center in South Korea from January 2009 to February 2009. A total of 1291 recruits participating in military training for 4 weeks were randomly distributed to 2 battalions (one with 631 and the other with 660). After noticing there is a difference between the 2 battalions in terms of the development of ARIs at the end of 2 weeks of training, we conducted interviews with the battle commanders to determine factors that may be related to one battalion having a higher incidence of ARI. Thereafter, we performed an intervention, which consists of instructing the battalion having a higher incidence of ARI to implement field hand washing from the third week. Following the intervention, we compared the cumulative rate of ARI during 4 weeks of training. The interviews revealed that there were no major differences between the 2 battalions in terms of the training schedules, living environments, or indoor hand washing methods. However, there was difference in terms of hand washing during field training for the first 2 weeks; whereas one battalion (the early hand washing group) implemented hand washing during field training starting in the first week, the other battalion did not implement hand washing for the first 2 weeks but instead began in the third week (the late hand washing group). The cumulative incidence rate of ARI during 4 weeks of training was significantly lower in the early hand washing group (13.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.6%\u201315.9%) than in the late hand washing group (28.0%, 95% CI, 24.7%\u201331.5%). Our study suggests that outdoor hand washing during field training may be an effective precaution for reducing ARI incidence among recruits participating in military training.","publish_time":"2018-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ho Seung; Ko, Ryoung Eun; Ji, Misuk; Lee, Ju-Hyung; Lee, Chang-Seop; Lee, Hyun","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d50ec2ab542eef07b9df564017f4c537e1c5d13a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6078659.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078659/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARI"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["weeks of training","field hand washing","field training","terms of hand washing","outdoor hand washing","early hand washing group","late hand washing group","training schedules","indoor hand washing methods","military training facilities","ARI incidence","higher incidence of ARI","Korean army training center","cumulative incidence rate of ARI","cumulative rate of ARI","battalions","recruits","interviews","respiratory infection","development of ARIs","prevalence of ARIs","acute respiratory illness","quasi-interventional study","environments","effective precaution","South Korea","key role","end","battle commanders","clinical settings","effectiveness","major differences","factors","confidence interval","total"],"language":"en"},

This is a severe, often fatal illness with mortality rates varying from 50 to 90% in humans. Although the virus and associated disease has been recognized since 1976, it was only when the recent outbreak of EBOV in 2014\u20132016 highlighted the danger and global impact of this virus, necessitating the need for coming up with the effective vaccines and drugs to counter its pandemic threat. Albeit no commercial vaccine is available so far against EBOV, a few vaccine candidates are under evaluation and clinical trials to assess their prophylactic efficacy. These include recombinant viral vector (recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector, chimpanzee adenovirus type 3-vector, and modified vaccinia Ankara virus), Ebola virus-like particles, virus-like replicon particles, DNA, and plant-based vaccines. Due to improvement in the field of genomics and proteomics, epitope-targeted vaccines have gained top priority. Correspondingly, several therapies have also been developed, including immunoglobulins against specific viral structures small cell-penetrating antibody fragments that target intracellular EBOV proteins. Small interfering RNAs and oligomer-mediated inhibition have also been verified for EVD treatment. Other treatment options include viral entry inhibitors, transfusion of convalescent blood/serum, neutralizing antibodies, and gene expression inhibitors. Repurposed drugs, which have proven safety profiles, can be adapted after high-throughput screening for efficacy and potency for EVD treatment.

Within PPs, Dendritic cells (DCs) can uptake antigens from the gut lumen by extending dendrites into epithelium, and process it and then present to lymphocytes, which effectively antigen produces an immune response. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric viral disease. The interaction between inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) has been reported. However, little is known about the interaction between inactivated PEDV and DCs in porcine PPs. RESULTS: In this study, for the first time we investigated the role of DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration inactivated PEDV. Firstly, a method to isolate DCs from porcine PPs was established, in which the purity of SWC3a(\u002B)/MHC-II(\u002B) DCs was more than 90%. Our findings clearly indicate that DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration of inactivated PEDV not only stimulated the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes, but also secreted cytokines (IL-1, IL-4). Furthermore, the number of DCs and IgA(\u002B) cells in porcine intestinal mucosal significantly increased and the levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibody in the serum and SIgA antibody in the feces increased after oral administration inactivated PEDV. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that oral administration of inactivated PEDV activate DCs in porcine Peyer\u2019s patches and inactivated PEDV may be a useful and safe vaccine to trigger adaptive immunity.","publish_time":"2018-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Chen; Zhang, En; Huang, Lulu; Wang, Jialu; Yang, Qian","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97b03849d178cb08d39be44ebab0a2aa41b6a4d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6097195.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6097195/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine PPs","oral administration inactivated PEDV","oral administration of inactivated PEDV","inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","Mo-DCs","role of DCs","number of DCs","porcine Peyer\u2019s patches","causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea","porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells","levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibody","interaction","findings","IL","SIgA antibody","immune site","immune response","proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes","serum","feces","uptake antigens","gut lumen","safe vaccine","secreted cytokines","dendrites","epithelium","contagious enteric viral disease","adaptive immunity","process","time","BACKGROUND","method","study","intestine","MHC","CONCLUSIONS","purity of SWC3a","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Methods: This 4-year retrospective study involved 613 at-risk patients who had either hematological disorders or other immunosuppressive conditions, notably solid organ transplants. Thirty-five patients had proven/probable aspergillosis and thirteen had chronic non-invasive aspergillosis. We compared PCR, galactomannan index and mycological analysis of BAL. Results: For invasive aspergillosis (IA), PCR performed in BAL yielded 88.6% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity. Comparatively, galactomannan index and mycological examination yielded only 56.3 and 63.6% sensitivity and 97.6 and 94.5% specificity, respectively. Considering the 13 chronic aspergillosis cases, PCR, galactomannan index and mycological examination yielded 76.9, 15.4, and 84.6% sensitivity and 92.2, 94.9, and 93% specificity, respectively. Fungal load in BAL evaluated by PCR was able to discriminate between aspergillosis and contamination, but not between invasive and non-invasive forms. Finally, fungal load was predictive of 90-day mortality, with 23.1% mortality for patients with less than 500 copies/mL versus 68.4% for patients above that cut-off (p \u003C 0.05).

Hence, targeting dsRNAs through major-groove triplex formation is a promising strategy for the development of chemical probes and potential therapeutics. Short (e.g., 6\u201310 mer) chemically-modified Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNAs) have been developed that bind to dsRNAs sequence specifically at physiological conditions. For example, a PNA incorporating a modified base thio-pseudoisocytosine (L) has an enhanced recognition of a G\u2013C pair in an RNA duplex through major-groove L\u00B7G\u2013C base triple formation at physiological pH, with reduced pH dependence as observed for C(\u002B)\u00B7G\u2013C base triple formation. Currently, an unmodified T base is often incorporated into PNAs to recognize a Watson\u2013Crick A\u2013U pair through major-groove T\u00B7A\u2013U base triple formation. A substitution of the 5-methyl group in T by hydrogen and halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br, and I) causes a decrease of the pK(a) of N3 nitrogen atom, which may result in improved hydrogen bonding in addition to enhanced base stacking interactions. Here, we synthesized a series of PNAs incorporating uracil and halouracils, followed by binding studies by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism, and thermal melting. Our results suggest that replacing T with uracil and halouracils may enhance the recognition of an A\u2013U pair by PNA\u00B7RNA(2) triplex formation in a sequence-dependent manner, underscoring the importance of local stacking interactions. Incorporating bromouracils and chlorouracils into a PNA results in a significantly reduced pH dependence of triplex formation even for PNAs containing C bases, likely due to an upshift of the apparent pK(a) of N3 atoms of C bases. Thus, halogenation and other chemical modifications may be utilized to enhance hydrogen bonding of the adjacent base triples and thus triplex formation. Furthermore, our experimental and computational modelling data suggest that PNA\u00B7RNA(2) triplexes may be stabilized by incorporating a (Br)UL step but not an L(Br)U step, in dsRNA-binding PNAs.","publish_time":"2018-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patil, Kiran M; Toh, Desiree-Faye Kaixin; Yuan, Zhen; Meng, Zhenyu; Shu, Zhiyu; Zhang, Haiping; Ong, Alan Ann Lerk; Krishna, Manchugondanahalli S; Lu, Lanyuan; Lu, Yunpeng; Chen, Gang","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f633ec24c26ab3db499227405678f21cc6ab2af5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b38c12ccd389c27706fcf2a50c2274352539fbc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6125629.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125629/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C base triple formation","U base triple formation","C pair","unmodified T base","reduced pH dependence of triplex formation","RNA duplex","U pair","dsRNA-binding PNAs","major-groove T","enhanced base stacking interactions","single-stranded RNA","Double-stranded RNA","adjacent base triples","U step","N3 atoms of C bases","PNA results","series of PNAs","modified base thio-pseudoisocytosine","RNA-protein complexes","physiological pH","binding studies","improved hydrogen bonding","enhanced recognition","halouracils","dsRNAs sequence","physiological conditions","halogen atoms","importance of local stacking interactions","chemical modifications","UL step","apparent pK","structures form triplexes","development of chemical probes","sequence-dependent manner","N3 nitrogen atom","modified Peptide Nucleic Acids","non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","circular dichroism","addition","promising strategy","proteins","ssRNA","Crick","computational modelling data","methyl group","potential therapeutics","regions","Watson","thermal melting","mer","bromouracils","chlorouracils","diverse biological functions","substitution","halogenation","example","decrease"],"language":"en"},

The \u201CFree Radical Theory of Ageing\u201D (FTRA) posits that a high metabolic rate causes mitochondrial heteroplasmy and the progressive ageing phenotype. Contrary to this, bats are the longest-lived order of mammals given their small size and high metabolic rate. To investigate if bats exhibit increased mitochondrial heteroplasmy with age, we performed targeted, deep sequencing of mitogenomes and measured point heteroplasmy in wild, long lived Myotis myotis. Blood was sampled from 195 individuals, aged between \u003C1 and at 6\u002B years old, and whole mitochondria deep-sequenced, with a subset sampled over multiple years. The majority of heteroplasmies were at a low frequency and were transitions. Oxidative mutations were present in only a small number of individuals, suggesting local oxidative stress events. Cohort data showed no significant increase in heteroplasmy with age, while longitudinal data from recaptured individuals showed heteroplasmy is dynamic, and does not increase uniformly over time. We show that bats do not suffer from the predicted, inevitable increase in heteroplasmy as posited by the FRTA, instead heteroplasmy was found to be dynamic, questioning its presumed role as a primary driver of ageing.","publish_time":"2018-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jebb, David; Foley, Nicole M.; Whelan, Conor V.; Touzalin, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Puechmaille, Sebastien J.; Teeling, Emma C.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e35c915cb446555f2c019c62d4db1c1577be6e67.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6134106.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6134106/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mitochondrial heteroplasmy","measured point heteroplasmy","high metabolic rate","bats exhibit","small number of individuals","recaptured individuals","significant increase","inevitable increase","progressive ageing phenotype","primary driver of ageing","lived Myotis myotis","small size","longitudinal data","Cohort data","Free Radical Theory of Ageing","Oxidative mutations","years old","multiple years","mammals capable of true","longest-lived order of mammals","deep sequencing of mitogenomes","local oxidative stress events","FTRA","presumed role","powered flight","low frequency","subset","majority of heteroplasmies","transitions","FRTA","Blood","time"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, rapid diagnosis and immune status determination are critical for controlling IBV outbreaks. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have been widely used in the detection of IBV antibodies in the early infection and continuous infection of IB because they are more sensitive and quicker than other diagnostic methods. RESULTS: We have developed two indirect microarray methods to detect antibodies against IBV: a chemiluminescent immunoassay test (CIT) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). IBV nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) was expressed, purified from Escherichia coli, and used to spot the initiator integrated poly(dimethylsiloxane), which can provide a near \u201Czero\u201D background for serological assays. Compared with the IDEXX IBV Ab Test kit, CIT and RDT have a sensitivity and specificity of at least 98.88% and 91.67%, respectively. No cross-reaction was detected with antibodies against avian influenza virus subtypes (H5, H7, and H9), Newcastle disease virus, Marek\u2019s disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, and chicken anemia virus. The coefficients of variation of the reproducibility of the intra- and inter-assays for CIT ranged from 0.8 to 18.63%. The reproducibility of RDT was consistent with the original results. The application of the IBV nsp5 protein microarray showed that the positive rate of the CIT was 96.77%, that of the nsp5 ELISA was 91.40%, and that of the RDT was 90.32%. Furthermore, the RDT, which was visible to the naked eye, could be completed within 15 min. Our results indicated that compared with nsp5 ELISA, the CIT was more sensitive, and the RDT had similar positive rates but was faster. Furthermore, the two proposed methods were specific and stable. CONCLUSIONS: Two microarray assays, which were rapid, specific, sensitive, and relatively simple, were developed for the detection of an antibody against IBV. These methods can be of great value for the surveillance of pathogens and monitoring the efficiency of vaccination.","publish_time":"2018-09-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Liping; Hu, Jianhua; Lei, Jing; Shi, Zhiyu; Xiao, Qian; Bi, Zhenwei; Yao, Lu; Li, Yuan; Chen, Yuqing; Fang, An; Li, Hui; Song, Suquan; Liao, Min; Zhou, Jiyong","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27f21a68a6f074f434e506aee9492fa2c772847c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6142349.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6142349/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","IB","IDEXX IBV Ab","CIT","RDT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IB virus","IBV outbreaks","detection of IBV antibodies","IBV nsp5 protein microarray","reproducibility of RDT","IBV nonstructural protein","microarray assays","Marek\u2019s disease virus","Newcastle disease virus","infectious bursal disease virus","diagnostic methods","nsp5 ELISA","IDEXX IBV Ab Test kit","chicken anemia virus","rapid diagnostic test","indirect microarray methods","inter-assays","serological assays","proposed methods","avian influenza virus subtypes","continuous infection of IB","rapid diagnosis","BACKGROUND","original results","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","chemiluminescent immunoassay test","early infection","Infectious bronchitis","similar positive rates","H5","H7","immune status determination","H9","surveillance of pathogens","acute damage","great value","ELISAs","application","initiator integrated poly","dimethylsiloxane","chickens","world","sensitivity","efficiency of vaccination","coefficients of variation","naked eye","cross-reaction","specificity","CONCLUSIONS","antibody","Escherichia coli"],"language":"en"},

In Brazil, there were reports of several enteric disease outbreaks in chickens in which avian nephritis virus (ANV) was detected; however, the role of ANV in the outbreaks and whether the virus was a causative agent of these cases of enteric diseases were not determined. The aim of this study was to isolate ANV in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryonated eggs (CEE) from the enteric contents of chickens showing signs of RSS. For this purpose, 22 samples of chicken enteric contents that were positive only for ANV were inoculated into 7 and 14-day-old SPF-CEE via the yolk sac route and incubated for 5 d, with a total of 3 passages. Virus isolation was confirmed by the presence of embryo injuries, detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR, and visualization of viral particles using electron microscopy. Therefore, the 7-day-old inoculated embryos showed dwarfism, gelatinous consistency, hemorrhage, and edema in the embryos, whereas the 14-day-old did not show any alteration. Viral RNA was detected in the embryos of both ages of inoculation, and the same viral particles were visualized. The embryos from the mock group showed no alteration and were negative for all the tests. The viral cDNA was sequenced, and the molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that the Brazilian isolates are more related with the ANV-1 serotype group; the sequences of these isolates showed a high percentage of nucleotide (86.4 to 94.9%) and amino acid (92.3 to 98.7%) similarity with other sequences from China, Japan, Australia, and the United States that belong to this serotype previously classified group. In this study, we isolated 8 samples of ANV in SPF-CEE from enteric content samples from chickens with RSS.

Its high occurrence may pose a potential threat to the swine industry worldwide. The processes resulting in the emergence and spread of PCV3 remain poorly understood. Herein, the possible origin, genotypes, and evolutionary dynamics of PCV3 based on available genomic sequences are determined. The closest ancestor of PCV3 is found to be within the clade 1 bat CVs. Using different phylogenetic methods, two major genotypes are identified, PCV3a and PCV3b. It is found that the effective population size of PCV3 increased rapidly during late 2013 to early 2014 and this is associated with the diversification of PCV3a and PCV3b. A relatively high effective reproductive number (Re) value and higher evolutionary rate were found compared to other single\u2010stranded DNA viruses, and positive selection on codons 122 and 320 (24 of ORF2) is identified. It is hypothesized that this, together with the prediction of a potential change of an antigenic epitope at position 320, might have allowed PCV3 to escape from the host immune response.

Identifying biomarkers to further subdivide TNBC patients with distinct outcome is of great importance. It has been reported that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Aurora kinase A (AURKA) or Aurora kinase B (AURKB) are associated with the risk and survival of several cancers. But till now, there is no research about these polymorphisms in TNBC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated the association between polymorphisms in AURKA or AURKB gene and prognosis of TNBC patients treated with taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 273 TNBC patients were enrolled. Haploview 4.2 software was used to identify Tag SNPs. Genotyping was conducted using the MassARRAY MALDI-TOF system. RESULTS: We found that AURKA rs6099128 GG genotype carriers had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than TT\u002B TG genotype carriers (P = 0.003, HR = 12.499, 95% CI = 2.357\u201366.298).

Despite intense research, the main bat-maintenance hypothesis has not been confirmed yet. The alternative hypotheses of a non-bat maintenance host or a maintenance community including, or not, several bat and other species, deserves more investigation. However, African forest ecosystems host a large biodiversity and abound in potential maintenance hosts. How does one puzzle out? Since recent studies have revealed that several bat species have been exposed to ebolaviruses, the common denominator to these hypotheses is that within the epidemiological cycle, some bats species must be exposed to the viruses and infected by these potential alternative hosts. Under this constraint, and given the peculiar ecology of bats (roosting behaviour, habitat utilisation, and flight mode), we review the hosts and transmission pathways that can lead to bat exposure and infection to ebolaviruses. In contrast to the capacity of bats to transmit ebolaviruses and other pathogens to many hosts, our results indicate that only a limited number of hosts and pathways can lead to the transmission of ebolaviruses to bats, and that the alternative maintenance host, if it exists, must be amongst them. A list of these pathways is provided, along with protocols to prioritise and investigate these alternative hypotheses. In conclusion, taking into account the ecology of bats and their known involvement in ebolaviruses ecology drastically reduces the list of potential alternative maintenance hosts for ebolaviruses. Understanding the natural history of ebolaviruses is a health priority, and investigating these alternative hypotheses could complete the current effort focused on the role of bats.","publish_time":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caron, Alexandre; Bourgarel, Mathieu; Cappelle, Julien; Li\u00E9geois, Florian; De Nys, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne M.; Roger, Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f16da7cf7a952fb981dfc0d77280aac9c3ab933a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6213544.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213544/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ebolaviruses ecology","maintenance mechanisms of ebolaviruses","potential maintenance hosts","potential alternative hosts","alternative hypotheses","transmission of ebolaviruses","bat species","bats species","list of potential alternative maintenance hosts","non-bat maintenance host","maintenance community","main bat-maintenance hypothesis","bat exposure","role of bats","capacity of bats","peculiar ecology of bats","natural history of ebolaviruses","limited number of hosts","transmission pathways","African forest ecosystems","known involvement","roosting behaviour","large biodiversity","habitat utilisation","health priority","current effort","flight mode","results","epidemiological cycle","pathogens","indirect evidences","intense research","account","common denominator","infection","recent studies","conclusion","constraint","contrast","protocols","investigation"],"language":"en"},

However, the development of LAIV has traditionally relied on empirical methods, such as the adaptation of viruses to replicate at low temperatures. These approaches require an extensive investment of time and resources before identifying potential vaccine candidates that can be safely implemented as LAIV to protect humans. In addition, the mechanism of attenuation of these vaccines is poorly understood in some cases. Importantly, LAIV are more efficacious than inactivated vaccines because their ability to mount efficient innate and adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses. Therefore, the design of potential LAIV based on known properties of viral proteins appears to be a highly appropriate option for the treatment of influenza viral infections. For that, the viral RNA synthesis machinery has been a research focus to identify key amino acid substitutions that can lead to viral attenuation and their use in safe, immunogenic, and protective LAIV.

For the prediction research, a Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network was built from the extraction of useful information about protein interactions connected with aconitine cardiotoxicity, based on nearly a decade of literature and the STRING database. The software Cytoscape and the PharmMapper server were utilized to screen for essential proteins in the constructed network. The Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II alpha (CAMK2A) and gamma (CAMK2G) were identified as potential targets. To obtain a deeper insight on the relationship between the toxicity and the structure of aconitine alkaloids, the present study utilized QSAR models built in Sybyl software that possess internal robustness and external high predictions.

Hemoglobin provides the most abundant source of iron in the human body and is required by several pathogens to cause invasive disease. However, the consequences of hemoglobin evolution for bacterial nutrient acquisition remain unclear. Here we show that the \u03B1- and \u03B2-globin genes exhibit strikingly parallel signatures of adaptive evolution across simian primates. Rapidly evolving sites in hemoglobin correspond to binding interfaces of IsdB, a bacterial hemoglobin receptor harbored by pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. Using an evolution-guided experimental approach, we demonstrate that the divergence between primates and staphylococcal isolates governs hemoglobin recognition and bacterial growth. The reintroduction of putative adaptive mutations in \u03B1- or \u03B2-globin proteins was sufficient to impair S. aureus binding, providing a mechanism for the evolution of disease resistance. These findings suggest that bacterial hemoprotein capture has driven repeated evolutionary conflicts with hemoglobin during primate descent.","publish_time":"2018-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choby, Jacob E.; Buechi, Hanna B.; Farrand, Allison J.; Skaar, Eric P.; Barber, Matthew F.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8125e22d2dc5ad5fe51394fc08dc89212c833d2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6247092.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6247092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial hemoglobin receptor","consequences of hemoglobin evolution","hemoglobin recognition","bacterial growth","evolution of disease resistance","bacterial hemoprotein capture","bacterial nutrient acquisition","parallel signatures of adaptive evolution","aureus binding","\u03B2-globin proteins","\u03B2-globin genes","pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus","simian primates","pathogenic bacteria","host proteins","invasive disease","binding interfaces of IsdB","reintroduction of putative adaptive mutations","repeated evolutionary conflicts","staphylococcal isolates","mechanism","primate descent","abundant source of iron","human body","limiting resource","divergence","evolving sites","pathogens","Metals","findings","experimental approach"],"language":"en"},

We have previously shown that EBOV VP40 in exosomes causes recipient immune cell death. METHODS: Using VP40-producing clones, we analyzed donor cell cycle, extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis, and recipient immune cell death. Transcription of cyclin D1 and nuclear localization of VP40 were examined via kinase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Extracellular vesicle contents were characterized by mass spectrometry, cytokine array, and western blot. Biosafety level-4 facilities were used for wild-type Ebola virus infection studies. RESULTS: VP40 EVs induced apoptosis in recipient T cells and monocytes. VP40 clones were accelerated in growth due to cyclin D1 upregulation, and nuclear VP40 was found bound to the cyclin D1 promoter. Accelerated cell cycling was related to EV biogenesis, resulting in fewer but larger EVs. VP40 EV contents were enriched in ribonucleic acid-binding proteins and cytokines (interleukin-15, transforming growth factor-\u03B21, and interferon-\u03B3). Finally, EBOV-infected cell and animal EVs contained VP40, nucleoprotein, and glycoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear VP40 upregulates cyclin D1 levels, resulting in dysregulated cell cycle and EV biogenesis. Packaging of cytokines and EBOV proteins into EVs from infected cells may be responsible for the decimation of immune cells during EBOV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2018-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pleet, Michelle L; Erickson, James; DeMarino, Catherine; Barclay, Robert A; Cowen, Maria; Lepene, Benjamin; Liang, Janie; Kuhn, Jens H; Prugar, Laura; Stonier, Spencer W; Dye, John M; Zhou, Weidong; Liotta, Lance A; Aman, M Javad; Kashanchi, Fatah","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44d183ae20a5b4fa9ffa65f25f28134c4ac190d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6249571.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/218/suppl_5/S365/26689993/jiy472.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBOV VP40","nuclear VP40","VP40 clones","VP40 EV contents","EBOV-infected cell","nuclear localization of VP40","VP40 EVs induced apoptosis","recipient immune cell death","infected cells","EV biogenesis","EBOV proteins","recipient T cells","decimation of immune cells","dysregulated cell cycle","myeloid cells","donor cell cycle","cyclin D1 levels","cyclin D1 upregulation","Transcription of cyclin D1","EBOV pathogenesis","cyclin D1 promoter","Accelerated cell cycling","extensive death of T cells","animal EVs","larger EVs","Extracellular vesicle contents","Packaging of cytokines","wild-type Ebola virus infection studies","growth factor-\u03B21","ribonucleic acid-binding proteins","mass spectrometry","exosomes","cytokine array","kinase","interleukin","facilities","nucleoprotein","RESULTS","monocytes","fewer","CONCLUSIONS","western blot","chromatin immunoprecipitation assays","interferon-\u03B3","BACKGROUND","lethal infections","Biosafety level","glycoprotein","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide an attractive method to overcome many of these hurdles to rapidly produce therapeutics for emerging diseases. METHODS: In this study, we deployed a platform to generate, test, and develop fully human antibodies to Zaire ebolavirus. We obtained specific anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) antibodies by immunizing VelocImmune mice that use human immunoglobulin variable regions in their humoral responses. RESULTS: Of the antibody clones isolated, 3 were selected as best at neutralizing EBOV and triggering Fc\u03B3RIIIa. Binding studies and negative-stain electron microscopy revealed that the 3 selected antibodies bind to non-overlapping epitopes, including a potentially new protective epitope not targeted by other antibody-based treatments. When combined, a single dose of a cocktail of the 3 antibodies protected nonhuman primates (NHPs) from EBOV disease even after disease symptoms were apparent. CONCLUSIONS: This antibody cocktail provides complementary mechanisms of actions, incorporates novel specificities, and demonstrates high-level postexposure protection from lethal EBOV disease in NHPs. It is now undergoing testing in normal healthy volunteers in preparation for potential use in future Ebola epidemics.","publish_time":"2018-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pascal, Kristen E; Dudgeon, Drew; Trefry, John C; Anantpadma, Manu; Sakurai, Yasuteru; Murin, Charles D; Turner, Hannah L; Fairhurst, Jeanette; Torres, Marcela; Rafique, Ashique; Yan, Ying; Badithe, Ashok; Yu, Kevin; Potocky, Terra; Bixler, Sandra L; Chance, Taylor B; Pratt, William D; Rossi, Franco D; Shamblin, Joshua D; Wollen, Suzanne E; Zelko, Justine M; Carrion, Ricardo; Worwa, Gabriella; Staples, Hilary M; Burakov, Darya; Babb, Robert; Chen, Gang; Martin, Joel; Huang, Tammy T; Erlandson, Karl; Willis, Melissa S; Armstrong, Kimberly; Dreier, Thomas M; Ward, Andrew B; Davey, Robert A; Pitt, Margaret L M; Lipsich, Leah; Mason, Peter; Olson, William; Stahl, Neil; Kyratsous, Christos A","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc66ab3c756846482cc8d1d6abd41b623027fbf1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6249601.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6249601/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":["Zaire"],"keyphrases":["human antibodies","selected antibodies","human monoclonal antibodies","lethal EBOV disease","neutralizing EBOV","antibody cocktail","disease symptoms","NHPs","antibody clones","antibody-based treatments","human immunoglobulin variable regions","potential use","emerging infections","emerging diseases","rapid development of therapeutics","future Ebola epidemics","specific anti-Ebola virus","preparation","immunizing VelocImmune mice","high-level postexposure protection","novel specificities","complementary mechanisms of actions","normal healthy volunteers","negative-stain electron microscopy","safety","non-overlapping epitopes","mAbs","nonhuman primates","desired efficacy","Binding studies","classes of drugs","humoral responses","compounds","testing","new protective epitope","pharmacokinetic profiles","timelines","attractive method","triggering Fc\u03B3RIIIa","hurdles","CONCLUSIONS","Zaire ebolavirus","study","platform","BACKGROUND","single dose","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Patients do not only experience skeletal muscle degeneration, but also develop severe cardiomyopathy by their second decade, one of the main causes of death. The absence of dystrophin in the heart renders cardiomyocytes more sensitive to stretch-induced damage. Moreover, it pathologically alters intracellular calcium (Ca(2\u002B)) concentration, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) localization and mitochondrial function and leads to inflammation and necrosis, all contributing to the development of cardiomyopathy. Current therapies only treat symptoms and therefore the need for targeting the genetic defect is immense. Several preclinical therapies are undergoing development, including utrophin up-regulation, stop codon read-through therapy, viral gene therapy, cell-based therapy and exon skipping. Some of these therapies are undergoing clinical trials, but these have predominantly focused on skeletal muscle correction. However, improving skeletal muscle function without addressing cardiac aspects of the disease may aggravate cardiomyopathy and therefore it is essential that preclinical and clinical focus include improving heart function. This review consolidates what is known regarding molecular pathology of the DMD heart, specifically focusing on intracellular Ca(2\u002B), nNOS and mitochondrial dysregulation. It briefly discusses the current treatment options and then elaborates on the preclinical therapeutic approaches currently under development to restore dystrophin thereby improving pathology, with a focus on the heart.","publish_time":"2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Westering, Tirsa L.

Hand disinfection is frequently recommended for prevention of rhinovirus (RV) infection and RV-associated common colds. The effectiveness of this intervention has not been established in a natural setting. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of hand disinfection on RV infection and RV-associated common cold illness in a natural setting. Methods. A controlled clinical trial was done in young adult volunteers during 9 weeks of the fall 2009 RV season. Volunteers were randomized to either an antiviral hand treatment containing 2% citric acid and 2% malic acid in 62% ethanol (n = 116) or to a no-treatment control group (n = 96). The hand treatment was applied every 3 hours while the subjects were awake. All volunteers kept a daily diary of symptoms and had a nasal lavage for polymerase chain reaction once each week and 2 additional lavages around the time of each common cold illness. The primary endpoint was the number of RV-associated illnesses. The incidence of RV infection and of common cold illnesses were evaluated as secondary endpoints. Results. The hand treatment did not significantly reduce RV infection or RV-related common cold illnesses.

In its simplest form R(0) can be understood as the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vector-transmitted diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high significance on the vector\u2019s life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the R(0) for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R(0) estimates. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used a stochastic, individual-based model which allowed us to directly measure the number of secondary infections arising from one index case under different assumptions about vector mortality. Our results confirm that formulas based on age-independent mortality rates can overestimate R(0) by nearly 100% compared to our own estimate derived from first principles. We further provide a correction factor that can be used with a standard R(0) formula and adjusts for the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. CONCLUSION: Vector mortality rates play a crucial role for the success and general epidemiology of vector-transmitted diseases. Many modelling efforts intrinsically assume these to be age-independent, which, as clearly demonstrated here, can lead to severe over-estimation of the disease\u2019s reproduction number. Our results thus re-emphasise the importance of obtaining field-relevant and species-dependent vector mortality rates, which in turn would facilitate more realistic intervention impact predictions.","publish_time":"2018-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tennant, Warren; Recker, Mario","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b21437159e00cfbc7a48cfb1cc4c27a818e2157.json; document_parses/pdf_json/db459b8a4b49c8b1ad883d0824c6bffccefb525e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6312349.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6312349/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of vector","vector stages","constant vector mortality rates","species-dependent vector mortality rates","general epidemiology of vector","erroneous vector age distributions","age-independent mortality rates","standard R","unrealistic high vector life expectancies","number of infectious contacts","infectious disease","simplest form R","infectious period","disease\u2019s reproduction number","basic reproduction number","transmitted diseases","modelling efforts","number of secondary infections","results","vector\u2019s life expectancy","high significance","index case","predicted success","intervention strategy","required efforts","different assumptions","compartmental modelling frameworks","individual-based model","realistic intervention impact predictions","important repercussions","crucial role","feasibility","turn","field-relevant","discrepancies","severe over-estimation","models","formulas","contact transmission probability","importance","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","METHODOLOGY","Current methods","estimates","principles","correction factor","vectors"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to determine the association between G6PD deficiency and severity of dengue infection in paediatric patients in Myanmar. A cross-sectional study was conducted among paediatric patients aged 2\u201313 years with dengue in Yankin Children Hospital, Myanmar. One hundred and ninety-six patients positive for dengue infection, as determined via PCR or ELISA, were enrolled. Dengue severity was determined according to the 2009 WHO classification guidelines. Spectrophotometric assays determined G6PD levels. The adjusted median G6PD value of males in the study population was used to define various cut-off points according to the WHO classification guidelines. G6PD genotyping for Mahidol, Kaiping and Mediterranean mutations was performed for 128 out of 196 samples by real-time multiplex PCR. 51 of 196 (26.0%) patients had severe dengue. The prevalence of G6PD phenotype deficiency (\u003C 60% activity) in paediatric patients was 14.8% (29/196), specifically, 13.6% (14/103) in males and 16.2% (15/93) in females. Severe deficiency (\u003C 10% activity) accounted for 7.1% (14/196) of our cohort, occurring 11.7% (12/103) in males and 2.2% (2/93) in females. Among 128 samples genotyped, the G6PD gene mutations were detected in 19.5% (25/128) of patients, with 20.3% (13/ 64) in males and 18.8% (12/64) in females. The G6PD Mahidol mutation was 96.0% (24/25) while the G6PD Kaiping mutation was 4.0% (1/25). Severe dengue was not associated with G6PD enzyme deficiency or presence of the G6PD gene mutation.

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to analyze the possible mechanism of SOX2 in the progression of BCC. The levels of SOX2 in BCC cells were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Transwell assays were also used to determine the migration and invasion of BCC cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were used for analyzing the role of SOX2 knockdown in the serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1)-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway in BCC cells. The results demonstrated that SOX2 is overexpressed in BCC tissues and cells. In addition, SOX2 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of BCC cells, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progress of BCC cells. It was also observed that SOX2 knockdown decreased SRPK1 expression, which further led to the downregulation of PI3K and AKT expression levels in BCC cells. Furthermore, SRPK1 transfection or PI3K/AKT pathway activation abolished the inhibitory effects of SOX2 knockdown on the migration, invasion and EMT progress of BCC cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that SOX2 may potentially serve as a target for BCC therapy by targeting the SRPK1-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","publish_time":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zhuo-Ran; Jiang, Yong; Hu, Jian-Zhong; Chen, Yang; Liu, Quan-Zhong","journal":"Oncol Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6da8802866acb6cd35ee1c4a0ec6c64d06b8345.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6341784.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6341784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCC","Transwell","PI3K/AKT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["invasion of BCC cells","progression of BCC","BCC therapy","BCC tissues","levels of SOX2","EMT progress of BCC cells","role of SOX2 knockdown","SOX2 knockdown decreased SRPK1 expression","inhibitory effects of SOX2 knockdown","possible mechanism of SOX2","SRPK1-mediated PI3K","AKT pathway activation","AKT expression levels","migration","downregulation of PI3K","SRPK1 transfection","protein kinase B","results","serine-arginine protein kinase","mediated phosphoinositide","aberrant activation of Hedgehog","reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction","sex","region Y-box","epithelial-mesenchymal transition","common type of human skin cancer","current study","Previous evidence","Basal cell carcinoma","target","addition","aim","conclusion","tumor metastasis","Transwell assays","immunofluorescence"],"language":"en"},

Although the participants from HICs were more likely than those from MICs and LICs to have medical insurance, they were also more likely to have health problems. Furthermore, 43.0, 45.0 and 12.0% of the participants thought that the health services in China were good, fair and poor, respectively. Among the participants, those from HICs were less likely to have positive feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to report a quantitative survey of the health status, health insurance coverage, and health service perceptions of a diverse and surging population of international migrants in China. The findings call for more in-depth studies on the challenges presented by the increasing global migration to the health system.","publish_time":"2019-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maimaitijiang, Remina; He, Qiangsheng; Wu, Yanan; Bouey, Jennifer Z.

This study aimed to establish the reference values for selected hematology and serum clinical chemistry analyses that may contribute to research on shrew in future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples (n=51) were collected from shrews between July and December 2015, Bangladesh, to estimate the levels of hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), total leukocyte count (TLC), total erythrocyte count (TEC), lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, calcium, phosphorus (P), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), urea, glucose, total protein (TP), creatinine, and alanine transaminase (ALT). RESULTS: Although the values did not differ significantly among sexes, age was found to be a significant factor. Hb, PCV, TEC, glucose, and P were higher in males; eosinophil, Na, Cl, TP, and ALT were higher among females. Adults had significantly greater urea and glucose (p\u003C0.05) while juveniles had insignificantly higher values for TLC, PCV, neutrophil, P, and TP.

We studied pertussis in hospitalized infants as related to gestational age (GA) and vaccination history. METHODS: Medical record data of 0-2y old patients hospitalized for pertussis during 2005\u20132014 were linked to vaccination data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between GA and vaccination history on the clinical disease course. We compared vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization for pertussis between term and preterm infants (i.e., \u003C37w GA) using the screening method as developed by Farrington. RESULTS: Of 1187 records, medical data from 676 were retrieved. Of these, 12% concerned preterms, whereas they are 8% of Dutch birth cohorts. Median age at admission was 3 m for preterms and 2 m for terms (p \u003C 0.001). Preterms more often had received pertussis vaccination (62% vs 44%; p = 0.01) and more often had coinfections (37% vs 21%; p = 0.01). Preterms tended more often to have complications, to require artificial respiration or to need admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). Preterms had longer ICU stays (15d vs 9d; p = 0.004). Vaccinated preterms and terms had a lower median length of hospital stay and lower crude risks of apneas and the need for artificial respiration, additional oxygen, and ICU admittance than those not vaccinated. After adjustment for presence of coinfections and age at admittance, these differences were not significant, except the lower need of oxygen treatment in vaccinated terms. Effectiveness of the first vaccination against pertussis hospitalizations was 95% (95% CI 93\u201396%) and 73% (95% CI 20\u201391%) in terms and preterms, respectively. Effectiveness of the second dose of the primary vaccination series was comparable in both groups (86 and 99%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Infants hospitalized for pertussis suffer from severe disease. Preterms were overrepresented, with higher need for intensive treatment and less VE of first vaccination. These findings stress the need for alternative prevention, in particular prenatal vaccination of mothers, to reduce pertussis in both groups.","publish_time":"2019-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Maas, Nicoline A.

It is a biosafety level-4 pathogen, which is transmitted by specific types of fruit bats, mainly Pteropus spp. which are natural reservoir host. The disease was reported for the first time from the Kampung Sungai Nipah village of Malaysia in 1998. Human-to-human transmission also occurs. Outbreaks have been reported also from other countries in South and Southeast Asia. Phylogenetic analysis affirmed the circulation of two major clades of NiV as based on currently available complete N and G gene sequences. NiV isolates from Malaysia and Cambodia clustered together in NiV-MY clade, whereas isolates from Bangladesh and India clusterered within NiV-BD clade. NiV isolates from Thailand harboured mixed population of sequences. In humans, the virus is responsible for causing rapidly progressing severe illness which might be characterized by severe respiratory illness and/or deadly encephalitis. In pigs below six months of age, respiratory illness along with nervous symptoms may develop. Different types of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays along with molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction have been developed for diagnostic purposes. Due to the expensive nature of the antibody drugs, identification of broad-spectrum antivirals is essential along with focusing on small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). High pathogenicity of NiV in humans, and lack of vaccines or therapeutics to counter this disease have attracted attention of researchers worldwide for developing effective NiV vaccine and treatment regimens.","publish_time":"2019-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Raj Kumar; Dhama, Kuldeep; Chakraborty, Sandip; Tiwari, Ruchi; Natesan, Senthilkumar; Khandia, Rekha; Munjal, Ashok; Vora, Kranti Suresh; Latheef, Shyma K.; Karthik, Kumaragurubaran; Singh Malik, Yashpal; Singh, Rajendra; Chaicumpa, Wanpen; Mourya, Devendra T.","journal":"Vet Q","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da00316edfd01f02f8628c4e5740e0b825137634.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6830995.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6830995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kampung Sungai Nipah"],"locations":["South","Southeast Asia","Malaysia","Cambodia","Bangladesh","India","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["NiV isolates","NiV-BD clade","effective NiV vaccine","major clades of NiV","High pathogenicity of NiV","Nipah virus","severe illness","severe respiratory illness","viral disease","humans","Kampung Sungai Nipah village of Malaysia","human transmission","Different types of enzyme","G gene sequences","mixed population of sequences","specific types of fruit bats","molecular methods","linked immunosorbent assays","antibody drugs","Pteropus","zoonotic infection","available complete N","identification of broad-spectrum antivirals","polymerase chain reaction","circulation","time","India","Thailand","months of age","genus Henipavirus","treatment regimens","attention of researchers","lack of vaccines","paramyxovirus","Bangladesh","small interfering RNAs","Cambodia","expensive nature","nervous symptoms","deadly encephalitis","countries","Southeast Asia","family Paramyxoviridae","siRNAs","natural reservoir host","therapeutics","Phylogenetic analysis","diagnostic purposes","biosafety level","pigs","Outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

TSB and/or TSF promoted phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-coA carboxylase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha upregulation. Furthermore, TSB and TSF suppressed FFA-induced liver X receptor, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription protein 1, fatty acid synthase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 protein expression. Moreover, TSB and/or TSF induced phosphorylation of Unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 expressions. Therefore, TSB and TSF relieve lipid accumulation by attenuating lipogenic protein expression, activating the AMPK pathway, and upregulating the autophagic flux to enhance lipid metabolism.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) together for boredom classification, although these data have potential features for emotion classification. To investigate the combined effect of these features on boredom classification, we collected EEG and GSR data from 28 participants using off-the-shelf sensors. During data acquisition, we used a set of stimuli comprising a video clip designed to elicit boredom and two other video clips of entertaining content. The collected samples were labeled based on the participants\u2019 questionnaire-based testimonies on experienced boredom levels. Using the collected data, we initially trained 30 models with 19 machine learning algorithms and selected the top three candidate classifiers. After tuning the hyperparameters, we validated the final models through 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross validation to increase the robustness of the test results. Our results indicated that a Multilayer Perceptron model performed the best with a mean accuracy of 79.98% (AUC: 0.781). It also revealed the correlation between boredom and the combined features of EEG and GSR. These results can be useful for building accurate affective computing systems and understanding the physiological properties of boredom.","publish_time":"2019-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seo, Jungryul; Laine, Teemu H.; Sohn, Kyung-Ah","journal":"Sensors (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88511032b2c7ac3a42adf31909cb0c281c079922.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6832442.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6832442/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GSR","Multilayer Perceptron","EEG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["boredom classification","GSR data","collected data","physiological data","physiological properties of boredom","experienced boredom levels","data acquisition","combined features of EEG","emotion classification","potential features","best","test results","collected samples","accurate affective computing systems","combined effect","final models","previous studies","user\u2019s emotions","Numerous studies","myriad of target emotions","higher level of emotion","participants\u2019 questionnaire-based testimonies","video clips of entertaining content","electroencephalography","galvanic skin response","Multilayer Perceptron model","iterations","robustness","set of stimuli","various facets of daily life","mean accuracy","off-the-shelf sensors","machine learning algorithms","cross validation","awareness","knowledge","recent years","correlation","medical issues","AUC","hyperparameters","candidate classifiers"],"language":"en"},

Despite control efforts involving improved biosecurity and different vaccination protocols, the virus continues to circulate and evolve. One of the foremost challenges in its control is high levels of genetic and antigenic diversity. Here, we quantify the co-circulation, emergence and sequential turnover of multiple PRRSV lineages in a single swine-producing region in the United States over a span of 9 years (2009\u20132017). By classifying over 4,000 PRRSV sequences (open-reading frame 5) into phylogenetic lineages and sub-lineages, we document the ongoing diversification and temporal dynamics of the PRRSV population, including the rapid emergence of a novel sub-lineage that appeared to be absent globally pre-2008. In addition, lineage 9 was the most prevalent lineage from 2009 to 2010, but its occurrence fell to 0.5% of all sequences identified per year after 2014, coinciding with the emergence or re-emergence of lineage 1 as the dominant lineage. The sequential dominance of different lineages, as well as three different sub-lineages within lineage 1, is consistent with the immune-mediated selection hypothesis for the sequential turnover in the dominant lineage. As host populations build immunity through natural infection or vaccination toward the most common variant, this dominant (sub-) lineage may be replaced by an emerging variant to which the population is more susceptible. An analysis of patterns of non- synonymous and synonymous mutations revealed evidence of positive selection on immunologically important regions of the genome, further supporting the potential that immune-mediated selection shapes the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics for this virus. This has important implications for patterns of emergence and re-emergence of genetic variants of PRRSV that have negative impacts on the swine industry. Constant surveillance on PRRSV occurrence is crucial to a better understanding of the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of co-circulating viral lineages. Further studies utilizing whole genome sequencing and exploring the extent of cross-immunity between heterologous PRRS viruses could shed further light on PRRSV immunological response and aid in developing strategies that might be able to diminish disease impact.","publish_time":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paploski, Igor Adolfo Dexheimer; Corzo, Cesar; Rovira, Albert; Murtaugh, Michael P.; Sanhueza, Juan Manuel; Vilalta, Carles; Schroeder, Declan C.; VanderWaal, Kimberly","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fb6893b7abf4b147f4185c6f94a06c79773d3ec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6839445.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6839445/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRS"],"locations":["U.S.","United States"],"keyphrases":["dominant lineage","re-emergence of lineage","PRRSV population","PRRSV occurrence","PRRSV sequences","prevalent lineage","different sub-lineages","novel sub-lineage","sequential turnover of multiple PRRSV lineages","phylogenetic lineages","sequential dominance of different lineages","PRRSV immunological response","re-emergence of genetic variants of PRRSV","patterns of emergence","epidemiological dynamics","evolutionary dynamics of co-circulating viral lineages","rapid emergence","swine industry","immune-mediated selection shapes","immune-mediated selection hypothesis","temporal dynamics","immunity","different vaccination protocols","single swine","important regions","important implications","evidence of positive selection","Respiratory Syndrome Virus","important endemic pathogen","synonymous mutations","control efforts","co-circulation","analysis of patterns","common variant","genome sequencing","emerging variant","high levels of genetic","light","aid","improved biosecurity","better understanding","heterologous PRRS viruses","developing strategies","extent of cross","natural infection","negative impacts","potential","frame","ongoing diversification","United States","host populations","antigenic diversity","Constant surveillance","foremost challenges","span","disease impact","years","studies","addition"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to identify and to produce epidemiologic knowledge about the etiologic agent associated with a death of two female Psittacus erithacus (grey parrot). Methods and Results: Both parrots were submitted for a complete standardised necropsy. Tissue samples were analysed by PCR. The findings in necropsy were compatible with bornavirus infection. Analysis revealed PaBV-4 related with genotypes detected in captive and in wild birds. The N and X proteins of PaBV-4 were more related to avian bornaviruses, while phosphoprotein was more related to variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 (VSBV-1). Within the P gene/phosphoprotein a highly conserved region between and within bornavirus species was found. Conclusions: Portugal is on the routes of the intensive world trade of psittacines. Broad screening studies are required to help understanding the role of wild birds in the emergence and spread of pathogenic bornaviruses. PaBV-4 phosphoprotein is closer to VSBV-1 associated with lethal encephalitis in humans than with some of the avian bornaviruses.

This dichotomy is exemplified by cathepsin L (CTSL), which helps Hendra virus and SARS coronavirus to invade cells, but is essential for survival in mice with mycoplasma pneumonia. The present study tested the hypothesis that CTSL protects mice from serious consequences of infection by the orthomyxovirus influenza A, which is thought to be activated by host-supplied proteases other than CTSL. Ctsl(-/-) mice infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) had larger lung viral loads and higher mortality than infected Ctsl(\u002B/\u002B) mice. Lung inflammation in surviving infected mice peaked 14 days after initial infection, accompanied marked focal distal airway bronchiolization and epithelial metaplasia followed by desquamation and fibrotic interstitial remodeling, and persisted for at least 6 weeks. Most deaths occurred during the second week of infection in both groups of mice. In contrast to mycoplasma pneumonia, infiltrating cells were predominantly mononuclear rather than polymorphonuclear. The histopathology of lung inflammation and remodeling in survivors was similar in Ctsl(-/-) and Ctsl(\u002B/\u002B) mice, although Ctsl(\u002B/\u002B) mice cleared immunoreactive virus sooner. Furthermore, Ctsl(-/-) mice had profound deficits in CD4\u002B lymphocytes before and after infection and weaker production of pathogen-specific IgG. Thus, CTSL appears to support innate as well as adaptive responses, which confer a survival advantage on mice infected with the orthomyxovirus influenza A.","publish_time":"2016-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Xiang; Greenland, John R.; Gotts, Jeffrey E.; Matthay, Michael A.; Caughey, George H.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f695bec496fb166d09c3377627d86cc587c2f27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5055332.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27716790/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","CTSL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected mice","infected Ctsl","groups of mice","initial infection","week of infection","orthomyxovirus influenza","serious consequences of infection","histopathology of lung inflammation","mycoplasma pneumonia","host-supplied proteases","Host-derived proteases","larger lung viral loads","infiltrating cells","survival advantage","Hendra virus","immunoreactive virus","fibrotic interstitial remodeling","epithelial metaplasia","marked focal distal airway bronchiolization","higher mortality","desquamation","H1N1","weaker production of pathogen","lymphocytes","CD4","hypothesis","survivors","days","specific IgG","SARS coronavirus","profound deficits","contrast","adaptive responses","Puerto Rico","present study","polymorphonuclear","cathepsin","clear infections","dichotomy","deaths","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Six topics were addressed in detail by speakers and workshop participants and are reported in a series of six reports. This workshop report, the second in the series, provides recommendations for current and future use of non-animal methods and strategies for veterinary vaccine potency testing. Workshop participants recommended that future efforts to replace animal use give priority to vaccines (1) that use large numbers of animals per test and for which many serials are produced annually, (2) that involve significant animal pain and distress during procedures, (3) for which the functional protective antigen has been identified, (4) that involve foreign animal/zoonotic organisms that are dangerous to humans, and (5) that involve pathogens that can be easily spread to wildlife populations. Vaccines identified as the highest priorities were those for rabies, Leptospira spp., Clostridium spp., Erysipelas, foreign animal diseases (FAD), poultry diseases, and fish diseases. Further research on the identification, purification, and characterization of vaccine protective antigens in veterinary vaccines was also identified as a priority. Workshop participants recommended priority research, development, and validation activities to address critical knowledge and data gaps, including opportunities to apply new science and technology. Recommendations included (1) investigations into the relative impact of various adjuvants on antigen quantification assays, (2) investigations into extraction methods that could be used for vaccines containing adjuvants that can interfere with antigen assays, and (3) review of the current status of rabies and tetanus human vaccine in vitro potency methods for their potential application to the corresponding veterinary vaccines. Workshop participants recommended enhanced international harmonization and cooperation and closer collaborations between human and veterinary researchers to expedite progress. Implementation of the workshop recommendations is expected to advance alternative in vitro methods for veterinary vaccine potency testing that will benefit animal welfare and replace animal use while ensuring continued protection of human and animal health.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kulpa-Eddy, Jodie; Srinivas, Geetha; Halder, Marlies; Hill, Richard; Brown, Karen; Roth, James; Draayer, Hans; Galvin, Jeffrey; Claassen, Ivo; Gifford, Glen; Woodland, Ralph; Doelling, Vivian; Jones, Brett; Stokes, William S","journal":"Procedia in Vaccinology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eeed3ffbb9e4731570065f7634b6b7927a729862.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877282X11000233; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.provac.2011.10.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877282X11000233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288914/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICCVAM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal use","workshop participants","potency methods","animal welfare","animal health","workshop recommendations","foreign animal diseases","future use of non-animal methods","veterinary vaccine potency testing","international workshop","corresponding veterinary vaccines","workshop report","significant animal pain","veterinary researchers","improved methods","extraction methods","tetanus human vaccine","safety testing methods","science of human","antigen assays","priority research","characterization of vaccine protective antigens","opportunities","continued protection of human","poultry diseases","fish diseases","investigations","antigen quantification assays","new science","functional protective antigen","series","review","current status of rabies","future efforts","enhanced international harmonization","relative impact of various adjuvants","strategies","closer collaborations","cooperation","potential application","validation activities","Erysipelas","FAD","development","critical knowledge","data gaps","zoonotic organisms","purification","Clostridium","Leptospira","distress","procedures","ICCVAM","state","Abstract NICEATM","highest priorities","large numbers of animals","humans","identification","technology","progress","speakers","Implementation","wildlife populations","serials","topics","reports","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Regarding longer time periods, influenza epidemics occasionally occur very early in the season, as during the 2009 pandemic. Whether early occurrence of influenza epidemics impacts outbreaks of other common seasonal viruses is not clear. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether early occurrence of influenza outbreaks coincides with shifts in the occurrence of other common viruses, including both respiratory and non\u2010respiratory viruses. METHODS: We investigated time trends of and the correlation between positive laboratory diagnoses of eight common viruses in the Netherlands over a 10\u2010year time period (2003\u20132012): influenza viruses types A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, coronavirus, norovirus, enterovirus, and rotavirus. We compared trends in viruses between early and late influenza seasons. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2012, influenza B, RSV, and coronavirus showed shifts in their occurrence when influenza A epidemics occurred earlier than usual (before week 1). Although shifts were not always consistently of the same type, when influenza type A hit early, RSV outbreaks tended to be delayed, coronavirus outbreaks tended to be intensified, and influenza virus type B tended not to occur at all. Occurrence of rhinovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, and enterovirus did not change. CONCLUSION: When influenza A epidemics occured early, timing of the epidemics of several respiratory winter viruses usually occurring close in time to influenza A was affected, while trends in rhinoviruses (occurring in autumn) and trends in enteral viruses were not.","publish_time":"2015-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Asten, Liselotte; Bijkerk, Paul; Fanoy, Ewout; van Ginkel, Annemarijn; Suijkerbuijk, Anita; van der Hoek, Wim; Meijer, Adam; Vennema, Harry","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60cfb43ca9b8d54f5b8cb4ab264d8d628c7c227b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4687500.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26369646/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["outbreaks of influenza","influenza B","influenza viruses types","early occurrence of influenza outbreaks","common viruses","common respiratory viruses","early occurrence of influenza epidemics impacts outbreaks","respiratory winter viruses","non\u2010respiratory viruses","enteral viruses","influenza virus type B","common seasonal viruses","late influenza seasons","RSV outbreaks","coronavirus outbreaks","time trends","Occurrence of rhinovirus","shifts","respiratory syncytial virus","norovirus","longer time periods","year time period","enterovirus","rotavirus","positive laboratory diagnoses","correlation","autumn","Viral interaction","Netherlands","hit","timing","BACKGROUND","rhinoviruses","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSION","short studies","pandemic","week","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Discovery of new and effective drugs for the treatment of influenza is a crucial issue for the global medical community. According to our previous study, TSL-1, a fraction of the aqueous extract from the tender leaf of Toonasinensis, has demonstrated antiviral activities against pandemic influenza A (H1N1) through the down-regulation of adhesion molecules and chemokine to prevent viral attachment. Methods The aim of the present study was to identify the active compounds in TSL-1 which exert anti-influenza A (H1N1) virus effects. XTT assay was used to detect the cell viability. Meanwhile, the inhibitory effect on the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus was analyzed by observing plaque formation, qRT-PCR, neuraminidase activity, and immunofluorescence staining of influenza A-specific glycoprotein. Results Both catechin and gallic acid were found to be potent inhibitors in terms of influenza virus mRNA replication and MDCK plaque formation. Additionally, both compounds inhibited neuraminidase activities and viral glycoprotein. The 50% effective inhibition concentration (EC50) of catechin and gallic acid for the influenza A (H1N1) virus were 18.4 \u03BCg/mL and 2.6 \u03BCg/mL, respectively; whereas the 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) of catechin and gallic acid were \u003E100 \u03BCg/mL and 22.1 \u03BCg/mL, respectively. Thus, the selectivity indexes (SI) of catechin and gallic acid were \u003E5.6 and 22.1, respectively. Conclusion The present study demonstrates that catechin might be a safe reagent for long-term use to prevent influenza A (H1N1) virus infection; whereas gallic acid might be a sensitive reagent to inhibit influenza virus infection. We conclude that these two phyto-chemicals in TSL-1 are responsible for exerting anti-pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus effects.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"You, Huey-Ling; Huang, Chao-Chun; Chen, Chung-Jen; Chang, Cheng-Chin; Liao, Pei-Lin; Huang, Sheng-Teng","journal":"Journal of the Chinese Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e789bfcde62b68fd1437876ce5e114abb7cfdd58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105043.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1726490117303519; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1726490117303519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29287704/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcma.2017.11.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["XTT","MDCK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus infection","H1N1","anti-influenza","treatment of influenza","anti-pandemic influenza","catechin","virus effects","gallic acid","terms of influenza virus mRNA replication","immunofluorescence staining of influenza","\u03BCg","TSL","present study","neuraminidase activities","viral glycoprotein","previous study","MDCK plaque formation","sensitive reagent","neuraminidase activity","safe reagent","antiviral activities","effective drugs","viral attachment","specific glycoprotein","active compounds","effective inhibition concentration","crucial issue","EC50","potent inhibitors","qRT-PCR","chemokine","CC50","tender leaf of Toonasinensis","aqueous extract","regulation of adhesion molecules","long-term use","global medical community","Discovery of new","Abstract Background","large proportion","human population","fraction","cytotoxic concentrations","selectivity indexes","Methods","aim","Conclusion","inhibitory effect","phyto-chemicals","XTT assay","cell viability"],"language":"en"},

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(4), 559\u2013566. Background Respiratory viruses are known to cocirculate but this has not been described in detail during an influenza pandemic. Objectives To describe respiratory viruses, including co\u2010infection and associated attributes such as age, sex or comorbidity, in patients presenting with influenza\u2010like illness to a community sentinel network, during the pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 in Ontario, Canada. Methods Respiratory samples and epidemiologic details were collected from 1018 patients with influenza\u2010like illness as part of respiratory virus surveillance and a multiprovincial case\u2013control study of influenza vaccine effectiveness. Results At least one virus was detected in 668 (65\u00B76%) of 1018 samples; 512 (50\u00B73%) had single infections and 156 (15\u00B73%) co\u2010infections. Of single infections, the most common viruses were influenza A in 304 (59\u00B74%) samples of which 275 (90\u00B75%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and enterovirus/rhinovirus in 149 (29\u00B71%) samples. The most common co\u2010infections were influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus B, and influenza A and enterovirus/rhinovirus. In multinomial logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, and timeliness of sample collection, single infection was less often detected in the elderly and co\u2010infection more often in patients \u003C30 years of age. Co\u2010infection, but not single infection, was more likely detected in patients who had a sample collected within 2 days of symptom onset as compared to 3\u20137 days. Conclusions Respiratory viral co\u2010infections are commonly detected when using molecular techniques. Early sample collection increases likelihood of detection of co\u2010infection. Further studies are needed to better understand the clinical significance of viral co\u2010infection.","publish_time":"2012-08-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peci, Adriana; Winter, Anne\u2010Luise; Gubbay, Jonathan B.; Skowronski, Danuta M.; Balogun, Elizabeth I.; De Lima, Cedric; Crowcroft, Natasha S.; Rebbapragada, Anu","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/987177dd5896befd3e45e5d1fae03839b41b320b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5781002.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00418.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22883216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ontario Sentinel","Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["influenza pandemic","common co\u2010infections","Conclusions Respiratory viral co\u2010infections","Background Respiratory viruses","single infections","Methods Respiratory samples","clinical significance of viral co\u2010infection","respiratory virus surveillance","common viruses","respiratory syncytial virus B","control study of influenza vaccine effectiveness","patients of Ontario Sentinel practices","sex","timeliness of sample collection","illness","comorbidity","pdm09","years of age","H1N1","enterovirus","rhinovirus","community sentinel network","Early sample collection increases likelihood of detection","days of symptom onset","multiprovincial case","associated attributes","epidemiologic details","multinomial logistic regression analyses","Canada","cocirculate","Peci","Objectives","molecular techniques","paper","Results","studies"],"language":"en"},

SARS is a threat which is similar to MERS virus, but the comorbidity is the key aspect to underline their different impacts. One UK doctor says \u0022I\u2019d rather have HIV than diabetes\u0022 as life expectancy among diabetes patients is lower than that of HIV. However, HIV has a comorbidity impact on the diabetes. RESULTS: We present a quantitative framework to compare and explore comorbidity between diseases. By using neighbourhood based benchmark and topological methods, we have built comorbidity relationships network based on the OMIM and our identified significant genes. Then based on the gene expression, PPI and signalling pathways data, we investigate the comorbidity association of these 2 infective pathologies with other 7 diseases (heart failure, kidney disorder, breast cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, bone diseases, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes). Phenotypic association is measured by calculating both the Relative Risk as the quantified measures of comorbidity tendency of two disease pairs and the \u03D5-correlation to measure the robustness of the comorbidity associations. The differential gene expression profiling strongly suggests that the response of SARS affected patients seems to be mainly an innate inflammatory response and statistically dysregulates a large number of genes, pathways and PPIs subnetworks in different pathologies such as chronic heart failure (21 genes), breast cancer (16 genes) and bone diseases (11 genes). HIV-1 induces comorbidities relationship with many other diseases, particularly strong correlation with the neurological, cancer, metabolic and immunological diseases. Similar comorbidities risk is observed from the clinical information. Moreover, SARS and HIV infections dysregulate 4 genes (ANXA3, GNS, HIST1H1C, RASA3) and 3 genes (HBA1, TFRC, GHITM) respectively that affect the ageing process. It is notable that HIV and SARS similarly dysregulated 11 genes and 3 pathways. Only 4 significantly dysregulated genes are common between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including NFKBIA that is a key regulator of immune responsiveness implicated in susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Our method presents a ripe opportunity to use data-driven approaches for advancing our current knowledge on disease mechanism and predicting disease comorbidities in a quantitative way.

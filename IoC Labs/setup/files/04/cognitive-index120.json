For sustained production of animals products, healthy livestock and poultry farming are the major concerns as animals are susceptible to various infectious agents viz. bacteria, virus, and parasites leading to huge economical losses in the form of livestock\u2019s morbidity and mortality. Besides, zoonotic nature of some infectious pathogens of animals is also raising concern for human safety. Vaccination of animals against various diseases present in different geographical regions is a best known strategy for prevention of different disease outbreaks both in organized and unorganized livestock and poultry sectors. Vaccines had played a major role in eradication of different dreaded diseases of livestock sectors globally. In this article we have discussed different vaccine types, various vaccine strategies used for the development of more efficacious and safe vaccines and commercially available vaccines for livestock and poultry.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nimmanapalli, Ramadevi; Gupta, Vikas","journal":"Genomics and Biotechnological Advances in Veterinary, Poultry, and Fisheries","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33aceb941234a4f2da4bf9412fbb1bccbe98eb78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149732.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128163528000205; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128163528000205","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthy livestock","Vaccination of animals","unorganized livestock","poultry sectors","different vaccine types","eradication of different dreaded diseases of livestock sectors","infectious pathogens of animals","different geographical regions","various diseases present","various vaccine strategies","various infectious agents","sustained production of animals products","poultry farming","available vaccines","safe vaccines","prevention of different disease outbreaks","major role","major concerns","animal products","best known strategy","virus","bacteria","development","huge economical losses","form of livestock\u2019s morbidity","parasites","faster rate day-by-day","demands","zoonotic nature","mortality","article","world population","human safety","food security"],"language":"en"},

Many tumor-associated antigens are excellent targets for immune therapy and vaccine design. Optimally designed cancer vaccines should combine the best tumor antigens with the most effective immunotherapy agents and/or delivery strategies to achieve positive clinical results. Various vaccine delivery systems such as different routes of immunization and physical/chemical delivery methods have been used in cancer therapy with the goal to induce immunity against tumor-associated antigens. Two basic delivery approaches including physical delivery to achieve higher levels of antigen production and formulation with microparticles to target antigen-presenting cells (APCs) have demonstrated to be effective in animal models. New developments in vaccine delivery systems will improve the efficiency of clinical trials in the near future. Among them, nanoparticles (NPs) such as dendrimers, polymeric NPs, metallic NPs, magnetic NPs and quantum dots have emerged as effective vaccine adjuvants for infectious diseases and cancer therapy. Furthermore, cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) have been known as attractive carrier having applications in drug delivery, gene transfer and DNA vaccination. This review will focus on the utilization of different vaccine delivery systems for prevention or treatment of cancer. We will discuss their clinical applications and the future prospects for cancer vaccine development.","publish_time":"2011-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bolhassani, Azam; Safaiyan, Shima; Rafati, Sima","journal":"Mol Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8abd9e10df6beeffec38bc7dd7083318e0d69ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3024302.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21211062/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-4598-10-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["physical delivery","drug delivery","delivery strategies","Various vaccine delivery systems","cancer therapy","cancer vaccine development","utilization of different vaccine delivery systems","vaccine design","treatment of cancer","chemical delivery methods","basic delivery approaches","effective vaccine adjuvants","clinical applications","designed cancer vaccines","tumor-associated antigens","metallic NPs","magnetic NPs","polymeric NPs","clinical oncologist","best tumor antigens","immune therapy","efficiency of clinical trials","positive clinical results","effective immunotherapy agents","future prospects","near future","different routes of immunization","higher levels of antigen production","excellent targets","quantum dots","formulation","gene transfer","dendrimers","infectious diseases","prevention","microparticles","immunity","DNA vaccination","attractive carrier","promising tools","CPP","hands","goal","New developments","cell-penetrating peptides","cells","APCs","animal models"],"language":"en"},

We collected 11,398 respiratory samples from hospitalized pediatric patients with acute respiratory illness between July 2009 and June 2016 in Guangzhou. The samples were tested simultaneously for 18 respiratory pathogens using real-time PCR. Local meteorological data were also collected for correlation analysis. Of 11,398 patients tested, 5606 (49.2%) patients tested positive for one or more pathogens; RSV, PIV, and HMPV were the first, sixth, and ninth most frequently detected pathogens, in 1690 (14.8%), 502 (4.4%), and 321 (2.8%) patients, respectively. A total 17.9% (4605/5606) of patients with positive results had coinfection with other pathogens. Significant differences were found in the prevalence of RSV, PIV, and HMPV among all age groups (p \u003C 0.001). RSV and HMPV had similar seasonal patterns, with two prevalence peaks every year. PIV appeared alternatively with RSV and HMPV. Multiple linear regression models were established for RSV, PIV, and HMPV prevalence and meteorological factors (p \u003C 0.05). RSV and PIV incidence was negatively correlated with monthly mean relative humidity; RSV and HMPV incidence was negatively correlated with sunshine duration; PIV incidence was positively correlated with mean temperature. We described the features of paramyxovirus infection in a subtropical region of China and highlighted the correlation with meteorological factors. These findings will assist public health authorities and clinicians in improving strategies for controlling paramyxovirus infection.","publish_time":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wen-Kuan; Chen, De-Hui; Tan, Wei-Ping; Qiu, Shu-Yan; Xu, Duo; Zhang, Li; Gu, Shu-Jun; Zhou, Rong; Liu, Qian","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/347f19fee8147e17a853627c99decbeada4660dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6858468.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-019-03693-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489496/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPV","RSV","PIV"],"locations":["Guangzhou","China"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of RSV","HMPV incidence","HMPV prevalence","PIV incidence","respiratory pathogens","respiratory samples","meteorological factors","features of paramyxovirus infection","detected pathogens","features of paramyxovirus respiratory syncytial virus","hospitalized pediatric patients","acute respiratory illness","subtropical region of China","effect of meteorological conditions","Local meteorological data","Guangzhou","subtropical region of southern China","parainfluenza virus","mean temperature","positive results","correlation analysis","monthly mean relative humidity","clinicians","strategies","similar seasonal patterns","public health authorities","sunshine duration","human metapneumovirus","Multiple linear regression models","coinfection","age groups","findings","real-time PCR","Significant differences","year"],"language":"en"},

We report the detection of an alphacoronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene sequence in the feces of two of 19 different T. brasiliensis that were capture/release bats that had been evaluated for overall health. The RdRp sequence is similar but not identical to previously detected sequences in the feces of two different species of bats (T. brasiliensis and Molossus molossus) in Brazil. In common with the experience of others doing similar work, attempts to isolate the virus in cell cultures were unsuccessful. We surmise that this and highly related alphacoronavirus are carried by Brazilian free-tailed bats living in a wide eco-spatial region.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. METHODS: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. FINDINGS: The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99\u00B798% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

METHODS: Several household materials were evaluated for the capacity to block bacterial and viral aerosols. Twenty-one healthy volunteers made their own face masks from cotton t-shirts; the masks were then tested for fit. The number of microorganisms isolated from coughs of healthy volunteers wearing their homemade mask, a surgical mask, or no mask was compared using several air-sampling techniques. RESULTS: The median-fit factor of the homemade masks was one-half that of the surgical masks. Both masks significantly reduced the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers, although the surgical mask was 3 times more effective in blocking transmission than the homemade mask. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection.

A search for LAI and zoonoses in the Asia-Pacific region using online search engines revealed a relatively low number of reports. Only 27 LAI reports were published between 1982 and 2016. The most common pathogens associated with LAIs were dengue virus, Arthroderma spp., Brucella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Rickettsia spp., and Shigella spp. Seventy-eight percent (21 out of 27 LAI reports) occurred in high-income countries (i.e., Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) where laboratories were likely to comply with international biosafety standards. Two upper-middle income countries (China (2), and Malaysia (2)) and one lower-middle income country (India (2)) reported LAI incidents. The majority of the reports (fifty-two percent (14/27)) of LAIs occurred in research laboratories. Five LAI reports were from clinical or diagnostic laboratories that are considered at the frontier for zoonotic disease detection. Governments and laboratories in the Asia-Pacific region should be encouraged to report LAI cases as it provides a useful tool to monitor unintended release of zoonotic pathogens and to further improve laboratory biosafety.

Infection with other ALV subgroup (A/B) strains also triggered ERK/MAPK activation. Moreover, when activating ERK2, ALV subgroups A, B and J simultaneously induced the phosphorylation of c-Jun, an AP1 family member and p38 activation but had no obvious effect on JNK activation at either 15 min or 120 h. Interestingly, only PD98059 inhibited the ALV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation while SP600125 or SB203580 had no influence on c-Jun activation. Furthermore, the viral gp85 and gag proteins were found to contribute to ERK2/AP1 activation. Additionally, the specific ERK inhibitor, PD980509, significantly suppressed ALV replication, as evidenced by extremely low levels of ALV promoter activity and ALV-J protein expression.

The identification of many novel proteases from genome\u2010sequencing programs has suggested them as potential new therapeutic targets. In addition, several well\u2010characterized metallopeptidases were recently shown to possess new biological roles in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. As a result of these studies, metabolism of the neurotoxic and inflammatory amyloid peptide (A\u03B2) is considered as a physiologically relevant process with several metallopeptidases being suggested for the role of amyloid\u2010degrading enzymes. These include the neprilysin (NEP) family of metalloproteinases (including its homologue endothelin\u2010converting enzyme), insulin\u2010degrading enzyme, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme, plasmin, and, possibly, some other enzymes. NEP also has a role in metabolism of sensory and inflammatory neuropeptides such as tachykinins and neurokinins. The existence of natural enzymatic mechanisms for removal of amyloid peptides has extended the therapeutic avenues in Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD) and neurodegeneration. The proteolytic events underlying AD are highly compartmentalized in the cell and formation of amyloid peptide from its precursor molecule APP (amyloid precursor protein) takes place both within intracellular compartments and in the plasma membrane, especially in lipid raft domains. Degradation of amyloid peptide by metallopeptidases can also be both intra\u2010 and extracellular depending on the activity of membrane\u2010bound enzymes and their soluble partners. Soluble forms of proteases can be secreted or released from the cell surface through the activity of \u201Csheddases\u201D\u2014another group of proteolytic enzymes involved in key cellular regulatory functions. The activity of proteases involved in amyloid metabolism depends on numerous factors (e.g., genetic, environmental, age), and some conditions (e.g., hypoxia and ischemia) shift the balance of amyloid metabolism toward accumulation of higher concentrations of A\u03B2.

Even in those companies with crisis management teams (CMTs), the members often do not meet to plan or even discuss how the team would function in an actual situation. The most progressive firms offer the team members, fire brigades, and employees an opportunity to preplan (contingency planning) through mock exercises that replicate industrial disasters, explosions, fires, or tornado alerts. The end result is a better-prepared team of employees ready to respond to any contingency. Unfortunately, many firms have not gone this far. Contingency planning may not have been a traditional security process, but in today\u2019s global business environment the security organization is assuming a much greater role and responsibility for its implementation. Even prior to the events of September 11, 2001, many organizations were becoming more conscious of the need to have contingency plans. A complete contingency planning program has three major elements: 1. Emergency Response 2. Crisis Management 3. Business Continuity: Business Recovery and Business Resumption Emergency response activities involve responding to an incident, crisis or disaster and managing that incident at the scene. Should an incident escalate to the crisis or disaster stage, a CMT should take over managing the crisis to its conclusion. If the crisis or disaster does cause damage to a company building, facility or operation, the CMT should hand over to a business continuity team the responsibility of recovery and resumption. After a disaster, it is critical that the business recovers and resumes normal (pre-event) operations as soon as possible. Customers, shareholders and stakeholders expect nothing less. Executive management has the obligation to ensure contingency planning is properly considered and addressed within their company. The consequences of not planning for contingencies can be catastrophic with numerous liability issues.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fischer, Robert J.; Halibozek, Edward P.; Walters, David C.","journal":"Introduction to Security","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e711305435f5ce3508c3cc9b4bba6ef4f0b2d9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149346.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128053102000111; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128053102000111","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Business Recovery and Business Resumption Emergency","CMT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["importance of contingency planning","contingency plans","Business Recovery","business continuity team","complete contingency planning program","business recovers","crisis management teams","team members","incident","Business Resumption Emergency response activities","disaster stage","today\u2019s global business environment","responsibility of recovery","Executive management","progressive firms","company","better-prepared team of employees ready","security organization","traditional security process","explosions","mock exercises","fires","industrial disasters","CMTs","pre-event","greater role","major elements","contingencies","facility","shelf","companies","brigades","recognition","damage","opportunity","obligation","numerous liability issues","end result","tornado alerts","operations","implementation","need","Customers","shareholders","stakeholders","organizations","CEO\u2019s office","actual situation","events","consequences","scene","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

PNA contains neutral backbone hence due to the absence of electrostatic repulsion, its hybridization shows remarkable stability towards complementary oligonucleotides. PNAs are highly resistant to cleavage by chemicals and enzymes due to the substrate specific nature of enzymes and therefore not degraded inside the cells. PNAs are emerging as new tools in the market due to their applications in antisense and antigene therapies by inhibiting translation and transcription respectively. Hence, several methods based on PNAs have been developed for designing various anticancer and antigene drugs, detection of mutations or modulation of PCR reactions. The duplex homopurine sequence of DNA may also be recognized by PNA, forming firm PNA/DNA/PNA triplex through strand invasion with a looped-out DNA strand. PNAs have also been found to replace DNA probes in varied investigative purposes. There are several disadvantages regarding cellular uptake of PNA, so modifications in PNA backbone or covalent coupling with cell penetrating peptides is necessary to improve its delivery inside the cells.

Slight yellow extraocular exudates were observed in BALB/c, suggesting the association with similar ocular findings to those of clinical cases.

Many studies have described how coronaviruses enter cells, but information on PEDV invasion strategies remains insufficient. Given that the differences in gene sequences and pathogenicity between classical and mutant strains of PEDV may lead to diverse invasion mechanisms, this study focused on the cellular entry pathways and cellular transport of the PEDV GI and GII subtype strains in Vero cells and IPEC-J2 cells. We first characterized the kinetics of PEDV entry into cells and found that the highest invasion rate of PEDV was approximately 33% in the IPEC-J2 cells and approximately 100% in the Vero cells. To clarify the specific endocytic pathways, systematic research methods were used and showed that PEDV enters cells via the clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis pathways, in which dynamin II, clathrin heavy chain, Eps15, cholesterol, and caveolin-1 were indispensably involved. In addition, lipid raft extraction assay showed that PEDV can also enter cells through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. To investigate the trafficking of internalized PEDV, we found that PEDV entry into cells relied on low pH and internalized virions reached lysosomes through the early endosome\u2013late endosome\u2013lysosome pathway. The results concretely revealed the entry mechanisms of PEDV and provided an insightful theoretical basis for the further understanding of PEDV pathogenesis and guidance for new targets of antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2020-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Xiaona; She, Gaoli; Wu, Tingting; Xue, Chunyi; Cao, Yongchang","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35346aa2228281a39b64a6185827e497e57296a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7011528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32041637/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-020-0739-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV GI","GII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV GI","entry mechanisms of PEDV","kinetics of PEDV entry","Vero cells","mutant strains of PEDV","PEDV invasion strategies","trafficking of internalized PEDV","understanding of PEDV pathogenesis","IPEC-J2 cells","highest invasion rate of PEDV","cellular entry pathways","caveolae-mediated endocytosis pathways","lipid raft-mediated endocytosis","diverse invasion mechanisms","GII subtype strains","pathogenic variant strains","specific endocytic pathways","early endosome","late endosome","cellular transport","internalized virions","lipid raft extraction assay","clathrin heavy chain","lysosomes","guidance","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","low pH","pathogenicity","dynamin","information","study","significant economic loss","systematic research methods","Eps15","cholesterol","new targets of antiviral drugs","global swine industry","gene sequences","insightful theoretical basis","lysosome pathway","addition","differences","emergence","coronaviruses","caveolin","studies","results"],"language":"en"},

Although the phylogeny of PEDV has been investigated extensively at the molecular level, there was no time-calibrated phylogenomic study on the virus. To improve insight into this topic, we analyzed 138 published genome sequences using the Bayesian coalescent analyses as well as Bayesian inferences and maximum likelihood methods. All of the global PEDV isolates were divided into six groups, except for one unclassified isolate. Of the six groups, Groups 1\u20135 comprised pandemic viruses while the remaining Group 6 contained classical isolates. Interestingly, the two clades, both pandemic and classical, consisted of clade-specific amino acid sequences in five genes: ORF1a, ORF1b, S, ORF3, and N. Within the pandemic clade, Group 1 and Group 2 originated from North America, whereas Group 3\u2013Group 5 were derived from Asia. In Group 2, there was a common origin of S INDEL isolates. Within each group, there was no apparent association between temporal or geographic origin and heterogeneity of PEDVs. Our findings also showed that the PEDV virus evolved at a rate of 3.38 \u00D7 10(\u22124) substitutions/site/year, and the most recent common ancestor of the virus emerged 75.9 years ago. Our Bayesian skyline plot analysis indicated that the PEDV had maintained constant effective population size excluding only a short period, around 2012, when a valley shaped decline in the effective number of infections occurred.

Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 30,994 children (aged 0\u201318 years) with CAP between 2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP, macrolide-less effective MP (MLEP), and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after initiation of macrolide treatment, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests. RESULTS: MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015), the rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia. In children \u003C 2 years of age, RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP, followed by MP (9.4%); however, MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2\u201318 years of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia, and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides fundamental data to establish public health policies to decrease the disease burden due to CAP and improve pediatric health.","publish_time":"2020-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Eun; Kim, Chul-Hong; Lee, Yong Ju; Kim, Hyo-Bin; Kim, Bong-Seong; Kim, Hyung Young; Kim, Yunsun; Kim, Sangyoung; Park, Chorong; Seo, Ju-Hee; Sol, In Suk; Sung, Myongsoon; Song, Min Seob; Song, Dae Jin; Ahn, Young Min; Oh, Hea Lin; Yu, Jinho; Jung, Sungsu; Lee, Kyung Suk; Lee, Ju Suk; Jang, Gwang Cheon; Jang, Yoon-Young; Chung, Eun Hee; Chung, Hai Lee; Choi, Sung-Min; Choi, Yun Jung; Han, Man Yong; Shim, Jung Yeon; Kim, Jin Tack; Kim, Chang-Keun; Yang, Hyeon-Jong","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5da7956e10ac1b78cc0fda6f4043ea034227459e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7017508.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32050912/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-4810-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","MRMP"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["epidemics of MP pneumonia","total MP pneumonia","RSV pneumonia","effective MP","macrolide-refractory MP","macrolide-sensitive MP","MRMP pneumonia","common cause of CAP","cases of adenovirus pneumonia","etiologies of pediatric CAP","children","years of age","initiation of macrolide treatment","macrolide sensitivity tests","results of","pediatric health","disease burden","ventilator care","present study","retrospective study","rate of hospitalization","intensive care units","public health policies","rates of clinical MLEP","fundamental data","fever duration","leading worldwide causes of childhood morbidity","seasonal patterns","etiology","increasing trends","respiratory syncytial virus","mortality","nationwide hospitals","South Korea","CONCLUSIONS","time dependent","Community","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","METHODS","BACKGROUND","identified pathogens of","Systemic corticosteroid"],"language":"en"},

Also, the interactions among nucleotides are neglected in most methods. Here we propose a new Accumulated Natural Vector (ANV) method which represents each DNA sequence by a point in \u211D(18). By calculating the Accumulated Indicator Functions of nucleotides, we can further find an Accumulated Natural Vector for each sequence. This new Accumulated Natural Vector not only can capture the distribution of each nucleotide, but also provide the covariance among nucleotides. Thus global comparison of DNA sequences or genomes can be done easily in \u211D(18).

We conducted laboratory-based surveillance of viral etiology for ILI outpatients in Shanghai from January 2011 to December 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and epidemiological data from ILI outpatients, both children and adults, were collected. A total of 1970 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested for 12 respiratory viruses using multiplex RT-PCR, and the data were analyzed anonymously. RESULTS: All 12 respiratory viruses were detected in the specimens. At least one virus was detected in 32.4% of 1970 specimens analyzed, with 1.1% showing co-infections. The most frequently detected agents were influenza A (11.7%), influenza B (9.6%), and rhinoviruses (3.1%).Other viruses were present at a frequency less than 3.0%. We observed a winter peak in the detection rate in ILI patients during 3 years of surveillance and a summer peak in 2012. HCoV, HADV, and HMPV were detected more frequently in children than in adults. Patients infected with influenza virus experienced higher temperatures, more coughs, running noses, headaches and fatigue than patients infected with other viruses and virus-free patients (p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum, seasonality, age distribution and clinical associations of respiratory virus infections in children and adults with influenza-like illness were analyzed in this study for the first time. To a certain extent, the findings can provide baseline data for evaluating the burden of respiratory virus infection in children and adults in Shanghai. It will also provide clinicians with helpful information about the etiological patterns of outpatients presenting with complaints of acute respiratory syndrome, but further studies should be conducted, and longer-term laboratory-based surveillance would give a better picture of the etiology of ILI.","publish_time":"2015-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Yifei; Pan, Lifeng; Sun, Qiao; Zhu, Weiping; Zhu, Linying; Ye, Chuchu; Xue, Caoyi; Wang, Yuanping; Liu, Qing; Ma, Ping; Qiu, Huifang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc55e7876326722cc7c5ad2a88a8d2217c296596.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4379014.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25822885/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0119513","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":["China","Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["ILI outpatients","ILI patients","respiratory viruses","children","adults","etiology of ILI","virus-free patients","clinical associations of respiratory virus infections","burden of respiratory virus infection","influenza B","etiological characteristics of influenza","influenza virus experienced higher temperatures","detected agents","etiological patterns of outpatients","years of surveillance","complaints of acute respiratory syndrome","laboratory-based surveillance of viral etiology","longer-term laboratory-based surveillance","epidemiological data","baseline data","illness","Shanghai","specimens","winter peak","summer peak","age distribution","seasonality","coughs","detection rate","noses","better picture","multiplex RT-PCR","helpful information","spectrum","findings","headaches","studies","METHODS","fatigue","southern temperate region of China","clinicians","MATERIALS","HMPV","INTRODUCTION","certain extent","total","nasopharyngeal swabs","HCoV","HADV","CONCLUSIONS","study","frequency","RESULTS","time","rhinoviruses"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Intranasal inoculation of nonadapted H1N1 virus into C57BL, BALB/c and CD\u20101 mice caused infection in all three species. Respiratory exposure of CD\u20101 mice to the aerosolized virus at graduated doses was accomplished in a modified rodent exposure apparatus. Weight change was recorded for 7 days postexposure, and viral populations in lung tissue homogenates were measured post mortem by DNA amplification (qRT\u2010PCR), direct fluorescence and microscopic evaluation of cytopathic effect. Plots of weight change and of PCR cycle threshold vs delivered dose were linear to threshold doses of ~40 TCID (50) and ~12 TCID (50), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MID (50) for inspired H1N1 aerosols in CD\u20101 mice is between 12 and 40 TCID (50); proportionality to dose of weight loss and viral populations makes the CD\u20101 mouse a useful model for measuring infectivity by inhalation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In the CATS, this mouse\u2013virus model provides the first quantitative method to evaluate the ability of respiratory protective technologies to attenuate the infectivity of an inspired pathogenic aerosol.","publish_time":"2012-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"McDonald, R.S.; Sambol, A.R.; Heimbuch, B.K.; Brown, T.L.; Hinrichs, S.H.; Wander, J.D.","journal":"J Appl Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46427cb9407b83f3a21fa156fcfb9a33e743b65d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166995.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05402.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22809111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus model","infectivity","aerosolized virus","mice","TCID","Respiratory exposure of CD","Intranasal inoculation of nonadapted H1N1 virus","animal model","viral populations","useful model","threshold doses","inspired H1N1 aerosols","weight loss","CATS","mouse","Plots of weight change","study","inspired pathogenic aerosol","PCR cycle threshold vs","graduated doses","aerosolized human pathogen","Controlled Aerosol Test System","ability of respiratory protective technologies","modified rodent exposure apparatus","post mortem","qRT","C57BL","lung tissue homogenates","direct fluorescence","BALB","DNA amplification","microscopic evaluation of cytopathic effect","RESULTS","days postexposure","quantitative method","influenza","prototype tool","METHODS","proportionality","inhalation","infection","SIGNIFICANCE","IMPACT","species","CONCLUSIONS","aim"],"language":"en"},

Eight high-temperature indices, including three single measurements (average, maximum and minimum temperature) and five composite indices (heat index, humidex, temperature humidity index, apparent temperature and wet-bulb globe temperature), and their standardized Z scores, were used in distributed lag non-linear models. Cumulative 8-day (lag zero to seven days) relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated, 1 and 2 standardized deviations above the medium (i.e., at 84.1th and 97.7th percentile, respectively), by comparing with Z scores for the lowest risks of mortality and outpatient visits as references. Analyses were performed for Taipei in north, Central Taiwan and Southern Taiwan. Results showed that standardized Z-values of high-temperature indices associated with the lowest health risk were approximately 0 in Taipei and Central Taiwan, and \u22121 in Southern Taiwan. As the apparent temperature was at Z=2, the cumulative 8-day mortality risk increased significantly, by 23% in Taipei and 28% in Southern Taiwan, but not in Central Taiwan. The maximum temperature displayed consistently a high correlation with all-cause outpatient visits at Z=1; with the cumulative 8-day RRs for outpatient visits increased by 7%, 3%, and 4% in the three corresponding areas. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated methods to compare multiple high-temperature indices associated with all-cause mortality and outpatient visits for population residing in a subtropical island. Apparent temperature is an optimal indicator for predicting all-cause mortality risk, and maximum temperature is recommended to associate with outpatient visits. The impact of heat varied with study areas, evaluated health outcomes, and high-temperature indices. The increased extreme heat is associated with stronger risk for all-cause mortality than for outpatient visits.","publish_time":"2012-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Yu-Kai; Chang, Chin-Kuo; Li, Ming-Hsu; Wu, Yu-Chung; Wang, Yu-Chun","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e4a05b0bb552c2008870b965dad8605710fce2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127034.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.04.039; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969712005712; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969712005712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22575378/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Taipei","Central Taiwan","Southern Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["apparent temperature","maximum temperature","minimum temperature","optimal high-temperature indices","multiple high-temperature indices","all-cause outpatient visits","temperature humidity index","all-cause mortality risk","risks of all-cause mortality","Central Taiwan","Southern Taiwan","day mortality risk","wet-bulb globe temperature","lowest risks of mortality","composite indices","high correlation","standardized Z scores","standardized Z-values","Taipei","lowest health risk","heat index","stronger risk","day RRs","study areas","increased extreme heat","relative risks","impact of heat","standardized deviations","optimal indicator","subtropical islanders","health outcomes","th percentile","corresponding areas","distributed lag non-linear models","humidex","north","population","single measurements","average","days","methods","warm seasons","Results","references","confidence intervals","conclusion","Analyses"],"language":"en"},

However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients. METHODS: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the \u201CDiagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6(th) edition)\u201D issued by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined. . RESULTS: Clinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease. Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902). CONCLUSIONS: Detectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis. Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory response.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xiaohua; Zhao, Binghong; Qu, Yueming; Chen, Yurou; Xiong, Jie; Feng, Yong; Men, Dong; Huang, Qianchuan; Liu, Ying; Yang, Bo; Ding, Jinya; Li, Feng","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6a4965d0daade3bc8b3dd6a7f09444623baef00.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301997/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa449","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLA","New Coronavirus Pneumonia","RNA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ill patients","elevated IL","high IL","detection of RNAaemia","specific class of patients","level of inflammatory cytokine IL","cases of COVID","fraction of COVID","Detectable serum SARS-Cov","detection of SARS","serum viral load","ill group","coronavirus disease","occurrence of cytokine storms","larger cytokine storm","designated hospital","Clinical characteristics analysis","excessive inflammatory response","Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia","National Health Commission of China","General Hospital of Central Theater Command","PLA","Diagnosis","nucleic acid","potential therapeutic target","Wuhan","concentration","outcome","CONCLUSIONS","poor prognosis","respiratory specimens","edition","RESULTS","levels","study","severity","laboratory data","testing","METHODS","groups","BACKGROUND","times"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to define the antiviral activity of V\u03B42 T-cells against ZIKV-infected cells. The V\u03B42 T-cells expansion and their cytotoxic activity against ZIKV-infected cells were tested in vitro and analyzed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. We found that ZIKV infection was able to induce V\u03B42 T-cells expansion and sensitized A549 cells to V\u03B42-mediated killing. Indeed, expanded V\u03B42 T-cells killed ZIKV-infected cells through degranulation and perforin release. Moreover, ZIKV infection was able to increase the expression on A549 cells of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs), namely MICA, MICB, and ULBP2, at both the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting the possible involvement of these molecules in the recognition by NKG2D-expressing V\u03B42 T-cells. Indeed, the killing of ZIKV-infected cells by expanded V\u03B42 T-cells was mediated by NKG2D/NKG2DL interaction as NKG2D neutralization abrogated V\u03B42 cytotoxicity. Our data showed a strong antiviral activity of V\u03B42 T-cells against ZIKV-infected cells, suggesting their involvement in the protective immune response.

Since many outbreaks of infectious diseases last only six to eight weeks, there is a need for trial designs that can be implemented rapidly in the face of uncertainty. Outbreaks are sudden and unpredictable and so it is essential that as much planning as possible takes place in advance. Statistical aspects of such trial designs should be evaluated and discussed in readiness for implementation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This paper proposes a generic ordinal sequential trial design (GOST) for a randomised clinical trial comparing an experimental treatment for an emerging infectious disease with standard care. The design is intended as an off-the-shelf, ready-to-use robust and flexible option. The primary endpoint is a categorisation of patient outcome according to an ordinal scale. A sequential approach is adopted, stopping as soon as it is clear that the experimental treatment has an advantage or that sufficient advantage is unlikely to be detected. The properties of the design are evaluated using large-sample theory and verified for moderate sized samples using simulation. The trial is powered to detect a generic clinically relevant difference: namely an odds ratio of 2 for better rather than worse outcomes. Total sample sizes (across both treatments) of between 150 and 300 patients prove to be adequate in many cases, but the precise value depends on both the magnitude of the treatment advantage and the nature of the ordinal scale. An advantage of the approach is that any erroneous assumptions made at the design stage about the proportion of patients falling into each outcome category have little effect on the error probabilities of the study, although they can lead to inaccurate forecasts of sample size. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: It is important and feasible to pre-determine many of the statistical aspects of an efficient trial design in advance of a disease outbreak. The design can then be tailored to the specific disease under study once its nature is better understood.","publish_time":"2017-03-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whitehead, John; Horby, Peter","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab2e4c7ae023d55fde4ae3df32825484d00fcb3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5360336.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28278301/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005439","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficient trial design","trial designs","generic ordinal sequential trial design","design stage","treatment advantage","randomised clinical trial","experimental treatments","sufficient advantage","ordinal scale","emerging infectious disease","outbreaks of infectious diseases","advance","specific disease","disease outbreak","Statistical aspects","pandemic infectious diseases","nature","sequential approach","study","large-sample theory","Total sample sizes","outcome category","clinical trials","inaccurate forecasts of sample size","proportion of patients","categorisation of patient outcome","GOST","paper","little effect","moderate sized samples","error probabilities","planning","relevant difference","standard care","erroneous assumptions","magnitude","primary endpoint","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","cases","SIGNIFICANCE","precise value","odds ratio","simulation","METHODOLOGY","place","need","flexible option","CONCLUSIONS","weeks","BACKGROUND","face of uncertainty","readiness","implementation","worse outcomes","properties"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Two groups of hospitalised children were included in this study: group 1 consisted of 1946 children hospitalised from 1st September 2004 to 30th May 2005, and group 2 consisted of 448 children hospitalised from 1st November 2003 to 30th March 2004. The respiratory specimens were tested by polymerase chain reaction. Results: In the first group, HBoV was detected by polymerise chain reaction in 11/828 (1.3%) of nasal specimens that tested negative for other respiratory viruses. One child tested positive for HBoV in both a nasal aspirate and stool sample. In the second group, nasal specimens were tested for all respiratory viruses, including HBoV. The presence of HBoV infection was detected in seven children (1.6%). Detection of a mixed viral population was observed in four of these children. The main symptoms in children infected with HBoV were rhinitis (50%), cough (45%), dyspnoea (28%), wheezing (28%), fever (23%) and diarrhoea (22%). The final clinical diagnoses were bronchiolitis (seven children), rhinopharyngitis (five children), the exacerbation of asthma (two children) and pneumonia (one child). Moreover, four children have associated gastroenteritis. Conclusion: These results contribute to the interest in the HBoV detection in children. HBoV detection in hospitalised children with or without any other respiratory virus detection was essentially associated with lower respiratory tract infection and in a lower score with upper respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis.","publish_time":"2009-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dina, Julia; Vabret, Astrid; Gouarin, Stephanie; Petitjean, Joelle; Lecoq, Julie; Brouard, Jacques; Arion, Alina; Lafay\u2010Delaire, Fran\u00E7oise; Freymuth, Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"J Paediatr Child Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb5c68317a40ee5d20b73ed78f71cc272b49385d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167115.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1754.2008.01442.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19210599/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of HBoV","HBoV detection","groups of hospitalised children","presence of HBoV infection","respiratory specimens","respiratory viruses","respiratory virus detection","lower respiratory tract infection","upper respiratory tract infection","nasal specimens","study","clinical symptoms","nasal aspirate","gastroenteritis","Results","polymerase chain reaction","lower score","main symptoms","final clinical diagnoses","bronchiolitis","frequency of human bocavirus","exacerbation of asthma","stool sample","mixed viral population","pneumonia","Methods","rhinitis","rhinopharyngitis","cough","fever","diarrhoea","dyspnoea","Conclusion","objectives"],"language":"en"},

Immortalized cell lines were generated; their potential to induce and react on IFN was confirmed, and biological assays were adapted to application in bat cell cultures, enabling comparison of landmark IFN properties with that of common mammalian cell lines. E. helvum cells were fully capable of reacting to viral and artificial IFN stimuli. E. helvum cells showed highest IFN mRNA induction, highly productive IFN protein secretion, and evidence of efficient IFN stimulated gene induction. In an Alphavirus infection model, O\u0027nyong-nyong virus exhibited strong IFN induction but evaded the IFN response by translational rather than transcriptional shutoff, similar to other Alphavirus infections.

To date, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the risk factors (RFs), as well as the most critical period for subsequent onset of IFD after CARV infections in allo\u2010HSCT recipients. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal observational CARV survey, we analyzed the effect of CARV on subsequent IFD development in 287 adult allo\u2010HSCT recipients diagnosed with 597 CARV episodes from December 2013 to December 2018. Multiplex PCR panel assays were used to test CARVs in respiratory specimens. FINDINGS: Twenty\u2010nine out of 287 allo\u2010HSCT recipients (10%) developed IFD after a CARV episode. The median time of IFD onset was 21 days (range, 0\u2010158 days) from day of the first CARV detection. Generalized estimating equation model identified 4 risk factors for IFD: ATG\u2010based conditioning regimen [odds ratio (OR) 2.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05\u20105.2, P = .038], CARV lower respiratory tract disease (OR 10.6, 95% CI 3.7\u201030.8, P \u003C .0001), CARV infection during the first year after transplant (OR 5.34, 95% CI 1.3\u201021.8, P = .014), and corticosteroids during CARV (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1\u20106.3, P = .03). CONCLUSION: Allo\u2010HSCT recipients conditioned with ATG and under corticosteroid therapy at the time of CARV LRTD during the first year after transplant may require close monitoring for subsequent IFD.","publish_time":"2019-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pi\u00F1ana, Jos\u00E9 Luis; G\u00F3mez, Mar\u00EDa Dolores; Montoro, Juan; Lorenzo, Ignacio; P\u00E9rez, Ariadna; Gim\u00E9nez, Estela; Gonz\u00E1lez\u2010Barber\u00E1, Eva Mar\u00EDa; Carretero, Carlos; Guerreiro, Manuel; Salavert, Miguel; Sanz, Guillermo; Hern\u00E1ndez\u2010Boluda, Juan Carlos; Borr\u00E1s, Rafael; Sanz, Jaime; Solano, Carlos; Navarro, David","journal":"Transpl Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e074fa6fb8acfc49fe8dbfd27ba0c1fce47bca03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402532/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13158","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CARV","Multiplex PCR","IFD","ATG","CARV LRTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CARV infections","effect of CARV","CARV episodes","CARV detection","time of CARV LRTD","HSCT recipients","subsequent onset of IFD","subsequent IFD development","CARV lower respiratory tract disease","adult allo","median time of IFD onset","prospective longitudinal observational CARV survey","risk factors","ATG","year","respiratory virus","respiratory specimens","days","risk of pulmonary invasive fungal disease","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","based conditioning regimen","odds ratio","corticosteroid therapy","close monitoring","estimating equation model","CARVs","evidence","lack of knowledge","community","critical period","range","Multiplex PCR panel assays","METHODS","RFs","setting","CONCLUSION","confidence interval","corticosteroids","BACKGROUND","date","FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to identify risk factors associated with exposure to BRD pathogens during the peri-weaning period (day (d)-14 to d 14 relative to weaning at 0) in dairy bull calves using serological responses to these pathogens as surrogate markers of exposure. Clinically normal Holstein-Friesian and Jersey breed bull calves (n = 72) were group housed in 4 pens using a factorial design with calves of different breeds and planes of nutrition in each pen. Intrinsic, management and clinical data were collected during the pre-weaning (d \u2212 56 to d \u2212 14) period. Calves were gradually weaned over 14 days (d \u2212 14 to d 0). Serological analysis for antibodies against key BRD pathogens (BRSV, BPI3V, BHV-1, BHV-4, BCoV, BVDV and H. somni) was undertaken at d \u2212 14 and d 14. Linear regression models (for BVDV, BPI3V, BHV-1, BHV-4, BCoV and H. somni) and a single mixed effect random variable model (for BRSV) were used to identify risk factors for changes in antibody levels to these pathogens. RESULTS: BRSV was the only pathogen which demonstrated clustering by pen. Jersey calves experienced significantly lower changes in BVDV S/P than Holstein-Friesian calves. Animals with a high maximum respiratory score (\u22658) recorded significant increases in H. somni S/P during the peri-weaning period when compared to those with respiratory scores of \u22643. Haptoglobin levels of between 1.32 and 1.60 mg/ml at d \u2212 14 were significantly associated with decreases in BHV-1 S/N during the peri-weaning period. Higher BVDV S/P ratios at d \u2212 14 were significantly correlated with increased changes in serological responses to BHV-4 over the peri-weaning period. CONCLUSIONS: Haptoglobin may have potential as a predictor of exposure to BHV-1. BRSV would appear to play a more significant role at the \u2018group\u2019 rather than \u2018individual animal\u2019 level. The significant associations between the pre-weaning levels of antibodies to certain BRD pathogens and changes in the levels of antibodies to the various pathogens during the peri-weaning period may reflect a cohort of possibly genetically linked \u2018better responders\u2019 among the study population.","publish_time":"2018-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murray, Gerard M.; More, Simon J.; Clegg, Tracy A.; Earley, Bernadette; O\u2019Neill, R\u00F3nan G.; Johnston, Dayle; Gilmore, John; Nosov, Mikhail; McElroy, M\u00E1ire C.; Inzana, Thomas J.; Cassidy, Joseph P.","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2fb6867057dd0152657070fde0a4ab564d375c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5828089.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1372-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29482563/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRD","BRSV","BVDV S/P","H. somni S/P"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BHV","peri-weaning period","pre-weaning levels of antibodies","Jersey calves","Holstein-Friesian calves","BRSV","key BRD pathogens","certain BRD pathogens","various pathogens","somni S","Higher BVDV S","dairy bull calves","Haptoglobin levels","Jersey breed bull calves","calves of different breeds","lower changes","serological responses","increased changes","antibody levels","P ratios","BPI3V","Serological analysis","risk factors","predictor of exposure","significant increases","significant associations","group","significant role","respiratory scores","BCoV","surrogate markers of exposure","Bovine respiratory disease","high maximum respiratory score","study population","single mixed effect random variable model","factorial design","planes of nutrition","clinical data","Animals","potential","pens","BACKGROUND","leading causes of death","Linear regression models","better responders\u2019","cattle","management","individual animal","cohort","days","clustering","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","decreases","objective"],"language":"en"},

Zinc has a necessary role in the replication of many viruses, however, antiviral action of zinc has also been demonstrated in in vitro infection models most likely through induction of host antiviral responses. Therefore, depending on the host machinery that the virus employs at different stages of infection, zinc may either facilitate, or inhibit virus infection. In this study, we show that zinc plays divergent roles in rotavirus and dengue virus infections in epithelial cells. Dengue virus infection did not perturb the epithelial barrier functions despite the release of virus from the basolateral surface whereas rotavirus infection led to disruption of epithelial junctions. In rotavirus infection, zinc supplementation post-infection did not block barrier disruption suggesting that zinc does not affect rotavirus life-cycle or protects epithelial barriers post-infection suggesting the involvement of cellular pathways in the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation in enteric infections. Zinc depletion by N,N,N\u0027,N\u0027-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN) inhibited dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection but had no effect on rotavirus. Time-of-addition experiments suggested that zinc chelation affected both early and late stages of dengue virus infectious cycle and zinc chelation abrogated dengue virus RNA replication. We show that transient zinc chelation induces ER stress and antiviral response by activating NF-kappaB leading to induction of interferon signaling. These results suggest that modulation of zinc homeostasis during virus infection could be a component of host antiviral response and altering zinc homeostasis may act as a potent antiviral strategy against flaviviruses.","publish_time":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kar, Meenakshi; Khan, Naseem Ahmed; Panwar, Aleksha; Bais, Sachendra S.; Basak, Soumen; Goel, Renu; Sopory, Shailaja; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8ae86b48db5e9860652f9c78c61f13c1b41c700.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6779808.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632411/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.02347","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rotavirus infection","Zinc depletion","zinc supplementation post-infection","antiviral action of zinc","dengue virus infections","transient zinc chelation","modulation of zinc homeostasis","release of virus","infection models","zinc chelation abrogated dengue virus RNA replication","beneficial effect of zinc supplementation","different stages of infection","epithelial barriers post-infection","Japanese encephalitis virus","late stages of dengue virus infectious cycle","component of host antiviral response","induction of host antiviral responses","rotavirus life-cycle","epithelial barrier functions","epithelial cells","disruption of epithelial junctions","potent antiviral strategy","barrier disruption","enteric infections","viral infections","host machinery","induction of interferon","crucial role","necessary role","diverse physiological functions","ER stress","involvement of cellular pathways","JEV","basolateral surface","divergent roles","essential micronutrient","NF-kappaB","addition experiments","ethanediamine","TPEN","flaviviruses","tetrakis","results","pyridinylmethyl","Time","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: One week after the lockdown was announced, we conducted an anonymous online survey of the orthopaedic surgeons in India through social media platforms to assess the impact of the lockdown during COVID 19. The survey had a total of 13 questions with (3\u20135) options and was designed with an aim to understand the perception and the state of mind of the Orthopaedic surgeons in the lockdown situation. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 611 orthopaedic surgeons from 140 cities in India. There were 22.5% orthopaedic surgeons who said that they were definitely stressed out, and 40.5% who said they were mildly stressed out. As the age decreased, the percentage of orthopaedic surgeons feeling \u201Cdefinitely stressed out\u201D increased. Disruption of life-work balance and uncertainties regarding return to work were other strongly associated factors with the \u201Cdefinitely stressed out\u201D group. CONCLUSION: The psychological impact of the lockdown during COVID 19 on orthopaedic surgeons may become a potential concern that will require addressal through open discussion.

Infection may occur with or without evidence of disease. Disease may represent only the \u201Ctip of the iceberg\u201D of infection. Prevalence of disease is the proportion of a defined population that meets specific criteria at a point in time, and incidence refers to the proportion of a defined population in which the onset occurs during a specifiable interval. Risk is an instantaneous rate of incidence. Prevalence, incidence, and risk in infectious diseases are quantitative inferences derived from assessment of implications \u2014 caveats derived from variables that often are elusive, such as antibiotic resistance to plasmid mediated determinants transferable between species of enteric bacteria, or such as increases in population density among insect vectors influenced by climatic conditions favorable to the insects. Carefully orchestrated manipulation of the etiologic agent or the host response is made possible by ever-expanding understanding of the molecular biology of pathogenicity on the one hand and cellular and humoral immunity on the other. Such understanding often leads to new caveats or destroys old ones based on incomplete information. This paper deals with a selected limited number of infectious diseases of dairy cattle. Knowledge developed around the cited parameters in 13 infectious diseases during the past quarter century is brought into focus. Ten geographically dispersed specialists in infectious diseases of cattle were asked to identify priorities among the array of transmissible diseases important to North America. Except for the mastitis syndrome, which will be given special attention elsewhere in these anniversary papers, the diseases discussed are those wherein major advances in knowledge or major needs for advanced knowledge were of special importance.","publish_time":"1981-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poppensiek, George C.; Kahrs, Robert F.","journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1b414ea9f67ca2b5b6d9c496378a9d38dd69c80.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030281827142; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030281827142","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America"],"keyphrases":["infectious diseases of cattle","Prevalence of disease","defined population","selected limited number of infectious diseases of dairy cattle","evidence of disease","Abstract Disease","array of transmissible diseases important","advanced knowledge","Risk","population density","proportion","Infection","instantaneous rate of incidence","major needs","major advances","ever-expanding understanding","special attention","new caveats","special importance","species of enteric bacteria","plasmid mediated determinants transferable","antibiotic resistance","insect vectors","quantitative inferences","host response","climatic conditions favorable","hand","etiologic agent","old ones","molecular biology of pathogenicity","assessment of implications","specific criteria","past quarter century","North America","functional integrity","paper deals","manifestation of insult","point","time","onset","anniversary papers","priorities","dispersed specialists","cited parameters","humoral immunity","living","orchestrated manipulation","incomplete information","insects","focus","variables","caribou","tip","cats","specifiable interval","iceberg","mastitis syndrome"],"language":"en"},

One such protein is SARS-CoV nsp1, which is processed from the N-terminus of both pp1a and pp1ab. The mature SARS-CoV protein is present in cells several hours post-infection and co-localizes to the viral replication complex, but its function in the viral life cycle remains unknown. Furthermore, nsp1 sequences are highly divergent across the CoV family, and it has been suggested that this is due to nsp1 possessing a function specific to viral interactions with its host cell or acting as a host specific virulence factor. In order to initiate structural and biophysical studies of SARS-CoV nsp1, a recombinant expression system and a purification protocol have been developed, yielding milligram quantities of highly purified SARS-CoV nsp1.

We previously reported that IRF-3-dependent host innate immune responses partially interfere in infection of prions. Here, we found that stable infection of prion suppressed IRF-3 gene-expression. The decreased promoter activity of IRF-3 was significantly restored along with treatment of anti-prion drugs in the prion-infected cells, suggesting that infection of prion directly influence the regulation of IRF-3 transcription. We further investigated promoter activity of 5\u2032- flanking region of murine IRF-3 using a luciferase reporter system and found that the nucleotides -119 to -1 were indispensable for the promoter activity. Within this region, mutations in the Oct-1 binding site significantly reduced the promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that Oct-1 indeed binds to the region. In addition, overexpression of Oct-1 increased the promoter activity of IRF-3. Intriguingly, Oct-1 protein was significantly reduced in prion-infected cells and mice brains compared with uninfected groups. Taken together, we concluded that prion infection could interfere in the function of Oct-1, resulting in the down-regulation of IRF-3.","publish_time":"2014-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Homma, Takujiro; Ishibashi, Daisuke; Nakagaki, Takehiro; Fuse, Takayuki; Sano, Kazunori; Satoh, Katsuya; Atarashi, Ryuichiro; Nishida, Noriyuki","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f8f7f09b42b4b45e128591191176aa358f29b1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4126003.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep06006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25103253/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prion infection","regulation of IRF","decreased promoter activity of IRF","stable infection of prion","prion-infected cells","flanking region of murine IRF","infection of prions","treatment of anti-prion drugs","invasion of various viruses","mice brains","interferon regulatory factor","chromatin immunoprecipitation","ChIP","immune responses","prompt response","dependent host","luciferase reporter system","uninfected groups","binding site","assay","gene-expression","Interferons","IFN","nucleotides","mutations","transcription","function","cell types","addition","overexpression","protein"],"language":"en"},

Methods Our study (NCT04252885, named ELACOI), was an exploratory randomized (2:2:1) controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or arbidol monotherapy for treating patients with mild/moderate COVID-19. Findings This study successfully enrolled 86 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 with 34 randomly assigned to receive LPV/r, 35 to arbidol and 17 with no antiviral medication as control. Baseline characteristics of the three groups were comparable. The primary endpoint, the rate of positive-to-negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, was similar between groups (all P\u003E0.05). There were no differences between groups in the secondary endpoints, the rates of antipyresis, cough alleviation, or improvement of chest CT at days 7 or 14 (all P\u003E0.05). At day 7, eight (23.5%) patients in the LPV/r group, 3 (8.6%) in the arbidol group and 2(11.8%) in the control group showed a deterioration in clinical status from moderate to severe/critical (P =0.206). Overall, 12 (35.3%) patients in the LPV/r group and 5 (14.3%) in the arbidol group experienced adverse events during the follow-up period. No apparent adverse event occurred in the control group.

As of Feb 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths). MERS-CoV features prominently in the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens that threaten global health security. Although primary transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is linked to exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), the exact mode by which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains undefined. Up to 50% of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV. Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection. The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections. Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV. The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths. This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East.

With 10 million pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia each year from 182 countries, watchful surveillance by public health systems, and a high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection is essential.

IT has also been applied to high-level correlations that combine DNA, RNA or protein features with sequence-independent properties, such as gene mapping and phenotype analysis, and has also provided models based on communication systems theory to describe information transmission channels at the cell level and also during evolutionary processes. While not exhaustive, this review attempts to categorize existing methods and to indicate their relation with broader transversal topics such as genomic signatures, data compression and complexity, time series analysis and phylogenetic classification, providing a resource for future developments in this promising area.","publish_time":"2013-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vinga, Susana","journal":"Brief Bioinform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0eecd773d0c49ad6d1cfc9f3dd480394f6673bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109941.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbt068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24058049/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["local analysis","phenotype analysis","analysis of communication systems","alignment-free sequence analysis","time series analysis","genome global analysis","Information theory","sequence characterization","comparison","communication systems theory","mutual information","sequence-independent properties","information transmission channels","linguistic complexity","phylogenetic classification","classification of motifs","review attempts","resolution-free metrics","block-entropy estimation","genomic signatures","data compression","RNA","cell level","protein features","sites","prediction of transcription factor","iterative maps","broader transversal topics","DNA","resource","gene mapping","applications","future developments","existing methods","models","promising area","entropic profiles","high-level correlations","evolutionary processes","aspects","concepts"],"language":"en"},

Here we developed a pilot-scale production of a purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine candidate (PiCoVacc), which induced SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats and non-human primates. These antibodies neutralized 10 representative SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting a possible broader neutralizing ability against SARS-CoV-2 strains. Three immunizations using two different doses (3 \u03BCg or 6 \u03BCg per dose) provided partial or complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, respectively, without observable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.

In particular, low intrinsic mortality risks on islands with reduced predator numbers and not subject to harsh winter climates may in principle support the development of stocks with extended longevity. Conversely, the conditions under which laboratory rodents are typically bred are thought to select for genotypes that produce large, rapidly maturing races with high early reproductive rates but diminished longevity. To test these ideas, and to generate new mouse stocks suitable for genetic and molecular analysis of the processes that time life\u2010history events, we have developed specific pathogen\u2010free stocks from mice trapped from three distinct populations: the U.S. mainland (Idaho) and the tropical Pacific islands Majuro and Pohnpei. Mice from all three locations were found to be shorter and lighter, to have smaller litters, and to have higher faecal corticosterone levels than mice of a genetically heterogeneous stock derived from four common laboratory inbred strains. Among the wild\u2010derived stocks, mice from Pohnpei and Majuro were significantly lighter and shorter than Idaho\u2010derived animals, even in populations kept from birth under identical housing conditions. Litter size and reproductive success rates did not differ significantly among the three wild\u2010derived stocks. Although further work will be needed to see if, as predicted, the wild\u2010derived stocks differ from one another and from laboratory mice in longevity, these stocks provide useful tools for genetic dissection of factors that regulate body size and reproductive success.","publish_time":"2006-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, Richard A.; Dysko, Robert; Chrisp, Clarence; Seguin, Renee; Linsalata, Luann; Buehner, Gretchen; Harper, James M.; Austad, Steven","journal":"J Zool (1987)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f04e27ad51b6f85f0696b21c808852d78e1d5ca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336890/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2000.tb00580.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S.","Idaho"],"keyphrases":["derived stocks","development of stocks","free stocks","laboratory mice","body size","litter size","derived animals","new mouse stocks suitable","diminished longevity","extended longevity","reproductive success rates","isolated islands","rodent populations","distinct populations","Idaho","Pohnpei","laboratory rodents","high early reproductive rates","tropical Pacific islands Majuro","time life","constellations of life","history events","history traits","mainland relatives","common laboratory inbred strains","genetic dissection of factors","identical housing conditions","reduced predator numbers","processes","molecular analysis","low intrinsic mortality risks","maturing races","useful tools","example","harsh winter climates","specific pathogen","access","unoccupied ecological niches","higher faecal corticosterone levels","principle","heterogeneous stock","smaller litters","birth","Founder effects","genotypes","ideas","locations","work"],"language":"en"},

As of January 2020, cases of 2019-nCoV are continuing to be reported in other Eastern Asian countries as well as in the United States, Europe, Australia, and numerous other countries. An unusually high volume of domestic and international travel corresponding to the beginning of the 2020 Chinese New Year complicated initial identification and containment of infected persons. Due to the rapidly rising number of cases and reported deaths, all countries should be considered at risk of imported 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is essential for prehospital, clinic, and emergency department personnel to be able to rapidly assess 2019-nCoV risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, originally conceived for the initial detection and management of Ebola virus and later adjusted for other infectious agents, can be adapted for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I Tool for use in the initial detection and management of patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV. After initial assessment for symptoms and epidemiological risk factors, including travel to affected areas and exposure to confirmed 2019-nCoV patients within 14 days, patients are classified in a risk-stratified system. Upon confirmation of a suspected 2019-nCoV case, affected persons must immediately be placed in airborne infection isolation and the appropriate public health agencies notified. This modified 3I Tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing persons with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV.","publish_time":"2020-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koenig, Kristi L.; Be\u00FF, Christian K.; McDonald, Eric C.","journal":"West J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f323af9a07cc54faf9bdbabadaacb0e8b46f99a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7081861.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.1.46760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["3I Tool"],"locations":["China","Eastern Asian","United States","Europe","Australia"],"keyphrases":["nCoV risk","nCoV patients","nCoV case","initial detection","Tool","initial assessment","management of patients","emerging infectious disease","epidemiological risk factors","risk-stratified system","reported deaths","infectious agents","containment of infected persons","Eastern Asian countries","Chinese New Year complicated initial identification","international travel","MERS-CoV","SARS-CoV","emergency department personnel","management of Ebola virus","rising number of cases","airborne infection isolation","appropriate public health agencies","beginning","Australia","symptoms","Wuhan City","Europe","Hubei Province","China","high volume of domestic","exposure","use","investigation","primary care clinicians","United States","areas","immediate actions","days","modification","hospital providers","Novel Coronavirus","confirmation","paper","Isolate"],"language":"en"},

Noncommercial poultry operations, such as backyard poultry facilities in China, are potential sources of virus exchange between commercial poultry and wild birds. It is particularly critical in wetland areas where backyard poultry have close contact with commercial poultry and migratory birds, therefore increasing the risk of contracting infectious diseases. To evaluate the transmission risks, a cross-sectional study was undertaken in the Poyang Lake area, China, involving 309 residents in the backyard poultry farms in three counties (Region A, B, and C) of Jiangxi Province. We examined the backyard poultry population, poultry species, presence of poultry deaths from infectious diseases, food sources, and biosecurity practices. Region B ranked highest for biosecurity while region C ranked lowest. The risks of infectious diseases were assessed by adjusted odds ratio based on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Potential risk factors in the three regions of the study site were compared. In Region A, significant factor was contact of poultry with wild birds (OR: 6.573, 95% CI: 2.148\u201320.115, P=0.001). In Region B, the most significant factor was contact of poultry with neighboring backyard waterfowls (OR: 3.967, 95% CI: 1.555\u201310.122, P=0.004). In Region C, significant factors were poultry purchase from local live bird markets (OR: 3.740, 95% CI: 1.243\u201311.255, P=0.019), and contact of poultry with wild birds (OR: 3.379, 95% CI: 1.058\u201310.791, P=0.040). In summary, backyard poultry was significantly affected by neighboring commercial poultry and close contact with wild birds. The results are expected to improve our understanding of the transmission risks of infectious diseases in a typical backyard poultry environment in rural China, and address the need to improve local farming practices and take preventive measures.","publish_time":"2013-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yong; Jiang, Zhiben; Jin, Zhenyu; Tan, Hua; Xu, Bing","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a523dca1cc7a585e2433acb959f3d396f35b9c79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3688663.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23840680/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Poyang Lake","China"],"keyphrases":["contact of poultry","poultry purchase","poultry species","poultry industry","backyard poultry facilities","backyard poultry farms","backyard poultry population","typical backyard poultry environment","presence of poultry deaths","Noncommercial poultry operations","wild birds","region C","Region B","transmission of infectious diseases","transmission risks of infectious diseases","close contact","migratory birds","neighboring backyard waterfowls","significant factors","rural China","biosecurity practices","Potential risk factors","local farming practices","food sources","potential sources of virus exchange","cross-sectional study","study site","local live bird markets","adjusted odds ratio","multivariate logistic regression analysis","wetland areas","enormous impact","serious threat","need","regions","health of humans","residents","counties","Poyang Lake area","preventive measures","understanding","Emergence","Jiangxi Province","summary","results"],"language":"en"},

Four TaqMan(\u00AE) probes were synthesized, targeting at the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and coat protein (CP) genes of both viruses. The reporter dye FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) was used to label the 5\u2032 terminus of probes specific to CymMV, while TET (tetrachloro-6-carboxyfluorescein) was used for the ORSV probes. TAMRA (6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine), which was attached at the 3\u2032 terminus of each probe, was used as the universal quencher.

In this supplement, \u2018Diagnostic preparedness for WHO Blueprint pathogens\u2019, we describe specific diagnostic challenges presented by selected priority pathogens most likely to cause future epidemics. Some challenges to diagnostic preparedness are common to all outbreak situations, as highlighted by recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika and yellow fever. In this article, we review these overarching challenges and explore potential solutions. Challenges include fragmented and unreliable funding pathways, limited access to specimens and reagents, inadequate diagnostic testing capacity at both national and community levels of healthcare and lack of incentives for companies to develop and manufacture diagnostics for priority pathogens during non-outbreak periods. Addressing these challenges in an efficient and effective way will require multiple stakeholders\u2014public and private\u2014coordinated in implementing a holistic approach to diagnostics preparedness. All require strengthening of healthcare system diagnostic capacity (including surveillance and education of healthcare workers), establishment of sustainable financing and market strategies and integration of diagnostics with existing mechanisms. Identifying overlaps in diagnostic development needs across different priority pathogens would allow more timely and cost-effective use of resources than a pathogen by pathogen approach; target product profiles for diagnostics should be refined accordingly. We recommend the establishment of a global forum to bring together representatives from all key stakeholders required for the response to develop a coordinated implementation plan. In addition, we should explore if and how existing mechanisms to address challenges to the vaccines sector, such as Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, could be expanded to cover diagnostics.","publish_time":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelly-Cirino, Cassandra D; Nkengasong, John; Kettler, Hannah; Tongio, Isabelle; Gay-Andrieu, Fran\u00E7oise; Escadafal, Camille; Piot, Peter; Peeling, Rosanna W; Gadde, Renuka; Boehme, Catharina","journal":"BMJ Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e9667fc7fcb441ee60a45d5cc2a8550205c9ad3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6362765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30815287/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2018-001179","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Diagnostic preparedness","diagnostics preparedness","specific diagnostic challenges","integration of diagnostics","overarching challenges","manufacture diagnostics","healthcare system diagnostic capacity","diagnostic development needs","inadequate diagnostic testing capacity","different priority pathogens","selected priority pathogens","pathogen approach","outbreak situations","Epidemic Preparedness Innovations","existing mechanisms","community levels of healthcare","education of healthcare workers","non-outbreak periods","successful outbreak containment","multiple stakeholders","holistic approach","key stakeholders","establishment of sustainable financing","coordinated implementation plan","specimens","limited access","reagents","surveillance","unreliable funding pathways","market strategies","Coalition","target product profiles","effective way","Zika","recent outbreaks of Ebola","lack of incentives","response","cost-effective use of resources","companies","pathogens\u2019","representatives","Gavi","overlaps","vaccines sector","yellow fever","future epidemics","global forum","potential solutions","article","supplement","addition"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus can survive on surfaces for extended periods, sometimes up to months. Factors influencing the survival of these viruses on surfaces include: strain variation, titre, surface type, suspending medium, mode of deposition, temperature and relative humidity, and the method used to determine the viability of the virus. Environmental sampling has identified contamination in field-settings with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, although the frequent use of molecular detection methods may not necessarily represent the presence of viable virus. The importance of indirect contact transmission (involving contamination of inanimate surfaces) is uncertain compared with other transmission routes, principally direct contact transmission (independent of surface contamination), droplet, and airborne routes. However, influenza virus and SARS-CoV may be shed into the environment and be transferred from environmental surfaces to hands of patients and healthcare providers. Emerging data suggest that MERS-CoV also shares these properties. Once contaminated from the environment, hands can then initiate self-inoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes or mouth. Mathematical and animal models, and intervention studies suggest that contact transmission is the most important route in some scenarios. Infection prevention and control implications include the need for hand hygiene and personal protective equipment to minimize self-contamination and to protect against inoculation of mucosal surfaces and the respiratory tract, and enhanced surface cleaning and disinfection in healthcare settings.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Otter, J.

Also, polymorphisms in the IL-10, TNF\u03B1 and INF\u03B3 genes were associated with immune responsiveness and the frequency of complications. Here, the effect of these polymorphisms on illness and seroconversion during infection with rhinovirus type 39 (RV39) was evaluated. METHODS: Seventy-two adults were genotyped for the selected polymorphisms, experimentally exposed to RV39 and followed for infection, seroconversion and symptoms/signs of illness. Regression analysis was used to determine if these polymorphisms predicted seroconversion and illness magnitude in 57 infected subjects. RESULTS: The low production IL-6 (\u2212174, C/C) phenotype was associated with greater symptom magnitudes and the INF\u03B3 (\u002B874) phenotype predicted the frequency of seroconversion. No relationship between the IL-10 or TNF\u03B1 polymorphisms and any measured outcome was documented. IL-6 protein measured in nasal wash fluids of 51 subjects was positively correlated with symptom magnitude but was independent of the IL-6 (\u2212174) genotypes representing high and low production phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: These results document significant associations between the IL-6 (\u2212174) and INF\u03B3 (\u002B874) gene polymorphisms and specific responses to experimental RV39 infection. For the IL-6 (\u2212174) polymorphism, the results replicate those for RSV infection.","publish_time":"2010-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doyle, William J.; Casselbrant, Margaretha L.; Li-Korotky, Ha-Sheng; Cullen Doyle, Allison P.; Lo, Chia-Yee; Turner, Ronald; Cohen, Sheldon","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6a7d5bca74e1dc5c95ab2bea8f1e4c29d806ead.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2943745.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20001857/; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/201/2/199/18059941/201-2-199.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1086/649559","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TNF\u03B1 polymorphisms","low production IL","RSV infection","gene polymorphisms","selected polymorphisms","predicted illness magnitude","experimental RV39 infection","frequency of seroconversion","signs of illness","INF\u03B3 genes","adults","low production phenotypes","results document significant associations","infected subjects","frequency of complications","measured outcome","greater symptom magnitudes","specific responses","immune responsiveness","children","promoter","position","nasal wash fluids","rhinovirus type","CONCLUSIONS","genotypes","protein","symptoms","INTRODUCTION","effect","Regression analysis","METHODS","relationship"],"language":"en"},

The periods of respiratory shedding of BCV were determined by direct immunofluorescent (DIF) staining of nasal epithelial cells and ELISA of nasal swab supernatant fluids. The periods of fecal shedding of BCV were determined by ELISA and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). The isotype-specific antibody titers to BCV in serum (at selected intervals between 0 and 120 days of age) and the post-suckling (24 to 48 h after birth) total immunoglobulin levels were examined by ELISA and zinc sulfate turbidity tests, respectively. Of the 8 calves studied, 4 had evidence of BCV respiratory (by DIF or ELISA) or enteric infections (by IEM or ELISA) in association with diarrhea or rhinitis, even though 7 or 8 calves showed increases in one or more serum antibody isotypes to BCV and 6 of 8 calves showed BCV respiratory or enteric antigen shedding by ELISA. Serological antibody titer increases occurred in 3 calves before 30 days of age and in 4 calves after 30 days of age; two of the latter calves had a second rise in serum antibody titers to BCV after the initial rise. A serological antibody titer increase was not observed in one calf. This suggests that BCV infections may be very common in a closed herd and may occur in older calves, although many may be subclinical and some may be recurrent. There were no statistically significant correlations between total serum immunoglobulin levels or BCV antibody isotype titers in serum (24\u201348 h after birth) and clinical disease or infection by BCV; however, calves with low levels of IgA BCV antibodies in serum (24\u201348 h after birth) had a significantly greater average number of days with diarrhea than those calves having high levels of IgA BCV-specific antibodies in serum.","publish_time":"1990-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heckert, R.

A retrospective study, including segregation and pedigree analysis, was conducted to investigate potential cases of congenital vestibular disease (CVD) in captive Sumatran tigers in Australasian zoos using medical and husbandry records, as well as video footage obtained from 50 tigers between 1975 and 2013. Data from the GSMP Sumatran tiger studbook were made available for pedigree and segregation analysis. Fourteen cases of CVD in 13 Sumatran tiger cubs and one hybrid cub (Panthera tigris ssp. sumatrae \u00D7 Panthera tigris) were identified. Vestibular signs including head tilt, circling, ataxia, strabismus and nystagmus were observed between birth and 2 months of age. These clinical signs persisted for a median of 237 days and had resolved by 2 years of age in all cases. Pedigree analysis revealed that all affected tigers were closely related and shared a single common ancestor in the last four generations.

Many companies are involved with the COVID-19 outbreak because they are established in or work with China (client or supplier), and most have already activated their business continuity planning or equivalent. During an infectious disease outbreak like COVID-19, most large companies around the world have a major part to play, especially in terms of preparedness and emergency response. Indeed, companies should be integrated into the governmental health contingency plan developed in many countries, and by WHO and the International Labor Organization.

Such avoidance behaviors could greatly impact daily routines of the community and the local economy. This study examined the prevalence of the avoidance behaviors (i.e. avoiding going out, visiting crowded places and visiting hospitals) and negative psychological responses of the general population in Hong Kong at the initial stage of the H1N1 epidemic. METHODS: A sample of 999 respondents was recruited in a population-based survey. Using random telephone numbers, respondents completed a structured questionnaire by telephone interviews at the \u0027pre-community spread phase\u0027 of the H1N1 epidemic in Hong Kong. RESULTS: This study found that 76.5% of the respondents currently avoided going out or visiting crowded places or hospitals, whilst 15% felt much worried about contracting H1N1 and 6% showed signs of emotional distress. Females, older respondents, those having unconfirmed beliefs about modes of transmissions, and those feeling worried and emotionally distressed due to H1N1 outbreak were more likely than others to adopt some avoidance behaviors. Those who perceived high severity and susceptibility of getting H1N1 and doubted the adequacy of governmental preparedness were more likely than others to feel emotionally distressed. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of avoidance behaviors was very high. Cognitions, including unconfirmed beliefs about modes of transmission, perceived severity and susceptibility were associated with some of the avoidance behaviors and emotional distress variables. Public health education should therefore provide clear messages to rectify relevant perceptions.","publish_time":"2010-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Joseph TF; Griffiths, Sian; Choi, Kai Chow; Tsui, Hi Yi","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68aa709cc13d459268d903c0a505c56dda9bcc81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2891756.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20509887/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of avoidance behaviors","H1N1 epidemic","Hong Kong","H1N1 outbreak","general public","older respondents","general population","unconfirmed beliefs","hospitals","public areas","high severity","perceived severity","susceptibility","crowded places","study","Public health education","emotional distress variables","signs of emotional distress","telephone interviews","pre-community spread phase","modes of transmissions","random telephone numbers","population-based survey","negative psychological responses","clear messages","structured questionnaire","initial stage","daily routines","SARS pandemic","worry","adequacy of governmental preparedness","relevant perceptions","Cognitions","CONCLUSIONS","local economy","BACKGROUND","METHODS","sample","Females","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

RA is characterized by the clinical findings of synovial inflammation, autoantibody production, and cartilage/bone destruction, cardiovascular, pulmonary and skeletal disorders. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were responsible for the induction of inflammation in RA patients. Drawbacks such as poor efficacy, higher doses, frequent administration, low responsiveness, and higher cost and serious side effects were associated with the conventional dosage forms for RA treatment. Nanomedicines were recently gaining more interest towards the treatment of RA, and researchers were also focusing towards the development of various anti-inflammatory drug loaded nanoformulations with an aid to both actively/passively targeting the inflamed site to afford an effective treatment regimen for RA. Alterations in the surface area and nanoscale size of the nanoformulations elicit beneficial physical and chemical properties for better pharmacological activities. These drug loaded nanoformulations may enhances the solubility of poorly water soluble drugs, improves the bioavailability, affords targetability and may improve the therapeutic activity. In this regimen, the present review focus towards the novel nanoparticulate formulations (nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanomicelles, and nanocapsules) utilized for the treatment of RA. The recent advancements such as siRNA, peptide and targeted based nanoparticulate systems for RA treatment were also discussed.

Patients receiving RRT in the private sector are not included in this report. The number of patients receiving RRT was 6,054 (889 per million population [pmp]), of whom 51.6% (3,123, 451 pmp) were receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD), 10.9% (662, 97 pmp) hemodialysis (HD), and 37.5% (2,269, 334 pmp) had functioning kidney transplants. The net increase from the previous year in the number of patients receiving RRT was 3.1%. The incidence of end-stage renal failure in patients undergoing RRT was 954 (140 pmp). The median ages of existing and new patients receiving RRT were 55 and 56 years, respectively. There was a trend towards an increasing number of elderly dialysis patients. Diabetes was the third major cause of renal failure among existing RRT patients and the most common cause of renal failure in new cases. The rate of serologic positivity for hepatitis B infection in RRT patients was 9.68%, while that for hepatitis C infection was 3.28%. In Hong Kong, most patients were put on PD when RRT was required. Of all patients on dialysis, 83% were on PD, of whom 94.8% were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Most CAPD patients were on disconnect systems. HD was used in 17.5% of all patients on dialysis. Of the 2,269 patients with functioning kidney transplants, 836 (36.8%) were transplanted in Hong Kong. Of these, 495 (59.2%) had undergone cadaveric kidney transplantation. Of all patients receiving RRT, 30% were receiving erythropoietin. For the year ending 31 March 2004, the annual crude mortality rate for all RRT was 10% (15.3% for PD, 13% for HD, and 1.9% for transplantation). The major causes of death were infection, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular accident. The 1- and 5-year survival rates for patients with kidney transplantation performed in Hong Kong between 1 April 1997 and 31 March 2003 were 98.6% and 96.5%, respectively, for living related kidney transplants, and 96.1% and 91.2%, respectively, for cadaveric kidney transplants. The 1- and 5- year graft survival rates were 91.1% and 86.1% (death censored) and 90.5% and 85.6% (death not censored) for living related kidney transplants, and 89% and 83% (death censored) and 86% and 79% (death not censored) for cadaveric kidney transplants.

The significant value of community pharmacies was further highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. OBJECTIVE: The assessment of community pharmacies preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross\u2010sectional interview survey of 1018 community pharmacies working in four regions of Egypt (South, East, Centre, and North). Data collection was conducted from 8\u201319 April 2020. RESULTS: Availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medication was better than alcohol (70% conc.). Home delivery services were available in 49.1% of pharmacies. Infection control measures covering interactions between staff were in place in up to 99.5% of pharmacies. Conversely, there was less frequent availability of contactless payment (29.1%), hand sanitizers (62.1%) or masks (86.5%) for customer use, or a separate area for patients with suspected COVID-19 (64%). Verbal customer education (90.4%) was used preferably to written (81.3%). Despite high clinical knowledge and awareness (97.6%\u201399.2%), only 8.8% of pharmacists had reported suspected COVID-19 cases, however this varied significantly with pharmacist demographics (geographic region P \u003C 0.001; pandemic training p \u003C 0.001; position p = 0.019; age p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Government and policymakers strive to mitigate the shortage of PPE and medication. More attention should be given to infection control measures around interactions between staff and customers to ensure community pharmacists are fit and able to provide continuity in their important role. Educating customers using regularly-updated posters, banners or signs will contribute to decreasing contact with patients, and reducing the number and duration of visits to the pharmacy. Pandemic preparedness of community pharmacists must also extend to reporting procedures. By avoiding under-reporting or over-reporting, community pharmacists will contribute to accurate monitoring of the national spread of infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bahlol, Mohamed; Dewey, Rebecca Susan","journal":"Res Social Adm Pharm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93dbfad4baef53e70281d9a6489b37ffee7b4a3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211678.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417070/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.05.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551741120305015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551741120305015?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pandemic preparedness of community pharmacists","assessment of community pharmacies preparedness","significant value of community pharmacies","pandemic training p","suspected COVID","position p","age p","pandemic crisis","Infection control measures","staff","geographic region P","interactions","over-reporting","medication","customers","under-reporting","patients","national spread of infection","shortage of PPE","important role","initial contact","customer use","important healthcare service","Verbal customer education","Availability of personal protective equipment","frequent availability of contactless payment","separate area","accurate monitoring","East","regions of Egypt","cross\u2010sectional interview survey","Centre","South","signs","updated posters","RESULTS","pharmacist demographics","members","policymakers","duration of visits","high clinical knowledge","awareness","Home delivery services","banners","METHODS","number","continuity","OBJECTIVE","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","Government","hand sanitizers","pharmacy","masks","alcohol","place","attention","cases","Data collection","procedures"],"language":"en"},

This study evaluated the perceived effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs and knowledge transfer among primary care HCWs at a hospital in Saudi Arabia that witnessed the largest outbreak of confirmed MERS-CoV cases in this country. METHODS: A survey was distributed among primary care HCWs at five clinics in Saudi Arabia in 2016. Those with non-direct patient care responsibilities were excluded. Their knowledge was evaluated against facts published by Mayo Clinic Foundation, and its percentage mean score (PMS) \u00B1 standard deviation was calculated. HCWs\u2019 perceived effectiveness of educational programs and knowledge transfer was classified as negative or positive. RESULTS: Sample comprised of 404 HCWs, of which 64% were females and 36% were males. Almost 26% were \u2264 30 years old, and 42% had \u003E 10 years of work experience. Almost 46.5% were nurses, 23.0% physicians, 18.1% were pharmacists, and 12.4% were technical staff. PMS for knowledge was 71.1 \u00B1 19.4. The prevalence of negative perceptions towards educational programs was 22.5% and of knowledge transfer was 20.8%. Older(\u003E 40 years of age) and more experienced(\u003E 10 years) HCWs had the highest PMS for knowledge(73.4 \u00B1 18.9,P = 0.005 and 76.9 \u00B1 15.7,P \u003C 0.001 respectively). Negative perceptions of educational programs (49.4 \u00B1 20.7; P \u003C 0.001) and knowledge transfer (46.0 \u00B1 19.7; P = 0.001) were associated with a lower knowledge PMS. Males were 2.4[95% confidence interval 1.4\u20134.2] times and 2.0[1.1\u20133.5] times more likely to have negative perceptions of educational programs and knowledge transfer (adjusted (adj.)P = 0.001 and adj. P = 0.023, respectively). Physicians/pharmacists were 1.8[1.03\u20133.11] and 2.8[1.6\u20135.0] times more likely to have negative perceptions of both outcomes (adj. P = 0.038 and adj. P = 0.001, respectively). Less experienced HCWs were 2.1[1.3\u20133.5] times and 4.9[2.6\u20139.2] times more likely to exhibit negative perceptions of the two outcomes (adj. P \u003C 0.001 each). CONCLUSIONS: A negative perception of the effectiveness of MERS-CoV knowledge transfer was associated with poorer knowledge and was more prevalent among male HCWs, physicians/pharmacists and less experienced HCWs. Hospitals should always refer to efficient knowledge sharing and educational strategies that render beneficial outcomes to patients, HCWs, and the public community.

As a means of understanding the human infection, we characterized in vivo the neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties of HCoV-OC43 through the development of an experimental animal model. Virus inoculation of 21-day postnatal C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice led to a generalized infection of the whole CNS, demonstrating HCoV-OC43 neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence. This acute infection targeted neurons, which underwent vacuolation and degeneration while infected regions presented strong microglial reactivity and inflammatory reactions. Damage to the CNS was not immunologically mediated and microglial reactivity was instead a consequence of direct virus-mediated neuronal injury. Although this acute encephalitis appears generally similar to that induced by murine coronaviruses, an important difference rests in the prominent spongiform-like degeneration that could trigger neuropathology in surviving animals.","publish_time":"2003-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacomy, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Talbot, Pierre J","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87b6a8ab446e5be0bb9e07f85c43ce6c0203de3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126296.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203003234; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203003234","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human infection","human brain","Human respiratory coronaviruses","human neurodegenerative diseases","degeneration","HCoV-OC43 neuroinvasiveness","generalized infection","CNS","acute infection targeted neurons","strong microglial reactivity","neuroinvasive properties of HCoV","murine coronaviruses","neural cells","Virus inoculation","acute encephalitis","consequence of direct virus","myelin-reactive T cells","infected regions","important difference rests","vacuolation","underlying pathologic mechanisms","BALB","day postnatal C57BL","development","Abstract Involvement of viruses","c mice","inflammatory reactions","neuronal injury","experimental animal model","neuropathology","neurovirulence","surviving animals","means","Damage"],"language":"en"},

To explore the mechanistic basis of mucosal protective immunity, gene transcriptional profiling in mucosal tissues was evaluated after the primary and secondary immunization of animals with an attenuated avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a prototype of Coronavirus and a well-characterized mucosal pathogen. Results showed that a number of innate immune factors including toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic-acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-1), type I interferons (IFNs), complements, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03B2) were activated locally after the primary immunization. This was accompanied or immediately followed by a potent Th1 adaptive immunity as evidenced by the activation of T-cell signaling molecules, surface markers, and effector molecules. A strong humoral immune response as supported by the significantly up-regulated immunoglobulin (Ig) gamma chain was observed in the absence of innate, Th1 adaptive immunity, or IgA up-regulation after the secondary immunization, indicating that the local memory response is dominated by IgG.

However, their roles in the disease have not been determined. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of WUPyV and KIPyV in the Chinese population suffering from ARTIs in Beijing, China, and to examine their possible role in causing disease. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates, nasal swabs and throat swabs were collected from 415 children and 297 immunocompetent adults with lower ARTIs (LARTIs). The specimens were screened by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of WUPyV, KIPyV, and other common respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: Although none of the adults sampled were positive for either virus, WUPyV in 10 (2.4%) children and KIPyV was detected in 2 (0.5%) of the children sampled, respectively. Eleven of the positive cases were co-detected with either rhinovirus (6/11), respiratory syncytial virus (4/11), parainfluenzavirus virus (3/11) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae (2/11). Phylogenetic analysis of the WUPyV and KIPyV isolates showed that the nucleotide sequences were homologous to those of previously reported strains. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of WUPyV and KIPyV in samples from children but not from immunocompetent adults suffering from LARTIs suggests that these viruses primarily infect the young population. Co-detection of additional respiratory pathogens in most of the specimens containing either WUPyV or KIPyV suggests that these viruses do not cause disease independently.","publish_time":"2008-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Lili; Gonzalez, Richard; Xie, Zhengde; Zhang, Jing; Liu, Chunyan; Li, Jianguo; Li, Yongjun; Wang, Zhong; Kong, Xiaohui; Yao, Yuan; Hu, Yinghui; Qian, Suyun; Geng, Rong; Yang, Yan; Vernet, Guy; Paranhos-Baccal\u00E0, Gl\u00E1ucia; Jin, Qi; Shen, Kunling; Wang, Jianwei","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dce727e548ef89577ed105562b2036efb26c67b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172307.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653208002850; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2008.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18790667/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653208002850","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["children","presence of WUPyV","KIPyV isolates","termed WUPyV","prevalence of WUPyV","respiratory tract specimens","respiratory syncytial virus","disease","common respiratory pathogens","immunocompetent adults","acute respiratory tract infections","Co-detection of additional respiratory pathogens","lower ARTIs","parainfluenzavirus virus","LARTIs","nasal swabs","throat swabs","Chinese population","young population","positive cases","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","samples","STUDY DESIGN","polymerase chain reaction","new polyomaviruses","nucleotide sequences","Beijing","rhinovirus","Phylogenetic analysis","China","possible role","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","reported strains","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES","roles","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The detection limit of the one-step multiplex RT-PCR for GAR, GCR, BCV, and BToV was 10(2), 10(0), 10(1), and 10(2) TCID(50)/ml, respectively, and that for GBR was 10(6) copies/ml. The one-step multiplex RT-PCR with newly designed primers to detect GAR had higher sensitivity than a single RT-PCR with conventional primers, with no false-positive reactions observed for ten other kinds of bovine RNA viruses To assess its field applicability, 59 of 60 fecal samples containing one of these five viruses from all 25 epidemic diarrhea outbreaks in adult cattle were positive in the one-step multiplex RT-PCR assay.

However, there is no consensus on the definition and measurement of resilience in the context of physical disease. Objective The aim was to summarize the range of definitions of physical disease resilience and the approaches taken to study it in studies examining physical disease and its relationship to resilient outcomes. Methods Electronic databases were searched from inception to March 2013 for studies in which physical disease was assessed for its association with resilient outcomes. Article screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were carried out independently by 2 reviewers, with disagreements being resolved by a third reviewer. The results were combined using a narrative technique. Results Of 2280 articles, 12 met the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 1 was of high quality, 9 were of moderate quality, and 2 were low quality. The common findings were that resilience involves maintaining healthy levels of functioning following adversity and that it is a dynamic process not a personality trait. Studies either assessed resilience based on observed outcomes or via resilience measurement scales. They either considered physical disease as an adversity leading to resilience or as a variable modifying the relationship between adversity and resilience. Conclusion This work begins building consensus as to the approach to take when defining and measuring physical disease resilience. Resilience should be considered as a dynamic process that varies across the life-course and across different domains, therefore the choice of a resilience measure should reflect this.","publish_time":"2015-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnston, Marjorie C.; Porteous, Terry; Crilly, Michael A.; Burton, Christopher D.; Elliott, Alison; Iversen, Lisa; McArdle, Karen; Murray, Alison; Phillips, Louise H.; Black, Corri","journal":"Psychosomatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/348d4efec3935a438bce6e5f5ed986d5ee2d0810.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111641.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033318214001650; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2014.10.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25620566/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033318214001650","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["physical disease resilience research","measurement of resilience","context of physical disease","resilience measurement scales","burden of disease","studies","moderate quality","quality assessment","low quality","high quality","resilient outcomes","observed outcomes","relationship","approaches","dynamic process","consensus","results","Background Findings","common findings","healthy levels of functioning following adversity","data extraction","range of definitions","different domains","life-course","inception","choice","association","Article screening","Methods Electronic databases","articles","personality trait","variable","disagreements","inclusion criteria","aim","narrative technique","reviewers","Objective","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

As healthcare resources had to be preserved for infected patients, and the risk of in-hospital procedures escalated for uninfected patients and staff, neurosurgeons around the world have had to postpone non-emergent procedures. Under these unprecedented conditions, the decision to defer cases became increasingly difficult as COVID-19 cases skyrocketed. METHODS: Data was collected by self-reporting surveys during two discrete periods: the principal survey accrued responses during 2 weeks at the peak of the global pandemic, and the supplemental survey accrued responses after that to detect changes in opinions and circumstances. Nine hypothetical surgical scenarios were used to query neurosurgeons\u2019 opinion on the risk of postponement and the urgency to re-schedule the procedures. An acuity index was generated for each scenario, and this was used to rank the nine cases. RESULTS: There were 494 respondents to the principal survey from 60 countries. 258 (52.5%) reported that all elective cases and clinics have been shut down by their main hospital. A total of 226 respondents (46.1%) reported that their operative volume had dropped more than 50%. For the countries most affected by COVID-19, this proportion was 54.7%. There was a high degree of agreement among our respondents that fast-evolving neuro-oncological cases are non-emergent cases that nonetheless have the highest risk in postponement, and selected vascular cases may have high acuity as well. CONCLUSION: We report on the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgeons around the world. From their ranking of the nine case scenarios, we deduced a strategic scheme that can serve as a guideline to triage non-emergent neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic. With it, hopefully, neurosurgeons can continue to serve their patients without endangering them either neurologically or risking their exposure to the deadly virus.

Nevertheless, the precise role of E1 in viral entry remains elusive. METHODS: To understand the involvement of the fusion peptide-like domain positioned at residues 264 to 290 within envelope glycoprotein E1 in HCV infection, mutants with Ala and Asn substitutions for residues conserved between HCV and E proteins of flaviviruses or the fusion proteins of paramyxoviruses were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and their effects on membrane fusion and viral infectivity were examined. RESULTS: None of these mutations affected the synthesis or cell surface expression of envelope proteins, nor did they alter the formation of a non-covalent E1-E2 heterodimer or E2 binding to the large extracellular loop of CD81. The Cys residues located at positions 272 and 281 were unlikely involved in intra- or intermolecular disulfide bond formation. With the exception of the G267A mutant, which showed increased cell fusion, other mutants displayed reduced or marginally inhibited cell fusion capacities compared to the wild-type (WT) E1E2. The G267A mutant was also an exception in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/HCV E1E2 pseudotyping analyses, in that it showed higher one-cycle infectivity; all other mutants exhibited greatly or partially reduced viral entry versus the WT pseudotype. All but the G278A and D279N mutants showed a WT-like profile of E1E2 incorporation into HIV-1 particles. Since C272A, C281A, G282A, and G288A pseudotypes bound to Huh7 cells as effectively as did the WT pseudotype, the reduced infectivity of these pseudotypes was due to their ability to inhibit cell fusion. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that specific residues, but not the structure, of this fusion peptide-like domain are required for mediating cell fusion and viral entry.","publish_time":"2009-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hsiao-Fen; Huang, Chia-Hsuan; Ai, Li-Shuang; Chuang, Chin-Kai; Chen, Steve SL","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ea207323d2fedf5b4f5a4cbb8fd1acd100df8a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2759930.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19778418/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1423-0127-16-89","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased cell fusion","mediating cell fusion","fusion peptide","membrane fusion","inhibited cell fusion capacities","fusion proteins of paramyxoviruses","cell receptors","viral infectivity","reduced viral entry","reduced infectivity","WT pseudotype","cell surface expression of envelope proteins","envelope glycoprotein E1","glycoprotein E2","E2 binding","HCV infection","D279N mutants","specific residues","Cys residues","HCV E1E2 pseudotyping analyses","E proteins of flaviviruses","HIV","exception","domain","cycle infectivity","G267A mutant","RESULTS","non-covalent E1-E2 heterodimer","human immunodeficiency virus type","hepatitis C virus","precise role of E1","profile of E1E2 incorporation","wild-type","G288A pseudotypes","intermolecular disulfide bond formation","Ala","effects","Asn substitutions","synthesis","large extracellular loop of CD81","C281A","G282A","site","positions","mutagenesis","mutations","structure","Huh7 cells","particles","involvement","BACKGROUND","G278A","ability","C272A","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Vero cell, an African green monkey kidney cell line, was often used to isolate and propagate PEDV. Nonetheless, the target cells of PEDV in vivo are intestinal epithelial cells, during infection, intestinal epithelia would be damaged and resulted in digestive disorders. The immune functions of porcine epithelial cells and interactions with other immune cell populations display a number of differences compared to other species. Type I interferon (IFN) plays an important role in antiviral immune response. Limited reports showed that PEDV could inhibit type I interferon production. In this study, porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), the target cells of PEDV, were used as the infection model in vitro to identify the possible molecular mechanisms of PEDV-inhibition IFN-\u03B2 production. RESULTS: PEDV not only failed to induce IFN-\u03B2 expression, but also inhibited dsRNA-mediated IFN-\u03B2 production in IECs. As the key IFN-\u03B2 transcription factors, we found that dsRNA-induced activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) was inhibited after PEDV infection, but not nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03BAB). To identify the mechanism of PEDV intervention with dsRNA-mediated IFN-\u03B2 expression more accurately, the role of individual molecules of RIG-I signaling pathway were investigated. In the upstream of IRF-3, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-or inhibitor of \u03BAB kinase-\u03B5 (IKK\u03B5)-mediated IFN-\u03B2 production was not blocked by PEDV, while RIG-I-and its adapter molecule IFN-\u03B2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1)-mediated IFN-\u03B2 production were completely inhibited after PEDV infection. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data demonstrated for the first time that PEDV infection of its target cell line, IECs, inhibited dsRNA-mediated IFN-\u03B2 production by blocking the activation of IPS-1 in RIG-I-mediated pathway. Our studies offered new visions in understanding of the interaction between PEDV and host innate immune system.","publish_time":"2015-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Liyan; Ge, Xuying; Gao, Yu; Herrler, Georg; Ren, Yudong; Ren, Xiaofeng; Li, Guangxing","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/384cdcda67c8a385d6a571ba5f9fb09e16d130b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4539884.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0345-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26283628/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV infection","target cells of PEDV","inhibition IFN-\u03B2 production","inhibited dsRNA-mediated IFN-\u03B2 production","dsRNA-mediated IFN-\u03B2 expression","mechanism of PEDV intervention","key IFN-\u03B2 transcription factors","adapter molecule IFN-\u03B2 promoter stimulator","possible molecular mechanisms of PEDV","mediated pathway","interferon production","dsRNA-induced activation of IFN regulatory factor","immune functions of porcine epithelial cells","target cell line","immune cell populations","porcine small intestinal epithelial cells","IECs","Vero cell","infection model","immune system","lack of optimal porcine cell lines","study","antiviral immune response","activation of IPS","type","African green monkey kidney cell line","role of individual molecules of RIG","elucidation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","important role","inhibitor of \u03BAB kinase-\u03B5","NF-\u03BAB","upstream of IRF","nuclear factor-kappaB","TANK-binding kinase","interactions","IKK\u03B5","TBK1","understanding","progress","number of differences","new visions","pathogenesis","host","time","studies","BACKGROUND","Limited reports","data","digestive disorders","species","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We synthesize the literature on the use of appropriate initial antibiotic therapy (AIAT) and inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy (IIAT) in P. aeruginosa infections, and the literature on risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa among hospitalized adult patients in LATAM. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and LILAC were searched between 2000 and August 2019. Abstracts and full-text articles were screened in duplicate. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted when studies were sufficiently similar. RESULTS: The screening of 165 citations identified through literature search yielded 98 full-text articles that were retrieved and assessed for eligibility, and 19 articles conducted in Brazil (14 articles), Colombia (4 articles), and Cuba (1 article) met the inclusion criteria. Of 19 eligible articles, six articles (840 subjects) examined AIAT compared to IIAT in P. aeruginosa infections; 17 articles (3203 total subjects) examined risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa; and four articles evaluated both. Four of 19 articles were rated low risk of bias and the remaining were deemed unclear or high risk of bias. In meta-analysis, AIAT was associated with lower mortality for P. aeruginosa infections (unadjusted summary OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28\u20130.81; I(2) = 59%), compared to IIAT and the association with mortality persisted in subgroup meta-analysis by low risk of bias (3 articles; unadjusted summary OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28\u20130.81; I(2) = 0%). No meta-analysis was performed for studies evaluating risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa as they were not sufficiently similar. Significant risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa included: prior use of antibiotics (11 articles), stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) (3 articles), and comorbidity score (3 articles). Outcomes were graded to be of low strength of evidence owing to unclear or high risk of bias and imprecise estimates. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the association of AIAT with lower mortality and prior use of antibiotics significantly predicts acquiring resistant P. aeruginosa infections. This review reinforces the need for rigorous and structured antimicrobial stewardship programs in the LATAM region.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ponce de Leon, Alfredo; Merchant, Sanjay; Raman, Gowri; Avendano, Esther; Chan, Jeffrey; Tepichin Hernandez, Griselda; Sarpong, Eric","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b11181fed00265c0381c8f396f4951e21786405d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099820.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099820/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LATAM","IIAT","AIAT"],"locations":["Brazil","Colombia","Cuba"],"keyphrases":["text articles","eligible articles","aeruginosa infections","acquisition of resistant","low risk of bias","high risk of bias","Significant risk factors","Treatment of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection","association of AIAT","subgroup meta-analysis","IIAT","lower mortality","Random effects meta-analysis","prior use of antibiotics","use of appropriate initial antibiotic therapy","LATAM region","studies","unadjusted summary","literature search","inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy","low strength of evidence","total subjects","structured antimicrobial stewardship programs","challenge","remaining","need","hospitalized adult patients","EMBASE","Cochrane","citations","Latin American countries","ICU","BACKGROUND","imprecise estimates","intensive care unit","METHODS","MEDLINE","screening","study","Brazil","Colombia","comorbidity score","inclusion criteria","RESULTS","LILAC","review","CONCLUSION","Cuba","Abstracts","duplicate","Outcomes","eligibility"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Excess age-specific mortality during periods of influenza activity was evaluated in Israel during the period 1999\u20132006 for three death categories. For each respiratory year, the lowest monthly moving average for the mortality rate was subtracted from each month in the period of influenza activity. Average mortality rates in years with minimal influenza activity were deducted from corresponding months to exclude winter mortality unrelated to influenza. The sums of these results were used as estimates of excess mortality rates. RESULTS: Overall excess mortality rates ranged from 7.7 to 36.1 per 100,000 for all causes, and from 4.4 to 24.4 per 100,000 for respiratory and circulatory causes. Influenza was associated with an average of 869 (range 280\u20131,516) deaths annually from respiratory and circulatory diseases during seasons with significant influenza activity. About 90% of the influenza-associated mortality from respiratory and circulatory diseases was in the age group 65\u002B years and about 1% in the age group \u003C50 years. The age group \u003C50 years accounted for an annual average of seven deaths from respiratory and circulatory diseases. CONCLUSION: Annual mortality associated with seasonal influenza is highly variable. Under the age of 50 years, there is minimal seasonal influenza associated mortality. This information provides an important baseline for evaluating the severity of the A(H1N1) 2009 influenza pandemic, where persons under 50 years of age were often disproportionately represented.","publish_time":"2011-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linhart, Y.; Shohat, T.; Bromberg, M.; Mendelson, E.; Dictiar, R.; Green, M.

Because inflammation is usually associated with oxidative stress, we investigated the effect of ExoU on free radical production and antioxidant defense mechanisms during the course of P. aeruginosa infection. In an experimental model of acute pneumonia, ExoU accounted for increased lipid peroxidation in mice lungs as soon as 3 h after intratracheal instillation of PA103 P. aeruginosa strain. The contribution of airway cells to the generation of a redox imbalance was assessed by in vitro tests carried out with A549 airway epithelial cells. Cultures infected with the ExoU-producing PA103 P. aeruginosa strain produced significantly increased concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides, 8-isoprostane, reactive oxygen intermediates, peroxynitrite and nitric oxide (NO), when compared to cells infected with exoU-deficient mutants. Overproduction of NO by PA103-infected cells likely resulted from overexpression of both inducible and endothelial NO synthase isoforms. PA103 infection was also associated with a significantly increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), a major antioxidant compound.

The activities of public health are complex, performed by multiple professionals, and range from the innocuous to the intrusive. Ethical analyses in public health reflect some of this complexity and fragmentation, with no one approach able to capture the full range of ethical considerations raised by public health activities. There are however, good reasons why we should pursue such analyses. Providing a robust ethical framework for public health may promote the identity and function of public health, address some of the shortcomings of utilitarianism, and help to combat the threat that public health faces through lack of political will in many parts of the world. In this paper I argue that Alasdair MacIntyre\u2019s account of practices and virtues can make a valuable contribution to public health ethics. The first part of the paper argues that public health may properly be described as the type of practice that provides an arena for the exercise of virtues. This is followed by an analysis of the three virtues of honesty, courage and justice in public health practice. Using virtue theory captures morally important elements of public health and helps to maintain awareness of significant moral values in the practice of public health. Such awareness is crucial in maintaining and defending the integrity of public health.","publish_time":"2014-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rogers, Wendy A.","journal":"Monash Bioeth Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6bb6c1f6d9a9552ea25bc2120ee20e8be42f5a7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100121/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozk4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["public health practice","practice of public health","activities of public health","public health activities","public health faces","function of public health","public health ethics","integrity of public health","important elements of public health","health of populations","Ethical analyses","virtues of honesty","range of ethical considerations","exercise of virtues","type of practice","paper","robust ethical framework","awareness of significant moral values","courage","justice","lack of political","valuable contribution","Alasdair MacIntyre\u2019s account of practices","address","identity","multiple professionals","arena","threat","virtue theory","parts","role","complexity","shortcomings of utilitarianism","fragmentation","analysis","good reasons","world"],"language":"en"},

We examine the discourse of \u2018preparedness\u2019 within pandemic planning documents produced by the World Health Organization from 1999 to 2009. We present key findings on: the construction of the influenza virus in terms of its potential to transform and expand across corporeal and territorial boundaries; and the integration of pandemic preparedness into everyday practices. Our analysis illustrates how the discourse of preparedness links the justification for population-level preemptive approaches to discursive constructions of the virus.

Time is the most important factor in rapidly developing and epidemiologically dangerous diseases, such as influenza, Ebola and SARS. Chronic viral diseases such as HIV-1 or HCV are asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic and the therapeutic success mainly depends on early detection of the infective agent. Over the last years, aptamer technology has been used in a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic applications and, concretely, several strategies are currently being explored using aptamers against virus proteins. From a diagnostics point of view, aptamers are being designed as a bio-recognition element in diagnostic systems to detect viral proteins either in the blood (serum or plasma) or into infected cells. Another potential use of aptamers is for therapeutics of viral infections, interfering in the interaction between the virus and the host using aptamers targeting host-cell matrix receptors, or attacking the virus intracellularly, targeting proteins implicated in the viral replication cycle. In this paper, we review how aptamers working against viral proteins are discovered, with a focus on recent advances that improve the aptamers\u2019 properties as a real tool for viral infection detection and treatment.","publish_time":"2016-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonz\u00E1lez, V\u00EDctor M.; Mart\u00EDn, M.

The analysis of the MD trajectories (MDTs) remains, however, the greatest challenge and requires a great deal of insight, experience, and effort. Here, we introduce a new class of invariants for MDTs based on the spatial distribution of Mean-Energy values \u03BEk (L) on a 2D Euclidean space representation of the MDTs. The procedure forces one MD trajectory to fold into a 2D Cartesian coordinates system using a step-by-step procedure driven by simple rules. The \u03BEk (L) values are invariants of a Markov matrix (1 \u03A0), which describes the probabilities of transition between two states in the new 2D space; which is associated to a graph representation of MDTs similar to the lattice networks (LNs) of DNA and protein sequences. We also introduce a new algorithm to perform phylogenetic analysis of peptides based on MDTs instead of the sequence of the polypeptide. In a first experiment, we illustrate this algorithm for 35 peptides present on the Peptide Mass Fingerprint (PMF) of a new protein of Leishmania infantum studied in this work. We report, by the first time, 2D Electrophoresis isolation, MALDI TOF Mass Spectroscopy characterization, and MASCOT search results for this PMF. In a second experiment, we construct the LNs for 422 MDTs obtained in DNA\u2013Drug Docking simulations of the interaction of 57 anticancer furocoumarins with a DNA oligonucleotide. We calculated the respective \u03BEk (L) values for all these LNs and used them as inputs to train a new classifier with Accuracy=85.44% and 84.91% in training and validation respectively. The new model can be used as scoring function to guide DNA\u2013Drug Docking studies in drug design of new coumarins for PUVA therapy. The new phylogenetics analysis algorithms encode information different from sequence similarity and may be used to analyze MDTs obtained in Docking or modeling experiments for any classes of biopolymers. The work opens new perspective on the analysis and applications of MD in polymer sciences.","publish_time":"2009-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E9rez-Montoto, L\u00E1zaro Guillermo; Dea-Ayuela, Mar\u00EDa Auxiliadora; Prado-Prado, Francisco J.; Bolas-Fern\u00E1ndez, Francisco; Ubeira, Florencio M.; Gonz\u00E1lez-D\u00EDaz, Humberto","journal":"Polymer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1577fbdc56e73d9a509bf83ada71cae3c142ee3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111648.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032386109004340; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032386109004340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287404/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2009.05.055","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":["Molecular Dynamics","Peptide Mass Fingerprint","PMF","PUVA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new algorithm","new perspective","new classifier","new model","new class of invariants","new phylogenetics analysis algorithms","drug design of new coumarins","new protein of Leishmania infantum","D space","applications of MD","MD trajectory","LNs","MD trajectories","graph representation of MDTs similar","DNA oligonucleotide","protein dynamics","respective \u03BEk","Drug Docking studies","Drug Docking simulations","phylogenetic analysis of peptides","Energy values \u03BEk","D Euclidean space representation","D Electrophoresis isolation","PMF","protein sequences","D Cartesian coordinates system","step-by-step procedure","function of biomolecules","scoring function","biopolymers science","peptides present","classes of biopolymers","procedure forces","sequence similarity","respective complexes","Peptide Mass Fingerprint","advent of Molecular Dynamics","MALDI TOF Mass Spectroscopy characterization","information different","MASCOT search results","Karplus","spatial distribution of Mean","lattice networks","structure","study","modeling experiments","states","great deal of insight","anticancer furocoumarins","PUVA therapy","experience","computational technique","Markov matrix","polymer sciences","greatest challenge","interactions","simple rules","Abstract","probabilities of transition","time","inputs","effort","Accuracy","training","validation","polypeptide"],"language":"en"},

As at today the disease has evolved into a serious global emergency leading to its declaration as a pandemic recently. Body On the African continent, Nigeria is just experiencing the direct effects of this pandemic having recorded her index case in February, 2020 with an increasing number of cases by the day and current case fatality ratio of 0.03 as at 13 April, 2020. Although the recorded cases may albeit seem low, it has been forecasted that Africa will have a fair share of the worst effects of this disease by the end of the pandemic. Generally, African countries have fragile health systems and this remains a source of concern especially in the event of increased outbreaks. Nigeria\u0027s current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of already infected patients requiring admission into Intensive care units (ICUs) for Acute Respiratory Diseases (ARDs) and SARS COV-2 pnuemonia. This has grim implications for Nigeria especially as increased cases that may require critical care looms. The provision of quarantine or isolation facilities can also be a challenge in Africa and availability of rapid diagnostic kits for fast and reliable testing and diagnosis of the disease.

Furthermore, Pepscan of the two linear epitopes demonstrated that SS2 (748YSNIGVCK755) and SS6 (764LQDGQVKI771) are two core epitopes on S1D5 and S1D6, respectively, located on the S protein of PEDV.","publish_time":"2008-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Dongbo; Feng, Li; Shi, Hongyan; Chen, Jianfei; Cui, Xiaochen; Chen, Hongyan; Liu, Shengwang; Tong, Youen; Wang, Yunfeng; Tong, Guangzhi","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11cd312b7ce5fdfd0a8e2e30ca0ea01c33929708.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117171.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.02.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113508000989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18400422/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113508000989","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV S","MER","GST","PEDV"],"locations":["Escherichia"],"keyphrases":["S1D region of PEDV S protein","native S protein of PEDV","epitopes S1D5","linear epitopes","spike protein","core epitopes","map epitopes","S1D6","residues","Abstract S1D","MER nucleotides","McAbs","neutralizing epitope region","micropanned epitope regions","mini-GST fusion proteins","GST tag","overlapping mini-fragments","gene","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","ELISA","Escherichia coli BL21","748YSNIGVCK755","S1-phage library","specific monoclonal antibodies","SS6","764LQDGQVKI771","SS2","Western blotting","result","amino acids","antisera","Pepscan"],"language":"en"},

Interestingly, a novel homologue of angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme, termed angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has been identified as a receptor for SARS\u2010CoV. Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme and ACE2 share homology in their catalytic domain and provide different key functions in the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS). Angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, which is a key effector peptide of the system and exerts multiple biological functions, whereas ACE2 reduces angiotensin II levels. Importantly, our recent studies using ACE2 knockout mice have demonstrated that ACE2 protects murine lungs from ARDS. Furthermore, SARS\u2010CoV infections and the Spike protein of the SARS\u2010CoV reduce ACE2 expression. Notably, injection of SARS\u2010CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo, which can be attenuated by blocking the renin\u2013angiotensin pathway, suggesting that the activation of the pulmonary RAS influences the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and SARS.","publish_time":"2008-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imai, Yumiko; Kuba, Keiji; Penninger, Josef M.","journal":"Exp Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a446d1e64eb87d0f51310243a320fbf28bbbfb5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197898.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18448662/; https://doi.org/10.1113/expphysiol.2007.040048","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsxMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","ALI/ARDS","SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["angiotensin system","termed angiotensin","angiotensin pathway","injection of SARS","enzyme","novel homologue of angiotensin","CoV Spike","ACE2 expression","ACE2 knockout mice","CoV infections","ARDS","ACE2 share homology","severe acute respiratory syndrome","acute lung failure","severe form of acute lung injury","development of acute respiratory distress syndrome","renin","different key functions","Spike protein","pathogenesis of ALI","pulmonary RAS","multiple biological functions","key effector peptide","catalytic domain","recent studies","activation","coronavirus","murine lungs","deaths","months","world","China","receptor","levels"],"language":"en"},

Molecular imaging techniques such as 2-deoxy-2-((18)F)fluoro-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) would be an invaluable method of tracking disease in vivo, but this technique has not been reported in the literature. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish baseline imaging characteristics of PET/computed tomography (CT) with (18)F-FDG in the ferret model. Twelve healthy female ferrets were anesthetized and underwent combined PET/CT scanning. After the images were fused, volumes of interest (VOIs) were generated in the liver, heart, thymus, and bilateral lung fields. For each VOI, standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated. Additional comparisons were made between radiotracer uptake periods (60, 90, and \u003E90 minutes), intravenous and intraperitoneal injections of (18)F-FDG, and respiratory gated and ungated acquisitions. Pulmonary structures and the surrounding thoracic and upper abdominal anatomy were readily identified on the CT scans of all ferrets and were successfully fused with PET. VOIs were created in various tissues with the following SUV calculations: heart (maximum standardized uptake value [SUV(Max)] 8.60, mean standardized uptake value [SUV(Mean)] 5.42), thymus (SUV(Max) 3.86, SUV(Mean) 2.59), liver (SUV(Max) 1.37, SUV(Mean) 0.99), right lung (SUV(Max) 0.92, SUV(Mean) 0.56), and left lung (SUV(Max) 0.88, SUV(Mean) 0.51). Sixty- to 90-minute uptake periods were sufficient to separate tissues based on background SUV activity. No gross differences in image quality were seen between intraperitoneal and intravenous injections of (18)F-FDG. Respiratory gating also did not have a significant impact on image quality of lung parenchyma. The authors concluded that (18)F-FDG PET and CT imaging can be performed successfully in normal healthy ferrets with the parameters identified in this study. They obtained similar imaging features and uptake measurements with and without respiratory gating as well as with intraperitoneal and intravenous (18)F-FDG injections. (18)F-FDG PET and CT can be a valuable resource for the in vivo tracking of disease progression in future studies that employ the ferret model.","publish_time":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Albert; Zheng, Huaiyu; Kraenzle, Jennifer; Biller, Ashley; Vanover, Carol D.; Proctor, Mary; Sherwood, Leslie; Steffen, Marlene; Ng, Chin; Mollura, Daniel J.; Jonsson, Colleen B.","journal":"ILAR Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd4ab978f42e3bee67824dbbb9a81ac6afa2bffd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ilar.53.1.9; https://academic.oup.com/ilarjournal/article-pdf/53/1/E9/1855772/ilar-53-9.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23382267/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Max"],"organizations":["VOI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["F-FDG PET","F-FDG injections","Mean","following SUV calculations","background SUV activity","CT imaging","uptake measurements","standardized uptake values","maximum standardized uptake value","combined PET","radiotracer uptake periods","minute uptake periods","CT scanning","CT scans","intraperitoneal injections","ferret model","intravenous injections","baseline imaging characteristics of PET","right lung","left lung","Respiratory gating","image quality of lung parenchyma","heart","similar imaging features","thymus","Molecular imaging techniques","bilateral lung fields","domestic ferret","normal healthy ferrets","liver","healthy female ferrets","study","VOIs","tracking of disease progression","long-standing animal model","separate tissues","various tissues","computed tomography","invaluable method of tracking disease","positron emission tomography","evaluation","future studies","Mustela putorius furo","significant impact","upper abdominal anatomy","parameters","SUVs","valuable resource","glucose","Pulmonary structures","ungated acquisitions","Additional comparisons","treatment of human diseases","gross differences","fluoro-D","minutes","volumes","images","aim","authors","literature"],"language":"en"},

Methods The purpose of this review was to examine published literature regarding adherence rates among ED personnel to selected infection control practices, including hand hygiene (HH) and aseptic technique during the placement of central venous catheters and urinary catheters. We also reviewed studies reporting rates of ED equipment contamination. PubMed was searched for studies that included adherence rates among ED personnel to HH during routine patient care, aseptic technique during the placement of central venous catheters and urinary catheters, and rates of equipment contamination. Results In total, 853 studies was screened, and 589 abstracts were reviewed. The full texts of 36 papers were examined, and 23 articles were identified as meeting inclusion criteria. Eight studies used various scales to measure HH compliance, which ranged from 7.7% to 89.7%. Seven articles examined central venous catheters inserted in the ED or by emergency medicine residents.

Four SARS-CoV PLpro lead inhibitors were tested against MERS-CoV PLpro, none of which were effective against MERS-CoV PLpro. Structure and sequence alignments revealed that two residues, Y269 and Q270, responsible for inhibitor binding to SARS-CoV PLpro, were replaced by T274 and A275 in MERS-CoV PLpro, making critical binding interactions difficult to form for similar types of inhibitors. High-throughput screening (HTS) of 25 000 compounds against both PLpro enzymes identified a small fragment-like noncovalent dual inhibitor. Mode of inhibition studies by enzyme kinetics and competition surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses suggested that this compound acts as a competitive inhibitor with an IC(50) of 6 \u03BCM against MERS-CoV PLpro, indicating that it binds to the active site, whereas it acts as an allosteric inhibitor against SARS-CoV PLpro with an IC(50) of 11 \u03BCM. These results raised the possibility that inhibitor recognition specificity of MERS-CoV PLpro may differ from that of SARS-CoV PLpro.

ISG15 consists of two Ub-like domains and aids the immune system in neutralizing infections by numerous pathogens and plays an important role in defending cells against many viruses including influenza A. Recently, Ub was found to be a substrate for ISG15, which can be ISGylated on Lys29 and Lys48, while the former is more dominant. The discovery of such hybrid ISG15-Ub chains brought forward various fundamental questions regarding the nature and effect of this conjugation. To further investigate the role of hybrid ISG15-Ub chains, the pure homogeneous material of these chains is needed in workable quantities. By applying advanced chemical strategies for protein synthesis, we report the total chemical synthesis of a 231-residue ISG15-Lys29-Ub hybrid chain. During the synthesis we encountered insoluble peptide fragments, and therefore we developed a new reversible Acm based solubilizing tag to efficiently tackle this hurdle.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the patient hospital records was performed, and recording only those with a microbiological diagnosis of pertussis infection detected using polymerase chain reaction, from January 2008 to December 2016. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients were identified, of which 105 (95.4%) were less than 6 months old, and 59.1% were males. The annual incidence of hospital admissions was estimated between 13.7 and 425.0 cases per 100 000 infants \u003C12 months old, with 2 peaks in 2011 and 2015. Household members were the main potential sources of infection. Main clinical features were pertussis cough associated with signs of catarrh, cyanosis, and lymphocytosis. Complications occurred in 15.4% of the patients (mainly pneumonia), but the outcome was favourable in all the cases. A lower age and non-vaccination were associated with an increased risk of developing complications (p \u003C .05). Viral co-infection occurred in 31.6% of infants diagnosed with pertussis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pertussis has increased in the last years in Gran Canaria, with a lower development of complications and mortality rates compared with the previous period. Lower age and non-vaccination status are considered risk factors for developing complications. Vaccination in pregnant women will probably lead to a decline in the incidence in the future, especially in infants younger than 6 months.","publish_time":"2018-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iglesias, Laura; Casabella Pernas, Antonio; Hern\u00E1ndez Febles, Melisa; Colino Gil, Elena; Eisman Maraver, Alicia; Pena L\u00F3pez, Mar\u00EDa Jos\u00E9","journal":"An Pediatr (Engl Ed)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fefd23165952762091ea8fd1d55dbc53949058ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172513.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2341287918301364; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2341287918301364; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpede.2017.10.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337323/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Gran Canaria"],"keyphrases":["incidence of pertussis","pertussis cough","PATIENTS","microbiological diagnosis of pertussis infection","lower development of complications","clinical pattern of Bordetella pertussis infection","lower age","hospitalised infants","infants younger","increased risk of developing complications","months old","main potential sources of infection","non-vaccination status","Viral co-infection","paediatric hospital","Gran Canaria","annual incidence of hospital admissions","cases","Main clinical features","patient hospital records","whooping cough","risk factors","retrospective review","mortality rates","signs of catarrh","year-old","polymerase chain reaction","Household members","future","cyanosis","previous period","outcome","decline","METHODS","years","pregnant women","lymphocytosis","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","total","pneumonia","peaks","CONCLUSIONS","males"],"language":"en"},

We introduce \u2018EpiJSON\u2019, a new, flexible, and standards-compliant format for the interchange of epidemiological data using JavaScript Object Notation. This format is designed to enable the widest range of epidemiological data to be unambiguously held and transferred between people, software and institutions. In this paper, we provide a full description of the format and a discussion of the design decisions made. We introduce a schema enabling automatic checks of the validity of data stored as EpiJSON, which can serve as a basis for the development of additional tools. In addition, we also present the R package \u2018repijson\u2019 which provides conversion tools between this format, line-list data and pre-existing analysis tools. An example is given to illustrate how EpiJSON can be used to store line list data. EpiJSON, designed around modern standards for interchange of information on the internet, is simple to implement, read and check. As such, it provides an ideal new standard for epidemiological, and other, data transfer to the fast-growing open-source platform for the analysis of disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Finnie, Thomas J.R.; South, Andy; Bento, Ana; Sherrard-Smith, Ellie; Jombart, Thibaut","journal":"Epidemics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/141bb78c68caf0302c6f31eac91d1ff5197d5771.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104924.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436515000973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27266846/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2015.12.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1755436515000973","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Abstract Epidemiology","JavaScript Object Notation"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["data transfer","validity of data","interchange of epidemiological data","line-list data","line list data","expanding range of data","widest range of epidemiological data","divergent ways data","standards-compliant format","pre-existing analysis tools","conversion tools","analysis of disease outbreaks","development of additional tools","interchange of information","modern standards","ideal new standard","fast-growing open-source platform","types","JavaScript Object Notation","repijson","discussion","automatic checks","precise way","complex problem","R package","schema","internet","basis","description","design decisions","Abstract Epidemiology","people","software","institutions","discipline","need","paper","example","fidelity"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The Korea Histiocytosis Working Party retrospectively analyzed data on 251 pediatric patients diagnosed with HLH between 1996 and 2011. RESULTS: In the study cohort, 25 cases were categorized with familial HLH, 64 with presumed secondary HLH, and 162 with unspecified HLH. Of 217 evaluable patients, 91 (42%) had concomitant Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection. Of 238 evaluable patients, central nervous system (CNS) involvement, which was more frequent in the familial group, was evident in 81 cases (34%). Genetic tests revealed a predominant UNC13D mutation with a high incidence of two recurrent splicing mutations (c.118\u2010308C\u003ET and c.754\u20101G\u003EC). The 5\u2010yr overall survival rate was 68% (38% in the familial group and 81% in the presumed secondary group). The 5\u2010yr overall survival rate among 32 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 64%. In multivariate analysis, a younger age at diagnosis, severe transaminasemia, and a coagulation abnormality were independent prognostic factors for survival. Responses during initial treatments were also significant indicators of outcome. CONCLUSION: Our study showed the unique predominance of a UNC13D mutation and vulnerability to Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection in Korean children with HLH and emphasizes the prognostic significance of age, liver dysfunction, and treatment responses in this disease. A multicenter prospective trial that builds on the present results is warranted to identify subgroups of patients with a poor prognosis and identify optimal treatments.","publish_time":"2014-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koh, Kyung\u2010Nam; Im, Ho Joon; Chung, Nak\u2010Gyun; Cho, Bin; Kang, Hyoung Jin; Shin, Hee Young; Lyu, Chuhl Joo; Yoo, Keon Hee; Koo, Hong Hoe; Kim, Hee\u2010Jin; Baek, Hee Jo; Kook, Hoon; Yoon, Hoi Soo; Lim, Young Tak; Kim, Heung Sik; Ryu, Kyung Ha; Seo, Jong Jin","journal":"Eur J Haematol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17a557b768a7ef6b87bd8c87bbf7ce89d6fb96e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163615.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935083/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ejh.12399","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLH"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["pediatric HLH","familial HLH","unspecified HLH","evaluable patients","presumed secondary HLH","subgroups of patients","familial group","nationwide registry of pediatric patients","presumed secondary group","yr overall survival rate","Barr virus infection","treatment responses","cases","predominant UNC13D mutation","prognostic significance of age","younger age","treatment outcomes","genetic features","concomitant Epstein","Genetic tests","Korea Histiocytosis","initial treatments","optimal treatments","present results","study cohort","independent prognostic factors","high incidence","vulnerability","coagulation abnormality","hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","severe transaminasemia","central nervous system","liver dysfunction","Korean children","involvement","diagnosis","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","CNS","Party","unique predominance","poor prognosis","data","recurrent splicing mutations","significant indicators of outcome","multivariate analysis","multicenter prospective trial","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","disease"],"language":"en"},

While there is limited literature available on gene expression markers associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the transcriptomic picture associated with critical respiratory illness in this disease is not known at the present moment. FINDINGS: By using Agilent microarray chips, we have profiled gene expression signatures in the whole blood of 28 COPD patients hospitalized with different degrees of respiratory compromise.12 of them needed of admission to the ICU, whilst 16 were admitted to the Respiratory Medicine Service. GeneSpring GX 11.0 software was used for performing statistical comparisons of transcript levels between ICU and non-ICU patients. Ingenuity pathway analysis 8.5 (IPA) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were used to select, annotate and visualize genes by function and pathway (gene ontology). T-test showed evidence of 1501 genes differentially expressed between ICU and non-ICU patients. IPA and KEGG analysis of the most representative biological functions revealed that ICU patients had increased levels of neutrophil gene transcripts, being [cathepsin G (CTSG)], [elastase, neutrophil expressed (ELANE)], [proteinase 3 (PRTN3)], [myeloperoxidase (MPO)], [cathepsin D (CTSD)], [defensin, alpha 3, neutrophil-specific (DEFA3)], azurocidin 1 (AZU1)], and [bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI)] the most representative ones. Proteins codified by these genes form part of the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and are involved in both antimicrobial defence and tissue damage. This \u201Cneutrophil signature\u201D was paralleled by the necessity of advanced respiratory and vital support, and the presence of bacterial infection. CONCLUSION: Study of transcriptomic signatures in blood suggests an essential role of neutrophil proteases in COPD patients with critical respiratory illness. Measurement and modulation of the expression of these genes could present an option for clinical monitoring and treatment of severe COPD exacerbations.","publish_time":"2012-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almansa, Raquel; Socias, Lorenzo; Sanchez-Garcia, Monica; Mart\u00EDn-Loeches, Ignacio; del Olmo, Milagros; Andaluz-Ojeda, David; Bobillo, Felipe; Rico, Lucia; Herrero, Agueda; Roig, Vicente; San-Jose, C Alicia; Rosich, Sara; Barbado, Julia; Disdier, Carlos; de Lejarazu, Ra\u00FAl Ortiz; Gallegos, Maria C; Fernandez, Victoria; Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e1989bee9ae95c79dea0e12d9f455cb1d2b61d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3475085.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22852767/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-5-401","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","Respiratory Medicine Service","IPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD patients","non-ICU patients","gene expression markers","Gene expression profiling","profiled gene expression signatures","gene ontology","critical respiratory illness","neutrophil-specific","genes form","neutrophil signature","increased levels of neutrophil gene transcripts","necessity of advanced respiratory","Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes","Respiratory Medicine Service","essential role of neutrophil proteases","different degrees of respiratory compromise","peripheral blood","KEGG analysis","IPA","treatment of severe COPD exacerbations","Study of transcriptomic signatures","Ingenuity pathway analysis","transcriptomic picture","cathepsin G","cathepsin D","representative ones","present moment","representative biological functions","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease","statistical comparisons of transcript levels","clinical monitoring","GEP","vital support","biomarker discovery","Agilent microarray chips","cells","limited literature available","software","molecular pathogenesis of prevalent diseases","BPI","option","Genomes","BACKGROUND","azurophilic granules of neutrophils","antimicrobial defence","tissue damage","azurocidin","permeability","presence of bacterial infection","useful approach","FINDINGS","MPO","CTSD","CTSG","CONCLUSION","evidence","ELANE","elastase","defensin","DEFA3","modulation","T-test","PRTN3","myeloperoxidase","proteinase","AZU1","GeneSpring GX","Measurement","Proteins","admission"],"language":"en"},

However, dedicated recoding signals in the mRNA can reprogram the ribosome to read the message in alternative ways. This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of three types of recoding events: stop-codon readthrough, \u20131 ribosome frameshifting and translational bypassing.

In this study, we sequenced whole MERS-CoV genomes directly from respiratory samples collected from 23 confirmed MERS cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). These samples included cases from three nosocomial and three household clusters. The sequences were analysed for changes and relatedness with regard to the collected epidemiological data and other available MERS-CoV genomic data. Sequence analysis supports the epidemiological data within the clusters, and further, suggests that these clusters emerged independently. To understand how and when these clusters emerged, respiratory samples were taken from dromedary camels, a known host of MERS-CoV, in the same geographic regions as the human clusters. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes from six virus-positive animals were sequenced, and these genomes were nearly identical to those found in human patients from corresponding regions. These data demonstrate a genetic link for each of these clusters to a camel and support the hypothesis that human MERS-CoV diversity results from multiple zoonotic introductions.","publish_time":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paden, C.

Here, we investigated the CypA dependence of three distantly related nidoviruses that can all replicate in Huh7 cells: the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV), the alphacoronavirus human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and the betacoronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The replication of these viruses was compared in the same parental Huh7 cells and in CypA-knockout Huh7 cells generated using CRISPR/Cas9-technology. CypA depletion reduced EAV yields by ~ 3-log, whereas MERS-CoV progeny titers were modestly reduced (3-fold) and HCoV-229E replication was unchanged.

Host immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized2. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoV.","publish_time":"2020-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pfaender, Stephanie; Mar, Katrina B.; Michailidis, Eleftherios; Kratzel, Annika; Hirt, Dagny; V\u2019kovski, Philip; Fan, Wenchun; Ebert, Nadine; Stalder, Hanspeter; Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Hoffmann, Markus; Hoffmann, H.

METHODS: Cohort of 659 hospitalized children (2 months to 14 years) with SALRTI admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in the Guangzhou from May 2015 to April 2018 was enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens or induced sputum were tested for eight categories respiratory viral targets. The viral distribution and its clinical characters were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Viral pathogen was detected in 326 (49.5%) of children with SALRTI and there were 36 (5.5%) viral coinfections. Overall, the groups of viruses identified were, in descending order of prevalence: Influenza virus (IFV) (n = 94, 14.3%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 75, 11.4%), human rhinovirus (HRV) (n = 56, 8.5%), adenovirus (ADV) (n = 55, 8.3%), parainfluenza (PIV) (n = 47, 7.1%), human coronavirus (HCoV) (n = 15, 2.3%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (n = 14, 2.1%) and human bocavirus (HBoV) (n = 11, 1.7%).

In contrast, the epidemiology of \u03B4-CoVs in wild birds in the US is largely unknown. Our aim was to comparatively assess the prevalence of \u03B4- and \u03B3-CoVs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Wisconsin. A total of 1236 cloacal/fecal swabs collected during the period 2015\u20132018 were tested for \u03B3- and \u03B4-CoVs using genus-specific reverse transcription-PCR assays. A total of 61 (4.99%) samples were \u03B3-CoV positive, with up to 29 positive samples per state. In contrast, only 14 samples were positive for \u03B4-CoV (1.14%) with only 1\u20134 originating from the same state. Thus, unlike previous reports from Asia, \u03B3-CoVs are more prevalent than \u03B4-CoVs in the US, suggesting that \u03B4-CoVs may spread in birds with lower efficiency.

The pathogen is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer, causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but critical illness, bilateral viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a minority. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary public healthcare intervention used. The pace of transmission and global scale of SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control. This article presents a summary of learning points in epidemiological infection control from the SARS epidemic, alongside a review of evidence connecting current understanding of the virologic and environmental contamination properties of SARS-CoV-2. We present suggestions for how personal protective equipment policies relate to the viral pandemic context and how the risk of transmission by and to anaesthetists, intensivists, and other healthcare workers can be minimised.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Odor, Peter M.; Neun, Maximilian; Bampoe, Sohail; Clark, Sam; Heaton, Daniel; Hoogenboom, Emilie M.; Brown, Michael; Patel, Anil; Kamming, Damon","journal":"Br J Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86c58960f3733a069909fe40cb2c20301e5f794b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7142687.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007091220302002?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0007091220302002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32307115/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","spread of SARS","SARS epidemic","human transmission","global scale of SARS","environmental contamination properties of SARS","epidemiological infection control","risk of transmission","pace of transmission","healthcare workers","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","acute respiratory distress syndrome","viral pandemic context","unprecedented healthcare crisis","pandemic novel beta coronavirus","primary public healthcare intervention","bilateral viral pneumonia","summary of learning points","virologic","contact transfer","resource management","personal protective equipment policies","critical illness","implications","majority of cases","mild symptoms","strategic oversight","current understanding","droplets exposure","review of evidence","responsiveness","ARDS","infections","present suggestions","intensivists","anaesthetists","article","world","minority","pathogen"],"language":"en"},

However, there is still no effective therapeutic treatment for NAFLD. Here, we showed that remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), as a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug with anti-inflammatory effects, was effective for attenuating HFD-induced metabolic disorder and insulin resistance. Results revealed that the liver weight, hepatic dysfunction and lipid accumulation were markedly increased compared with that of the Control group, while that of the RDV group exhibited significant reduction, accompanied by the improved signaling pathway regulating fatty acid metabolism. In agreement with reduced lipid deposition, RDV supplementation suppressed the systematic and hepatic inflammation, as evidenced by reduction of inflammatory cytokines and the blockage of nuclear factor \u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) signaling. In addition, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and its down-streaming factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) were greatly increased in livers of HFD-fed mice, which were considerably restrained by RDV treatment. The in vitro analysis suggested that RDV functioned as an inhibitor of STING, contributing to the suppression of dyslipidemia and inflammation induced by palmitate (PA). However, PA-triggered lipid deposition and inflammatory response was further accelerated in hepatocytes with STING over-expression. Notably, RDV-attenuated lipid disorder and inflammation were significantly abrogated by the over-expression of STING in PA-stimulated hepatocytes. Taken together, these findings indicated that RDV exhibited protective effects against NAFLD development mainly through repressing STING signaling, and thus could be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy.","publish_time":"2020-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yan-Ni; Su, Ya","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a149e019907b2cc4b74b48dcdb55c5c60e10e168.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194706.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X20305131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32223926/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X20305131","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAFLD","RDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RDV group","RDV treatment","RDV supplementation","RDV-attenuated lipid disorder","hepatic inflammation","repressing STING","STING over-expression","over-expression of STING","inhibitor of STING","predisposing factor","lipid accumulation","PA-triggered lipid deposition","streaming factor interferon regulatory factor","reduced lipid deposition","blockage of nuclear factor \u03BAB","metabolic disorder","attenuating HFD","NAFLD development","livers of HFD","PA-stimulated hepatocytes","effective therapeutic treatment","metabolic syndrome-related systemic inflammation","reduction of inflammatory cytokines","anti-inflammatory effects","protective effects","non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","liver weight","inflammatory response","hepatic dysfunction","NF-\u03BAB","significant reduction","Control group","fatty acid metabolism","stimulator of interferon genes","potential therapeutic strategy","broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug","IRF3","Abstract High-fat diet","pathway","agreement","insulin resistance","addition","suppression of dyslipidemia","palmitate","findings","Results","mice","remdesivir","analysis"],"language":"en"},

We enumerate European surveillance systems and agencies which relate to port health security; we consider consortia and academic arrangements within the EU framework and established collaboration with the World Health Organization. We describe current Health Services Executive port health structures in Ireland which address preparedness and management of human health threats at points of entry. We appraise risks which Brexit could bring, reviewing literature on shared concerns about these risks, and we evaluate post-Brexit challenges for the EU, and potential opportunities to remain within current structures in shared health threat preparedness and response. It is imperative that the UK, Ireland and the EU work together to mitigate these risks using some agreed joint coordination mechanisms for a robust, harmonised approach to global public health threats at points of entry.","publish_time":"2019-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boland, M\u00E1ir\u00EDn; O\u2019Riordan, Mary","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1aadb0d868db77c282d5ce3f8f85508f8dabc4a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6724249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31481126/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-019-0496-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EU","World Health Organization"],"locations":["European Union","United Kingdom","Ireland"],"keyphrases":["management of human health threats","port health security","global public health threats","management of serious human health threats","serious threats","current Health Services Executive port health structures","World Health Organization","EU legislation","shared health threat preparedness","EU framework","risks","EU work","serious cross border threats","Ireland","current structures","European Parliament","European Union","relevant European Decision","points of entry","current situation","European surveillance systems","UK","infectious disease outbreaks","spread of infectious disease","post-Brexit challenges","established collaboration","established infections","biological agents","radiological agents","paper reviews international legislation","Irish borders","shared concerns","repeal of Decision","Co-ordinated international efforts","harmonised approach","emerging diseases","Council","processes","agencies","consortia","agreed joint coordination mechanisms","national transposition","academic arrangements","detection","potential opportunities","respect","literature","response","citizens","United Kingdom"],"language":"en"},

However, the success of this strategy requires the prompt onset of therapy within 48 hours of the appearance of clinical symptoms. This requirement may be captured by a compartmental model that monitors the density of infected individuals in terms of the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms. We show that such a model can be expressed by a system of delay differential equations with both discrete and distributed delays. The model is analyzed to derive the criterion for disease control based on two critical factors: (i) the profile of treatment rate; and (ii) the level of treatment as a function of time lag in commencing therapy. Numerical results are also obtained to illustrate the feasible region of disease control. Our findings show that due to uncertainty in the attack rate of a pandemic strain, initiating therapy immediately upon diagnosis can significantly increase the likelihood of disease control and substantially reduce the required community-level of treatment. This suggests that reliable diagnostic methods for influenza cases should be rapidly implemented within an antiviral treatment strategy.","publish_time":"2007-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alexander, Murray E.; Moghadas, Seyed M.; R\u00F6st, Gergely; Wu, Jianhong","journal":"Bull Math Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03c9c4d06fe6dab0aeb8c53321bfd755bb42c4a8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088798/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzEwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral treatment strategy","level of treatment","likelihood of disease control","profile of treatment rate","initiating therapy","commencing therapy","prompt onset of therapy","feasible region of disease control","onset of symptoms","compartmental model","new influenza pandemic strain","influenza cases","primary public health strategy","attack rate","function of time lag","required community-level","appearance of clinical symptoms","use of antiviral drugs","severity","hours","system of delay differential equations","density of infected individuals","reliable diagnostic methods","terms","diagnosis","distributed delays","critical factors","uncertainty","criterion","success","Numerical results","findings","requirement"],"language":"en"},

These statutes, despite their frequency, are misguided in terms of the goals of the criminal law and the public health aim of reducing overall burdens of disease, for at least three important reasons. First, they identify individual offenders for punishment, a paradigm that is misplaced in the most typical contexts of transmission of infectious disease and even for HIV/AIDS, despite claims of AIDS exceptionalism. Second, although there are examples of individuals who transmit infectious disease in a manner that fits the criminal law paradigm of identification of individual offenders for deterrence or retribution, these examples are limited and can be accommodated by existing criminal laws not devoted specifically to infectious disease. Third, and most importantly, the current criminal laws regarding HIV/AIDS, like many other criminal laws applied to infectious disease transmission, have been misguided in focusing on punishment of the diseased individual as a wrongful transmitter. Instead of individual offenders, activities that enhance the scale of disease transmission\u2014behaviors that might be characterized as \u2018transmission facilitation\u2019\u2014are a more appropriate target for the criminal law. Examples are trafficking in human beings (including sex trafficking, organ trafficking, and labor trafficking), suppression of information about the emergence of infection in circumstances in which there is a legally established obligation to disclose, and intentional or reckless activities to discourage disease treatment or prevention. Difficulties remain with justifications for criminalizing even these behaviors, however, most importantly the need for trust in reducing overall burdens of disease, problems in identifying individual responsible offenders, and potential misalignment between static criminal law and the changing nature of infectious disease.","publish_time":"2011-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Francis, Leslie Pickering; Francis, John G.","journal":"Crim Law Philos","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d3514cd54dde8a09b365fa5640d81485b8f376a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088803.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088803/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzEwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious disease transmission","victims of infectious disease","disease treatment","scale of disease transmission","static criminal law","overall burdens of disease","individual offenders","changing nature of infectious disease","criminal law paradigm of identification","current criminal laws","existing criminal laws","transmission of HIV","individual responsible offenders","diseased individual","transmission facilitation","labor trafficking","organ trafficking","sex trafficking","examples of individuals","typical contexts of transmission","claims of AIDS exceptionalism","punishment","behaviors","Statutes","reckless activities","potential misalignment","public health aim","problems","use","deterrence","manner","suppression of information","human beings","trust","retribution","emergence of infection","appropriate target","need","wrongful transmitter","terms","prevention","goals","circumstances","established obligation","justifications","frequency","important reasons","Difficulties"],"language":"en"},

When developing the equation of the CEAI, these six component indicators were weighted in accordance with the order of importance reported by the earlier studies. To test its validity, the CEAI was applied to the CPE status in three regions of Ghana. The results of this application revealed that there was greater discrepancies in the CEAI values according to the type of health facilities. The type of health facilities with the greatest CEAI (= 0.609) implying the best access to CPE was clinics while training/research institutes resulted in the lowest CEAI (= 0.447). Regional variation among the three regions was not significant. A simple linear regression between CEAI and adjusted number of CPE opportunities per health worker produced an extremely high conformity in the model (R (2) = 0.960). This may indicate the validity of the proposed CEAI model to the large extent.","publish_time":"2006-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aiga, Hirotsugu","journal":"Soc Indic Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d5be42c287d769444e4a6f801e41f9eb6f5b57bc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089030/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzEzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEAI","CPE"],"locations":["Ghana"],"keyphrases":["CEAI values","greatest CEAI","lowest CEAI","proposed CEAI model","CPE status","geographical access","availability of CPE","distribution of CPE","levels of access","informational access","economic access","best access","professional education access index","type of health facilities","health workers","adjusted number of CPE opportunities","validity","regions of Ghana","component indicators","clinics","research institutes","high conformity","training","simple linear regression","accordance","greater discrepancies","large extent","order of importance","application","earlier studies","Regional variation","preparedness","staff","results","equation"],"language":"en"},

The gene expression profiles of CDllb\u002B/Ly6Cintermcdiate macrophages of the sham surgery mice, and the mice 4 h, 24 h and 9 days after renal IRI were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Analysis of mRNA expression profiles was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), biological processes and pathways by the series test of cluster. Protein-protein interaction network was constructed and analysed to discover the key genes. A total of 6738 DEGs were identified and assigned to 20 model profiles. DEGs in profile 13 were one of the predominant expression profiles, which are involved in immune cell chemotaxis and proliferation. Signet analysis showed that Atp5al, Atp5o, Cox4i, Cdc42, Rac2 and Nhp2 were the key genes involved in oxidation-reduction, apoptosis, migration, M1-M2 differentiation, and proliferation of macrophages. RPS18 may be an appreciate reference gene as it was stable in macrophages. The identified DEGs and their enriched pathways investigate factors that may participate in the functional changes of CD 1lb(\u002B)Ly6C(intermediate) macrophages after renal IRI.

One of the most common ways of reinforcing anti-viral barriers is the horizontal transfer of viral genes into the host genome.

Thirty-five patients enrolled in this multi-institutional phase I/II trial received up to eight arterial infusions of up to 2 \u00D7 10(12) viral particles. Hepatic toxicity was the primary dose-limiting toxicity observed in preclinical models. However, nearly 200 infusions of this adenoviral vector were administered directly into the hepatic artery without significant toxicity. Therefore, we undertook this analysis to determine the impact of repeated adenoviral exposure on hepatic function. Seventeen patients were treated at our institution, providing a detailed data set on the changes in hepatic function following repeated exposure to adenovirus. No changes in hepatic function occurred with the first treatment of Onyx-015 among these patients. Transient increases in transaminase levels occurred in one patient starting with the second infusion and transient increases in bilirubin was observed in two patients starting with the fifth treatment. These changes occurred too early to be explained by viral-mediated lysis of hepatocytes. In addition, viremia was observed starting 3\u20135 days after the viral infusion in half of the patient, but was not associated with hepatic toxicity. To further understand the basis for the minimal hepatic toxicity of adenoviral vectors, we evaluated the replication of adenovirus in primary hepatocytes and tumor cells in culture and the expression of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) in normal liver and colon cancer metastatic to the liver. We found that adenovirus replicates poorly in primary hepatocytes but replicates efficiently in tumors including tumors derived from hepatocytes. In addition, we found that CAR is localized at junctions between hepatocytes and is inaccessible to hepatic blood flow. CAR is not expressed on tumor vasculature but is expressed on tumor cells. Spatial restriction of CAR to the intercellular space in normal liver and diminished replication of adenovirus in hepatocytes may explain the minimal toxicity observed following repeated hepatic artery infusions with Onyx-015.","publish_time":"2006-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Au, T; Thorne, S; Korn, W M; Sze, D; Kirn, D; Reid, T R","journal":"Cancer Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d7a77ac2dd86e85883ca2e28569cfeb6e772f68.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091580.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091580/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzMwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hepatic function","hepatic artery of patients","minimal hepatic toxicity of adenoviral vectors","repeated hepatic artery infusions","primary hepatocytes","hepatic blood flow","minimal toxicity","significant toxicity","normal liver","adenovirus replicates","changes","impact of repeated adenoviral exposure","viral-mediated lysis of hepatocytes","repeated exposure","tumor cells","viral infusion","treatment of Onyx","diminished replication of adenovirus","coxsackie-adenoviral receptor","primary dose","tumor vasculature","Spatial restriction of CAR","Transient increases","tumors","arterial infusions","viral particles","addition","colon cancer metastatic","metastatic colorectal cancer","intercellular space","expression","culture","trial","detailed data set","multi-institutional phase","transaminase levels","half","bilirubin","days","junctions","basis","preclinical models","analysis","viremia"],"language":"en"},

Adenoviruses frequently cause upper respiratory tract infections in humans and anti-adenoviral antibodies are found in 35\u201370% of the population. Therefore in the majority of potential patients receiving adenoviral gene therapy, the contact of virus particles and blood will lead to the formation of antigen\u2013antibody complexes. These complexes have the ability to induce inflammatory reactions via an activation of the complement system. We have determined the level of C3a (the most reactive complement component) generated in isolated citrate plasma of healthy individuals after challenge with recombinant and wild-type adenoviruses in amounts corresponding to virus blood levels to be expected in patients during adenoviral gene therapy. All plasma samples containing anti-adenoviral antibodies showed a substantial, dose-dependent generation of C3a. A virus plasma level of about 7.5 \u00D7 10(9) particles/ml (which was calculated to be the highest blood level reached during clinical trials in the past) induced an average release of about 3000 ng/ml C3a (baseline levels \u003C140 ng/ml). Analyzing the nature of anti-adenoviral antibodies showed, that not only antibodies with neutralizing properties (anti-Ad5), but also non-neutralizing anti-adenoviral antibodies are capable of complement activation. This study suggests that complement activation can be ignored in local low-dose applications of recombinant adenoviruses, but warrants attention after systemic application of large viral quantities. In clinical protocols aiming at systemic virus application, measures for monitoring and controlling the complement system should be included on a regular basis.","publish_time":"2002-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cichon, G; Boeckh-Herwig, S; Schmidt, HH; Wehnes, E; M\u00FCller, T; Pring-Akerblom, P; Burger, R","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b87db078a2c0381f7abbe7b1ced316a86ae4efa8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091591.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091591/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzMwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nature of anti-adenoviral antibodies","adenoviral gene therapy","complement system","non-neutralizing anti-adenoviral antibodies","virus plasma level","anti-Ad5","virus blood levels","capable of complement activation","level of C3a","systemic virus application","contact of virus particles","reactive complement component","highest blood level","wild-type adenoviruses","local low-dose applications of recombinant adenoviruses","plasma samples","dose-dependent generation of C3a","important vector system","clinical trials","neutralizing properties","clinical protocols","baseline levels","antibody complexes","isolated citrate plasma of healthy individuals","systemic application of large viral quantities","majority of potential patients","challenge","humans","upper respiratory tract infections","attention","amounts","monitoring","measures","past","inflammatory reactions","formation of antigen","ability","average release","regular basis","study","population"],"language":"en"},

Intradermal injection saw modified adenovirus being mainly processed in local draining lymph nodes and skin. Following intranasal administration (i.n.), neither unmodified nor targeted viruses were found to be in the liver or spleen, which predominantly took up the virus following i.v. administration. However, inadvertent infection of the brain was found with unmodified adenoviruses, with the second highest gene expression among 14 tissues examined. Importantly, such undesirable effects were largely ablated with the use of targeted vector. Moreover, the targeted adenovirus elicited more sustained antigen-specific cellular immune responses (up to 17-fold) at later time points (30 days post boosting), but also significantly hampered humoral responses irrespective of administration routes. Additional data suggest the skewed immune responses induced by the targeted adenoviruses were not due to the identity of the transgene but more likely a combination of overall transgene load and CD40 stimulation.

Controversy exists about whether the use of CD34(\u002B) enriched stem cells leads to a delayed haematological and immune reconstitution. We compared these parameters, including risk of infections and clinical outcome after HDT, in patients with HD given either selected CD34(\u002B) cells or unmanipulated PBPC as stem cell support. From October 1994 to May 2000, 40 HD patients with primary refractory disease or relapse were treated with HDT and supported with either selected CD34(\u002B) cells (n = 21) or unmanipulated PBPC (n = 19) as stem cell support.

Clinical features of autosomal recessive ARS deficiencies appear very diverse and without apparent logic. We searched for common clinical patterns to improve disease recognition, insight into pathophysiology, and clinical care. METHODS: Symptoms were analyzed in all patients with recessive ARS deficiencies reported in literature, supplemented with unreported patients evaluated in our hospital. RESULTS: In literature, we identified 107 patients with AARS, DARS, GARS, HARS, IARS, KARS, LARS, MARS, RARS, SARS, VARS, YARS, and QARS deficiencies. Common symptoms (defined as present in \u22654/13 ARS deficiencies) included abnormalities of the central nervous system and/or senses (13/13), failure to thrive, gastrointestinal symptoms, dysmaturity, liver disease, and facial dysmorphisms. Deep phenotyping of 5 additional patients with unreported compound heterozygous pathogenic variations in IARS, LARS, KARS, and QARS extended the common phenotype with lung disease, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and renal tubulopathy. CONCLUSION: We propose a common clinical phenotype for recessive ARS deficiencies, resulting from insufficient aminoacylation activity to meet translational demand in specific organs or periods of life. Assuming residual ARS activity, adequate protein/amino acid supply seems essential instead of the traditional replacement of protein by glucose in patients with metabolic diseases.","publish_time":"2018-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fuchs, Sabine A.; Schene, Imre F.; Kok, Gautam; Jansen, Jurriaan M.; Nikkels, Peter G.

Adenoviral (Ad) vectors, although highly efficient in liver gene transfer, have proven to be limited for pulmonary gene transfer with respect to efficiency, in part because of difficulty in assuring significant residence time in the lung and/or paucity of receptors for adenovirus on the endothelium. A recent study has shown that the use of a bispecific antibody to endothelial cells and Ad vectors efficiently redirects Ad vectors to pulmonary endothelium and improves gene expression in the lung. In this study, we report that pulmonary gene transfer by Ad vectors can also be improved significantly via the use of cationic liposomes. Preinjection of cationic liposomes followed by adenovirus led to a significant increase in the level of gene expression in the lung. The improvement in pulmonary gene transfer was associated with a decrease in the level of gene expression in the liver. Gene expression in the lung lasted for up to 2 weeks. This protocol, together with genetic modification of adenovirus, may prove to be useful for pulmonary gene transfer for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. This method may also be extended to pulmonary gene transfer using other types of viral vectors via vascular route.","publish_time":"2002-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Z; Mi, Z; Wilson, A; Alber, S; Robbins, PD; Watkins, S; Pitt, B; Li, S","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acc885026bd5ad3d8f01b72e3bdf510d80857c35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091708.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091708/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzMzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary gene transfer","pulmonary endothelium","liver gene transfer","Somatic gene transfer","level of gene expression","Ad vectors","primary pulmonary hypertension","pulmonary metastatic disease","treatment of pulmonary diseases","lung","phenotype of endothelium","types of viral vectors","use of cationic liposomes","genetic modification of adenovirus","Preinjection of cationic liposomes","vascular route","significant increase","useful strategy","recent study","vascular smooth muscle","significant residence time","disorders","endothelial cells","ARDS","bispecific antibody","efficiency","decrease","difficulty","respect","paucity of receptors","improvement","protocol","weeks","method"],"language":"en"},

Elucidating the consequences of this endoproteolytic cleavage is crucial for our understanding of cell death and other biological processes. Many caspase substrates are just cleaved as bystanders, because they happen to contain a caspase cleavage site in their sequence. Several targets, however, have a discrete function in propagation of the cell death process. Many structural and regulatory proteins are inactivated by caspases, while other substrates can be activated. In most cases, the consequences of this gain-of-function are poorly understood. Caspase substrates can regulate the key morphological changes in apoptosis. Several caspase substrates also act as transducers and amplifiers that determine the apoptotic threshold and cell fate. This review summarizes the known caspase substrates comprising a bewildering list of more than 280 different proteins. We highlight some recent aspects inferred by the cleavage of certain proteins in apoptosis. We also discuss emerging themes of caspase cleavage in other forms of cell death and, in particular, in apparently unrelated processes, such as cell cycle regulation and cellular differentiation.","publish_time":"2003-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fischer, U; J\u00E4nicke, R U; Schulze-Osthoff, K","journal":"Cell Death Differ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/faa7376827b940434c797c4559223d4002c0683f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091709.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzMzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["caspase cleavage site","known caspase substrates","Apoptotic cell death","understanding of cell death","forms of cell death","cell death process","cell fate","emerging themes of caspase cleavage","cleavage of certain proteins","caspase-mediated cleavage of various vital proteins","endoproteolytic cleavage","cell cycle regulation","regulatory proteins","different proteins","apoptosis","consequences","unrelated processes","biological processes","apoptotic threshold","discrete function","bewildering list","propagation","key morphological changes","cellular differentiation","amplifiers","transducers","gain","caspases","review","recent aspects","cases","bystanders","targets"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: SARS coronavirus (CoV)F69 (AY313906) and Z2-Y3 (AY394989) were isolated and identified from 2 different Cantonese onset SARS patients. Immunogen was prepared from SARS-CoV F69 strain. Six health horses were immunized 4 times and serum was collected periodically to measure the profile of specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a microneutralization test. Sera were collected in large amounts at the peak, where IgG was precipitated using ammonium sulphate and subsequently digested with pepsin. The product was then purified using anion-exchange chromatography to obtain F(ab\u2032)(2) fragments. RESULTS: The specific IgG and neutralizing antibody titers peaked at approximately week 7 after the first immunization, with a maximum value of 1:14210. The sera collected at the peak were then purified. Fragment of approximately 15 g F(ab\u2032)(2) was obtained from 1 litre antiserum and the purity was above 90% with the titer of 1:5120, which could neutralize the other strain (SARS-CoV Z2-Y3) as well.

Between May 2009 and May 2010, all allo-HSCTs who presented with respiratory symptoms were screened for the presence of the H1N1 virus. Oseltamivir resistance was assessed and chart reviews were performed for all cases. In all, 51 of 248 (20%) allo-HSCT recipients followed at our outpatient clinic were screened. We identified 10 patients with H1N1 infection. Close contact with children was the most commonly suspected mode of transmission. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were present in eight and five patients, respectively. Lymphopenia (\u003C1 G/L) was the most frequent biological abnormality. High immunosuppression was responsible for severe infection requiring mechanical ventilation associated with prolonged viral shedding in three patients who had significant comorbidities and GvHD. Two of them developed an oseltamivir-resistant strain and both patients died subsequently despite intensive therapy, resulting in a case fatality rate of 20%. In conclusion, although most allo-HSCTs had mild symptoms from H1N1 infection, severe immunosuppression and emergence of oseltamivir resistance were likely responsible for a substantial morbidity, further supporting the need for vaccination and monitoring of close contacts, especially children.","publish_time":"2011-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohty, B; Thomas, Y; Vukicevic, M; Nagy, M; Levrat, E; Bernimoulin, M; Kaiser, L; Roosnek, E; Passweg, J; Chalandon, Y","journal":"Bone Marrow Transplant","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/395ae288d1c5c5e4213e56c592ee31f5b104765a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091841.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091841/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzM4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1 infection","patients","H1N1-Influenza","H1N1 virus","allo-HSCTs","allo-HSCT recipients","severe infection","severe immunosuppression","emergence of oseltamivir resistance","respiratory symptoms","children","oseltamivir-resistant strain","mild symptoms","High immunosuppression","monitoring of close contacts","allogeneic hematopoietic SCT recipients","lower respiratory tract infections","mechanical ventilation","pandemic","prolonged viral shedding","need","substantial morbidity","vaccination","chart reviews","presence","intensive therapy","significant comorbidities","case fatality rate","GvHD","outpatient clinic","suspected mode of transmission","frequent biological abnormality","cases","impact","conclusion","Lymphopenia"],"language":"en"},

Each year, influenza has spread around the world causing about 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths and more than 5 million cases of severe illness. The objective is as follows: evaluating the outcomes of patients with influenza A (H1N1) virus in relation to certain TNF-308, IL6, and IL8 polymorphisms and identifying the associated factors with the severe outcome. SUBJECT AND METHODS: This is a case\u2013control study. The cases were patients confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to be influenza A (H1N1) virus infected. The controls were healthy individuals. Medical history and outcome of the disease was registered. In all study participants, polymorphisms of TNF rs1800629, IL6 rs18138879, and IL8 rs4073; odds ratio (OR); and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Infection with influenza A (H1N1) virus was associated more with the following genotypes: TNF-308 AA (OR = 4.041; 95% CI = 1.215\u201313.4) and IL8 AA (OR = 3.273; 95% CI = 1.372\u20137.805).

The suddenness of this mandate and the concomitant spread of the COVID-19 virus left many hospital systems, orthopaedic practices, and patients with notable anxiety and confusion as to the near, intermediate, and long-term future of our healthcare system. As with most businesses in the United States during this time, many orthopaedic practices have been emotionally and fiscally devastated because of this crisis. Furthermore, this pandemic is occurring at a time where small and midsized orthopaedic groups are already struggling to cover practice overhead and to maintain autonomy from larger health systems. It is anticipated that many groups will experience financial demise, leading to substantial global consolidation. Because the authors represent some of the larger musculoskeletal multispecialty groups in the country, we are uniquely positioned to provide a framework with recommendations to best weather the ensuing months. We think these recommendations will allow providers and their staff to return to an infrastructure that can adjust immediately to the pent-up healthcare demand that may occur after the COVID-19 pandemic. In this editorial, we address practice finances, staffing, telehealth, operational plans after the crisis, and ethical considerations.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vaccaro, Alexander R.; Getz, Charles L.; Cohen, Bruce E.; Cole, Brian J.; Donnally, Chester J.","journal":"J Am Acad Orthop Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce8fd28a875f7ad5c28f4b8ccea6c5ca83b3ea2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197337.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5435/jaaos-d-20-00379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["orthopaedic practices","midsized orthopaedic groups","time","United States","recommendations","COVID","country","crisis","pandemic","larger musculoskeletal multispecialty groups","larger health systems","hospital systems","practice finances","healthcare system","pent-up healthcare demand","telehealth","patients","confusion","long-term future","best weather","operational plans","staffing","notable anxiety","widespread cessation","virus","financial demise","concomitant spread","ensuing months","elective surgery","autonomy","substantial global consolidation","mandate","framework","Surgeon General","ethical considerations","suddenness","providers","editorial","authors","businesses","infrastructure"],"language":"en"},

Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. METHODS: In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. FINDINGS: From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36\u201366 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3\u20136 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6\u201310 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged \u003E60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients\u0027 RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. INTERPRETATION: Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

Previously we developed a large variety of benzimidazole derivatives able to inhibit these viruses. Herein, two series of (thio)semicarbazone- and hydrazone-based benzimidazoles have been explored, by derivatizing 5-acetyl benzimidazoles previously reported by us, thereby evaluating the influence of the modification on the antiviral activity. Compounds 6, 8, 16 and 17, bearing the 5-(thio)semicarbazone and 5-hydrazone functionalities in combination with the 2-benzyl ring on the benzimidazole core structure, acted as dual inhibitors of influenza A virus and human coronavirus. For respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), activity is limited to the 5-thiosemicarbazone (25) and 5-hydrazone (22) compounds carrying the 2-[(benzotriazol-1/2-yl)methyl]benzimidazole scaffold. These molecules proved to be the most effective antiviral agents, able to reach the potency profile of the licensed drug ribavirin. The molecular docking analysis explained the SAR of these compounds around their binding mode to the target RSV F protein, revealing the key contacts for further assessment.

These preparations do not typically include planning for complete border closure. Even though border closure may not be instituted in time, and can fail, there might still plausible chances of success for well organized island nations. OBJECTIVE: To estimate costs and benefits of complete border closure in response to new pandemic threats, at an initial proof-of-concept level. New Zealand was used as a case-study for an island country. METHODS: An Excel spreadsheet model was developed to estimate costs and benefits. Case-study specific epidemiological data was sourced from past influenza pandemics. Country-specific healthcare cost data, valuation of life, and lost tourism revenue were imputed (with lost trade also in scenario analyses). RESULTS: For a new pandemic equivalent to the 1918 influenza pandemic (albeit with half the mortality rate, \u201CScenario A\u201D), it was estimated that successful border closure for 26 weeks provided a net societal benefit (e.g., of NZ$11.0 billion, USD$7.3 billion). Even in the face of a complete end to trade, a net benefit was estimated for scenarios where the mortality rate was high (e.g., at 10 times the mortality impact of \u201CScenario A\u201D, or 2.75% of the country\u2019s population dying) giving a net benefit of NZ$54 billion (USD$36 billion). But for some other pandemic scenarios where trade ceased, border closure resulted in a net negative societal value (e.g., for \u201CScenario A\u201D times three for 26 weeks of border closure\u2013but not for only 12 weeks of closure when it would still be beneficial). CONCLUSIONS: This \u201Cproof-of-concept\u201D work indicates that more detailed cost-benefit analysis of border closure in very severe pandemic situations for some island nations is probably warranted, as this course of action might sometimes be worthwhile from a societal perspective.","publish_time":"2017-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boyd, Matt; Baker, Michael G.; Mansoor, Osman D.; Kvizhinadze, Giorgi; Wilson, Nick","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32e54e86db8e7cc46844319fb3dba6d9a02a86f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5473559.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28622344/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178732","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["weeks of border closure","weeks of closure","successful border closure","pandemic influenza","benefits of complete border closure","pandemic scenarios","detailed cost-benefit analysis of border closure","new pandemic threats","new pandemic equivalent","net societal benefit","net benefit of NZ","severe pandemic situations","future pandemic risks","lost trade","island country","mortality rate","scenario analyses","net negative societal value","complete end","costs","organized island nations","New Zealand","times","societal perspective","mortality impact","USD","Country-specific healthcare cost data","Case-study specific epidemiological data","past influenza pandemics","initial proof","concept level","lost tourism revenue","valuation of life","response","novel emerging agents","synthetic bioweapons","plausible chances of success","work","planning","Excel spreadsheet model","METHODS","face","RESULTS","country\u2019s population","course of action","OBJECTIVE","BACKGROUND","Countries","preparations","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Objectives To determine the etiology of bronchiolitis in northern Portugal. Study design It was a prospective multicenter study on the etiology of bronchiolitis during the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season (November\u2013April). Children \u226424 months of age admitted for a first wheezing episode were included. Nasopharyngeal specimens were analyzed by an indirect immunofluorescent-antibody assay (IFA) for RSV, adenovirus (HAdV), parainfluenza (PIV) 1\u20133 and influenza (IV) A and B and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR for the same viruses and for human metapneumovirus (hMPV), bocavirus (HBoV), rhinovirus (HRV), coronaviruses (229/E; NL63; OC43; HKU1) and enterovirus. Results During this period, 253 children were included, 249 IFA analyses and 207 PCRs were performed. IFA detected RSV in 58.1%; PCR increased it to 66.7%. IFA detected HAdV in 3.2%, PCR 10.0%. PCR detected IV A in 5; IV B in 2; PIV 1 in 6, PIV 2 in 4 and PIV 3 in 11 cases. HBoV, as single agent in 2 cases, and HRV were positive in 8 samples and hMPV in 11. With this virus panel, 19.7% remained without etiology. Conclusions The most frequent agent was RSV, followed by HAdV. PCR can be cost-effective and more accurate than IFA, which is crucial for HAdV that may be associated with significant mortality (IFA alone did not detect 2/3 of the cases).","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antunes, H.; Rodrigues, H.; Silva, N.; Ferreira, C.; Carvalho, F.; Ramalho, H.; Gon\u00E7alves, A.; Branca, F.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d36997029849bc7100a0c9bc5bf96f2bf87c5ce3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108435.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.03.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20362492/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210000983; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210000983","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IV"],"organizations":["IFA","PCR","PIV"],"locations":["Portugal"],"keyphrases":["RSV","HAdV","PIV","IFA analyses","etiology of bronchiolitis","cases","reverse transcription-PCR","hMPV","HRV","northern Portugal","Children","HBoV","Study design","frequent agent","single agent","virus panel","prospective multicenter study","respiratory syncytial virus","adenovirus nosocomial infections","closure","indirect immunofluorescent-antibody assay","bocavirus","polymerase chain reaction","OC43","HKU1","NL63","coronaviruses","human metapneumovirus","rhinovirus","pediatric department","season","months of age","samples","Conclusions","parainfluenza","Nasopharyngeal specimens","significant mortality","wheezing episode","enterovirus","Results","period","Abstract Background","PCRs","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Design The new COVID-19 \u201Cmodule\u201D pharmaceutical care model was equipped with new features such as pharmacy emergency command group, organizational structure for pharmacy administration, electronic control of drug prescription, and \u201Czero contact\u201D pharmaceutical care relying on the new media platform \u201CWeChat\u201D. This platform provided relevant pharmaceutical care for patients, such as ensuring drug supply, setting up critical care drug trolleys, designing specific drug packaging bags, creating a module radio station to broadcast rational drug use information to the patients, and other aspects. Setting and participants The study was performed in Jianghan module hospital constructed at the Wuhan Convention and Exhibition Center in Wuhan, China. This is one of the first three module hospitals. Outcome measures Pharmacists successfully completed the tasks of purchase, storage, and free distribution of 1033844.3 RMB worth of drugs (about $146,000 US dollars), reviewed about 20,000 electronic orders, provided one-on-one online medication consultation for 484 patients, and held five lectures on rational drug use knowledge, which could help reduce irrational drug use and minimize the risk involved. Results The pharmacists provided pharmaceutical care for 1848 patients with mild COVID-19 disease. They not only ensured the timely supply of the drugs but also reduced the incidence of drug-induced risks through medication review and guidance, thereby improving patient compliance and helping the patients rebuild their confidence in overcoming the disease. Conclusion The new COVID-19 \u201Cmodule\u201D pharmaceutical care model has played an important role in overcoming the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in China and thus can be implemented on a broader scale.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hua, XiaoLi; Gu, Ming; Zeng, Fang; Hu, Huiping; Zhou, Tao; Zhang, Yu; Shi, Chen","journal":"J Am Pharm Assoc (2003)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57b66d63ee77a153144a4ea606239fa9a4f3ce9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146685.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1544319120301539; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544319120301539?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336673/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2020.04.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Jianghan","China"],"keyphrases":["drug supply","patients","pharmaceutical care model","relevant pharmaceutical care","incidence of drug","new COVID","critical care drug trolleys","irrational drug use","rational drug use knowledge","rational drug use information","module hospitals","electronic control of drug prescription","Jianghan module hospital","epidemic situation of COVID","mild COVID","specific drug packaging bags","module radio station","pharmacy administration","new features","new media platform","foreign pharmacists","epidemic prevention","China","disease","Outcome measures Pharmacists","pharmacy emergency command group","Wuhan Convention","electronic orders","medication review","timely supply","RMB worth of drugs","one-on-one online medication consultation","organizational structure","guidance","induced risks","free distribution","important role","tasks of purchase","Exhibition Center","reference","lectures","storage","study","contact","patient compliance","US dollars","Abstract Objective","WeChat","participants","confidence","Conclusion","broader scale","aspects"],"language":"en"},

The tetranortriterpenoid 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM), obtained from MA purification, displays anti-herpetic activity and impedes nuclear factor \u03BAB (NF-\u03BAB) activation in HSV-1 infected conjunctival cells. To extend our understanding about CDM biological properties, we investigated its anti-HSV-1 activity as well as the effect on NF-\u03BAB activation and cytokine secretion induced by viral (HSV-1) and no-viral (LPS) stimuli, in corneal cells and macrophages. CDM exerted a potent anti-HSV-1 effect on corneal cells and inhibited NF-\u03BAB translocation to the nucleus, leading to a decrease in IL-6 production. Besides, CDM seemed to modulate IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1 responses in macrophages, whether they were infected with HSV-1 or stimulated with LPS. However, CDM did not affect NF-\u03BAB activation in these cells, suggesting that an alternative NF-\u03BAB cell signaling pathway would be involved in the modulation of cytokine production. We conclude that, in addition to its antiviral effect, CDM would be acting as an immunomodulating compound which would be responsible for the improvement of murine HSK already reported.","publish_time":"2009-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bueno, Carlos A.; Barquero, Andrea A.; Di C\u00F3nsoli, Hern\u00E1n; Maier, Marta S.; Alch\u00E9, Laura E.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a166cd00e5f345628b409d989af5efdeb4a35d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114431.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170208004504; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2008.12.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19162100/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170208004504","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Meliacine"],"organizations":["CDM","HSK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NF-\u03BAB activation","inhibited NF-\u03BAB translocation","alternative NF-\u03BAB cell","corneal cells","potent anti-HSV","nuclear factor \u03BAB","CDM biological properties","antiviral effect","anti-herpetic activity","infected conjunctival cells","viral load","macrophages","IL","LPS","modulation of cytokine production","MA purification","cytokine secretion","antiviral principle present","improvement of murine HSK","development of herpetic stromal keratitis","virus-induced immunopathological reaction","purified leaf extracts of Melia azedarach","mice","pathway","stimuli","severity of lesions","eye","nucleus","TNF-\u03B1 responses","decrease","cinnamoyl","understanding","addition","immunomodulating compound","Abstract Meliacine","dihydroxymeliacarpin","tetranortriterpenoid"],"language":"en"},

Study design Polymerase chain reaction assays previously described were used to examine the presence of KIV and WUV in 2866 respiratory specimens collected from January to December 2003 from Australian patients with acute respiratory infections. Results KIV and WUV were present in our population with an annual prevalence of 2.6% and 4.5%, respectively. There was no apparent seasonal variation for KIV, but a predominance of infection was detected during late winter to early summer for WUV. The level of co-infection of KIV or WUV with other respiratory viruses was 74.7% and 79.7%, respectively. Both viruses were absent from urine and blood specimens collected from a variety of patient sources. Conclusions KIV and WUV circulate annually in the Australian population. Although there is a strong association with the respiratory tract, more comprehensive studies are required to prove these viruses are agents causing respiratory disease.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bialasiewicz, S.; Whiley, D.

METHODS We designed a prospective multicenter cohort study of pregnant women with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who were admitted to 12 Italian maternity hospitals between February 23 and March 28, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory and radiologic examinations, and pregnancy outcomes were collected. A subgroup of patients with severe disease was identified based on intensive care unit (ICU) admission, delivery for respiratory compromise, or both. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients were included, 14 of whom had severe disease (18%). Two thirds of the patients in the cohort were admitted during the third trimester, and 84% were symptomatic on admission. Eleven patients underwent urgent delivery for respiratory compromise (16%), and six were admitted to the ICU (8%). One woman received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; no deaths occurred. Preterm delivery occurred in 12% of patients, and nine newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Patients in the severe subgroup had significantly higher pregestational body mass indexes (BMIs) and heart and respiratory rates and a greater frequency of fever or dyspnea on admission compared with women with a nonsevere disease evolution. CONCLUSION In our cohort, one in five women hospitalized with COVID-19 infection delivered urgently for respiratory compromise or were admitted to the ICU. None, however, died.

We reviewed the data of all allogeneic HSCT recipients referred to our pulmonary department for a non-infectious bronchial disease between 1999 and 2010. We identified 103 patients (BOS (n=77), asthma (n=11) and chronic bronchitis (n=15)). In patients with BOS, we identified two functional phenotypes: a typical OLD, that is, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio \u003C0.7 (n=53), and an atypical OLD with a concomitant decrease in the FEV1 \u003C80% and FVC \u003C80% predicted with a normal total lung capacity (n=24). The typical OLD was characterized by more severe FEV1 and fewer centrilobular nodules on the computed tomography scan. The FEV1 was not significantly affected during the follow-up, regardless of the phenotype. In addition to acute and extensive chronic GVHD, only the occurrence of BOS soon after transplantation and the intentional treatment of BOS with steroids were associated with a poor survival.

Summary Dementias, and Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD) in particular, will increasingly become a public health issue. However, three major data may change the severity of these pathologies: in young adults, simple measures of healthy lifestyle (control of vascular risk factors, physical activity and cognitive stimulation), have an impact on a future cognitive decline; the same lifestyle interventions may delay the start of the disease for elderly people potentially at-risk; finally, and for the first time, a monoclonal antibody directed against amyloid lesions has just shown a significant effect on the progression of AD in patients at an early stage of the disease. According to these results, we will have to reconsider the strategy for managing minor or severe cognitive disorders and particularly AD. Nowadays, patients start the care process too late. The solution is to act earlier, even preventively.

Associated with repeated respiratory infections, the disease often results in hospital admission, impaired quality of life, reduced lung function and shortened life expectancy. We describe the local clinical, physiological and sputum characteristics in patients hospitalized with an infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis. METHODS: This study examined the medical records of all 61 adults admitted to a metropolitan Australian hospital with an infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis in a calendar year. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics include: mean (SD) age of participants was 66 (14) years; 56% were women and 42% were current or ex\u2010smokers. The majority had other coexisting medical conditions, with asthma in 44%, COPD in 59% and both asthma and COPD in 31%. Seventy\u2010two percent were on regular inhaled medication, 23% on cyclical antibiotics and 26% undertook regular respiratory physiotherapy. Bronchodilator reversibility was present in 17% and small airway reversibility in 41%. Sputum demonstrated normal flora in 17%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 32%, Haemophilus influenzae in 15% and both organisms in 17%. Mean numbers of exacerbations per year requiring hospitalization was 2.3. Sixty\u2010two percent of subjects had an Index of Relative Socio\u2010Economic Disadvantage in deciles 1\u20135. Risk factors for exacerbations included a history of asthma or COPD, documented small airway reversibility and presence of P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Patients hospitalized with an infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis are predominantly older with co\u2010morbidities and of lower socio\u2010economic status. Presence of P. aeruginosa was a risk factor for repeated exacerbations, as was a history of asthma, COPD or small airway reversibility.","publish_time":"2017-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Venning, Victoria; Bartlett, James; Jayaram, Lata","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ae82d5520c47167731f4266cdd770868c5602e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169079.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.13005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28236369/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australasia"],"keyphrases":["COPD","infective exacerbation of bronchiectasis","small airway reversibility","history of asthma","repeated exacerbations","Bronchodilator reversibility","sputum characteristics","patients","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Mean numbers of exacerbations","presence of","RESULTS","repeated respiratory infections","regular respiratory physiotherapy","hospital admission","Baseline characteristics","medical records","Risk factors","calendar year","percent of subjects","impaired quality of life","shortened life expectancy","metropolitan Australian hospital","lower socio\u2010economic status","regular inhaled medication","coexisting medical conditions","Index of Relative Socio\u2010Economic Disadvantage","reduced lung function","co\u2010morbidities","adults","disease","growing health burden","SD","deciles","cyclical antibiotics","OBJECTIVE","normal flora","study","majority","Haemophilus influenzae","hospitalization","age of participants","ex\u2010smokers","women","years","Australasia","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","organisms"],"language":"en"},

The small CoV envelope (E) protein plays roles in assembly, virion release, and pathogenesis. CoV E has a single hydrophobic domain (HD), is targeted to Golgi membranes, and has cation channel activity in vitro. The E protein from avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has dramatic effects on the secretory system, which require residues in the HD. Mutation of the HD of IBV E in a recombinant virus background results in impaired growth kinetics, impaired release of infectious virions, accumulation of IBV spike (S) protein on the plasma membrane compared to wild-type (WT) IBV-infected cells, and aberrant cleavage of IBV S on virions. We previously reported the formation of two distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E in transfected and infected cells. Disruption of the secretory pathway by IBV E correlates with a form that is likely monomeric, suggesting that the effects on the secretory pathway are independent of E ion channel activity. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the monomeric form of IBV E correlates with an increased Golgi luminal pH. Infection with IBV or expression of IBV E induces neutralization of Golgi pH, promoting a model in which IBV E alters the secretory pathway through interaction with host cell factors, protecting IBV S from premature cleavage and leading to the efficient release of infectious virus from the cells. This is the first demonstration of a coronavirus-induced alteration in the microenvironment of the secretory pathway. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are important human pathogens with significant zoonotic potential. Progress has been made toward identifying potential vaccine candidates for highly pathogenic human CoVs, including the use of attenuated viruses that lack the CoV E protein or express E mutants. However, no approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics exist. Understanding the role of the CoV E protein in virus assembly and release is thus an important prerequisite for potential vaccines as well as in identifying novel antiviral therapeutics.","publish_time":"2019-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Westerbeck, Jason W.; Machamer, Carolyn E.","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cbb9ec2328fdea46172cc0dd7f8fa8be82256c93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6532078.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867314/; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/11/e00015-19.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00015-19","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV E","IBV","IBV S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HD of IBV E","expression of IBV E","CoV E protein","monomeric form of IBV E correlates","IBV-infected cells","distinct oligomeric pools of IBV E","express E mutants","accumulation of IBV spike","aberrant cleavage of IBV S","secretory pathway","independent of E ion channel activity","virus assembly","efficient release of infectious virus","secretory system","impaired release of infectious virions","virion release","Golgi membranes","potential vaccines","protein plays roles","neutralization of Golgi pH","avian infectious bronchitis virus","small CoV envelope","increased Golgi luminal pH","early Golgi complex","recombinant virus background results","important human pathogens","pathogenic human CoVs","significant zoonotic potential","potential vaccine candidates","cation channel activity","novel antiviral therapeutics","important prerequisite","premature cleavage","dramatic effects","IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses","approved vaccines","impaired growth kinetics","host cell factors","interaction","wild-type","plasma membrane","microenvironment","use of attenuated viruses","single hydrophobic domain","coronavirus-induced alteration","Mutation","model","demonstration","formation","lumen","exocytosis","present evidence","residues","pathogenesis","Infection","Disruption","Progress"],"language":"en"},

Broad stakeholder input integrated throughout the research process can both increase relevance and facilitate study procedures. More flexible and rapid research designs should be considered before defaulting to the traditional two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), but even traditional RCTs can be designed for more rapid findings. Review processes for grant applications, IRB protocols, and manuscript submissions can be better streamlined to minimize delays. Research infrastructures such as rapid learning systems and other health information technologies can be leveraged to rapidly evaluate new and existing treatments, and alleviate the extensive recruitment delays common in traditional research.

These results provide important clues for better understanding of SARS-CoV ORF3 and trying new therapeutic strategies.","publish_time":"2005-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xue Wu; Yap, Yee Leng","journal":"Journal of Molecular Structure: THEOCHEM","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16a28a8a87866ad16d935338c02a95251cb0e85c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113666.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166128004008656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287548/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theochem.2004.10.073; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166128004008656","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","FAD/NAD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["structure of ORF3","CoV ORF3","SARS-CoV","predicted structure","function of ORF3","structure neighbors","SARS coronavirus","D model of ORF3","stability of protein structure","better understanding of SARS","\u03C0 interactions","pairs of non-canonical N","important clues","molecular modeling techniques","new therapeutic strategies","results","NAD binding","contributions","comparison","Abstract","FAD"],"language":"en"},

A universal RT nested PCR\u2010based system has been developed for subtyping H1, H3, N1 and N2, in influenza A viruses of human or animal origin. The subsequent sequencing and analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase templates reveal antigenic and receptor binding changes in the HA1 subunit and mutations of clinical relevance concerning resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. The specificity and sensitivity of the method were evaluated using 113 influenza A isolates, 105 influenza A positive respiratory samples obtained from patients and 29 prototype strains of both human and animal origin.

The beneficial effects of tea have been mostly attributed to its catechin content. Black tea is derived from the leaves of Camellia sinensis plant, and it is rich in theaflavin polyphenols, in particular theaflavin (TF1), theaflavin-3-monogallate (TF2A), theaflavin-3\u2032-monogallate (TF2B), and theaflavin-3,3\u2032-digallate (TF3). Vero and A549 cells were used to evaluate the effect of purified individual black tea theaflavins as anti-herpes simplex virus 1 agents. With the rise of HSV resistant strains, there is a critical need to develop novel antiherpesviral treatments. Results of the cytotoxicity assay tested by MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] showed that TF1, TF2, and TF3 are not toxic to Vero and A549 cells at a concentration up to 75\u03BCM. The antiviral activity of the individual theaflavins was tested by plaque reduction assay, MTS assay, flow cytometric analysis and confocal microscopy observations. The results showed that TF1, TF2, and TF3 exhibit potent, dose-dependent anti-HSV-1 effect, with TF3 being the most efficient in both Vero and A549 cells. A concentration of 50\u03BCM TF3 and above was sufficient to inhibit \u003E99% of the production of HSV-1 viral particles. The anti-HSV-1 effect of TF3 is due to a direct effect on the virions, and treating Vero or A549 cells with TF3 for 1h prior to infection, or treating the cells at different times post infection does not inhibit HSV-1 production. TF3 is stable at vaginal pH, indicating its potential to be a promising natural and affordable remedy against herpes simplex viral infections.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Oliveira, Aline; Prince, Derek; Lo, Chih-Yu; Lee, Lee H.; Chu, Tin-Chun","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dae1b104afc0990d60fe1cfaa88b90492cbce959.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113870.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.03.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635421500073X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25818500/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635421500073X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV","MTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of TF3","\u03BCM TF3","A549 cells","Vero","production of HSV","particular theaflavin","theaflavin polyphenols","TF1","individual black tea theaflavins","MTS assay","dose-dependent anti-HSV","direct effect","Abstract Tea","anti-herpes simplex virus","individual theaflavins","cytotoxicity assay","rise of HSV resistant strains","beneficial effects of tea","monogallate","concentration","Results","herpes simplex viral infections","plaque reduction assay","viral particles","different times post infection","affordable remedy","cytometric analysis","critical need","confocal microscopy observations","novel antiherpesviral treatments","potential","leaves of Camellia sinensis plant","vaginal pH","agents","virions","consumed drink","antiviral activity","TF2A","world","TF2B","digallate","catechin content","dimethylthiazol","carboxymethoxy-phenyl"],"language":"en"},

According to the quality indicators recommended by Sociedad Espa\u00F1ola de Medicina Intensiva Cr\u00EDtica y Unidades Coronarias, and due to the importance of prone position (PP) as a treatment in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is fundamental to keep accurate record of serious adverse events occurring during the prone position procedure and its posterior analysis. Objectives To establish fulfilment of the Sociedad Espa\u00F1ola de Medicina Intensiva Cr\u00EDtica y Unidades Coronarias standards of quality according to the register of serious complications. To identify the incidence of serious complications registered as well as to identify possible factors related to these complications. Method Retrospective, cross-sectional descriptive study, polyvalent ICU (16 beds). Study population Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with PP (January 2012\u2013December 2013). Study variables PP recording, accidental extubation, removal of catheters, decubitus ulcers (DU), ETT obstruction, urgency of the procedure, hours in PP, nutritional intake, type of feeding tube, food regurgitation/retention and use of prokinetics/muscle relaxant. Results The study sample comprised 38 cases, with an adequate record of complications in 92.1% of the cases. DU were the only serious complication recorded, with a 25.7% incidence. Possible factors related to DU: more hours in PP in patients developing DU (p =0.067). Less incidence of DU in well-nourished patients (p =0.577). 82.9% of patients were not appropriately nourished. Conclusions The percentage of records duly completed is very high. The presence of DU (grade 1\u20132 mostly) is to be noted. There is no statistical significance, although a trend is obsersed, between DU and hours in PP.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jov\u00E9 Ponseti, E.; Villarrasa Mill\u00E1n, A.; Ortiz Chinchilla, D.","journal":"Enfermer\u00EDa Intensiva (English ed.)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c019b2ec8cc99de831add42d89295ab3889c14f3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2529984017300277; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2529984017300277","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sociedad Espa\u00F1ola de Medicina Intensiva","ICU","DU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of serious complications","Study population Patients","well-nourished patients","register of serious complications","hours","Study variables PP recording","study sample","adequate record of complications","Medicina Intensiva Cr\u00EDtica y Unidades Coronarias standards of quality","Sociedad Espa\u00F1ola","acute respiratory distress syndrome","cross-sectional descriptive study","prone position procedure","quality indicators","cases","possible factors","accurate record of serious adverse events","importance of prone position","accidental extubation","type of feeding tube","nutritional intake","retention","removal of catheters","treatment","food regurgitation","polyvalent ICU","decubitus ulcers","monitoring system","ETT obstruction","Method Retrospective","prokinetics","urgency","posterior analysis","fulfilment","Abstract Introduction","beds","clinicians","percentage of records","muscle relaxant","statistical significance","trend","Conclusions","Objectives","patient\u0027s care","presence","grade"],"language":"en"},

These viruses are released into the environment by various routes including water runoffs and aerosols. Furthermore, zoonotic viruses may infect humans exposed to contaminated surface waters. Viruses are emerging pathogens and are able to adapt by mutation, recombination, and reassortment and can thus become able to infect new hosts and to adjust to new environments. Enteric viruses are among the commonest and most hazardous waterborne pathogens, causing both sporadic and outbreak-related illness. While considerable research has documented the risk of enteric viruses to human health from contact with contaminated water, the current bacterial indicator-based methods for the evaluation of water quality are often ineffectual proxies for pathogenic viruses, but no correlation was established between the enteric bacteria and viruses studied. The present chapter will focus on viral pathogens shown to be transmitted through water. It will also provide an overview of viruses that had not been a concern for waterborne transmission in the past, but that may represent potentially emerging waterborne pathogens due to their occurrence and persistence in water environments. Monitoring effluents from wastewater treatment plants is important to preventing both environmental contamination and the spread of disease.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouseettine, Rihab; Hassou, Najwa; Bessi, Hlima; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha","journal":"Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e5b02da33d4a39e65f941412325663fcfd84fa1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148740.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128194003000405; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128194003000405","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs0NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenic viruses","zoonotic viruses","overview of viruses","risk of enteric viruses","contaminated water","water environments","Abstract Viruses of human","water runoffs","emerging pathogens","emerging waterborne pathogens","evaluation of water quality","hazardous waterborne pathogens","viral pathogens","enteric bacteria","waterborne transmission","new environments","human health","new hosts","spread of disease","contaminated surface waters","contact","current bacterial indicator-based methods","occurrence","wastewater treatment plants","ineffectual proxies","various routes","humans","animal origin","Monitoring effluents","environmental contamination","aerosols","concern","correlation","persistence","outbreak-related illness","mutation","recombination","reassortment","past","present chapter","people","considerable research","food"],"language":"en"},

We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations.

A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial","doi":"10.3389/fped.2019.00431","pmcid":"PMC6874056","pubmed_id":"31803694","license":"cc-by","abstract":"Background: Pneumonia caused 704,000 deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2015. Zinc is an important micronutrient due to its role in immune function. Since 2004, WHO recommends zinc supplementation for children with diarrhea to shorten the duration and decrease severity. Zinc supplementation for children with pneumonia is controversial. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted, and 103 children 1 month to 5 years old with pneumonia were included. Zinc or placebo was given during hospitalization. Clinical symptoms were recorded, and a blood draw was obtained to determine serum zinc levels, lymphoproliferation, and cytokines at hospitalization and at discharge of the patient; a nasal wash was obtained to detect viral or bacterial pathogens by multiplex RT-PCR. Results: Zinc supplementation improved in fewer hours the clinical status (76 \u00B1 7 vs. 105 \u00B1 8, p = 0.01), the respiratory rate (37 \u00B1 6 vs. 57 \u00B1 7, p = 0.04), and the oxygen saturation (53 \u00B1 7 vs. 87 \u00B1 9, p = 0.007) compared to the placebo group. An increase in IFN\u03B3 and IL-2 after treatment in the zinc group was observed.

Infants of mothers with asthma are more likely to wheeze and have a higher risk of developing asthma than infants of non\u2010asthmatic mothers. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of viral infection in pregnancy was conducted between 2007 and 2009, and a subgroup of infants of mothers with asthma was followed up at 6 and 12 months of age. During common colds, nasal and throat swabs were collected from mothers and respiratory viruses detected by polymerase chain reaction. Respiratory health of infants was assessed by parent\u2010completed questionnaire. RESULTS: Twelve\u2010month\u2010old infants whose mothers had confirmed viral infections in pregnancy (n = 26) reported more frequent wheeze (40% had 4\u201312 wheeze attacks compared with 0%), sleep disturbed by wheeze (1 night per week or more in 60% vs. 11%), beta agonist treatment for wheeze (27% vs. 0%), prolonged colds (2 wk or longer 31% vs. 0%), more eczema (40% vs. 6.3%), and parent\u2010perceived asthma (32% vs. 0%), compared with infants whose mothers had common colds without laboratory\u2010confirmed viral infection (n = 16). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a relationship between maternal respiratory viral infection in pregnancy and wheezing illness in infants of mothers with asthma. Viral infections are the most common cause of asthma exacerbations in pregnancy, and infants of asthmatic mothers are at increased risk of asthma themselves. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved.","publish_time":"2013-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murphy, Vanessa E.; Mattes, Joerg; Powell, Heather; Baines, Katherine J.; Gibson, Peter G.","journal":"Pediatr Allergy Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f34a885bd81dc0187cc442033e3861d90776605.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168064.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.12156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24329935/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Infants of mothers","infants of asthmatic mothers","pregnancy","infants of non\u2010asthmatic mothers","perceived asthma","old infants","subgroup of infants","Respiratory health of infants","viral infections","increased risk of asthma","maternal respiratory viral infection","common cause of asthma exacerbations","higher risk of developing asthma","common colds","frequent wheeze","wheeze attacks","prospective cohort study of viral infection","respiratory viruses","relationship","prolonged colds","parent","wheezing illness","laboratory","throat swabs","polymerase chain reaction","studies","METHODS","night","beta agonist treatment","offspring","RESULTS","wk","CONCLUSIONS","sleep","week","months of age","research","mechanisms","BACKGROUND","questionnaire","eczema"],"language":"en"},

A total of 729 human cell membrane proteins were predicted to constitute the receptorome for the human-infecting virome. Combination of the random-forest model with protein-protein interactions between human and viruses predicted in previous studies further predicted receptors for 693 human-infecting viruses, such as the Enterovirus, Norovirus and West Nile virus.

The Impact of Events Scale\u2013Revised (IES-R) was administered to the practitioners twice, once during the hospital shutdown and again one month after the shutdown. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered to patients undergoing hemodialysis. Results During the initial stages of the MERS outbreak, healthcare workers who performed MERS-related tasks scored significantly higher on the total IES-R and its subscales. In the second assessment of the high-risk group, the sleep and numbness subscale scores from the IES-R differed depending on the implementation of home quarantine, and the intrusion subscale scores differed depending on the performance of MERS-related tasks. Conclusion Medical staff that performed MERS-related tasks showed the highest risk for post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms even after time had elapsed. The risk increased even after home quarantine.

The phospholipid content of the ER membrane differs from that of the plasma membrane (PM). The phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) superfamily consists of a large number of members that specifically catalyse the hydrolysis of phospholipids at a particular position.

Rates of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) are comparable to those in high-income countries. The program\u0027s evolution has been characterized by ambitious target setting and innovative strategies that have not been widely described. Methods We reviewed national and provincial health department archives; analyzed disease surveillance, vaccination coverage, and serosurvey data from 1950 through 2016; and, conducted in-depth interviews with senior Chinese experts involved early VPD control efforts. Results Widespread immunization began in the 1950s with smallpox, diphtheria, and Bacillus-Calmette Guerin vaccines, and in the 1960s with pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles, and Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccines. The largest drops in absolute VPD burden occurred in the 1970s with establishment of the Rural Cooperative Medical System and a cadre of trained peasant health workers whose responsibilities included vaccinations. From 1970 to 1979, incidence per 100,000 population dropped 48% from 3.3 to 1.75 for diphtheria, 50% from 152.2 to 49.4 for pertussis, 77% from 2.5 to 0.6 for polio, 60% from 450.5 to 178.3 for measles, and 72% from 18.0 to 5.1 for JE, averting an average of 4 million VPD cases each year. Until the early 1980s, vaccines were delivered through annual winter campaigns using a coordinated \u2018rush-relay\u2019 system to expedite transport while leveraging vaccine thermostability. Establishment of the cold chain system during in the 1980s allowed bi-monthly vaccination rounds and more timely vaccination resulting in rates of diphtheria, pertussis, measles and meningitis falling over 90% from 1980 to 1989, while polio and JE rates fell 40\u201350%. In the 1990s, progress stalled as financing for public health was weakened by broad market reforms. Large investments in public health and immunizations by the central government since 2004 has led to further declines in VPD burden and increased equity. During 2011\u20132016, the incidence per 100,000 population was \u003C2.0 for measles and \u003C0.2 for pertussis, JE, meningococcal meningitis, and hepatitis A. From 1992 to 2014, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection in children \u003C5 years fell from 9.7% to 0.3%, a 97% decline. China was certified polio-free in 2000 and diphtheria was last reported in 2006. Conclusions Long-term political commitment to immunizations as a basic right, ambitious targets, use of disease incidence as the primary metric to assess program performance, and nationwide scale-up of successful locally developed strategies that optimized use of available limited resources have been critical to China\u0027s success in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases.","publish_time":"2018-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Wenzhou; Lee, Lisa A.; Liu, Yanmin; Scherpbier, Robert W.; Wen, Ning; Zhang, Guomin; Zhu, Xu; Ning, Guijun; Wang, Fuzhen; Li, Yixing; Hao, Lixin; Zhang, Xuan; Wang, Huaqing","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9473b4c6c037e520377747f6d02eeb74bf038d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115483.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18313574; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X18313574; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.10.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30497834/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rural Cooperative Medical System","JE"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["measles","pertussis","rates of diphtheria","JE rates","public health","VPD cases","Rates of vaccine","absolute VPD burden","disease incidence","vaccine-preventable diseases","early VPD control efforts","immunizations","timely vaccination","vaccination coverage","establishment","vaccine thermostability","certified polio-free","population","provincial health department archives","cold chain system","cadre of trained peasant health workers","Abstract Background China\u0027s immunization program","disease surveillance","Rural Cooperative Medical System","bi-monthly vaccination rounds","ambitious targets","China\u0027s success","program performance","developed strategies","Bacillus-Calmette Guerin vaccines","innovative strategies","meningococcal meningitis","largest drops","Widespread immunization","use of available limited resources","prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection","senior Chinese experts","basic right","children","responsibilities","annual winter campaigns","primary metric","Conclusions Long-term political commitment","Japanese encephalitis","in-depth interviews","nationwide scale","rush-relay","vaccinations","transport","declines","increased equity","Large investments","progress","financing","tetanus","broad market reforms","serosurvey data","central government","years","Methods","average","smallpox","program\u0027s evolution","high-income countries","world"],"language":"en"},

Cross-sectional studies have shown that the number of circulating pDCs in HIV patients, compared to that in uninfected individuals, is reduced. However, since the time of infection is usually unknown in HIV-infected patients, pDC-virus interactions that occur immediately after virus exposure are poorly understood. The current study investigated pDC dynamics during acute and chronic infections of macaques with either SIVmac239 or the pathogenic SIV-HIV chimera, SHIV-89.6P, as models for HIV infection. In three rhesus and three pig-tailed macaques infected intravenously with SIVmac239, the percentages of pDCs in blood declined 2- to 6-fold during the first 6 weeks after infection and remained depressed throughout the disease course. Surprisingly, no consistent, comparable decline in peripheral blood pDCs was observed in six macaques infected with SHIV-89.6P. In this latter group, percentages of pDCs did not correlate with CD4(\u002B) T cells, but there was an inverse relationship with viral load. In addition, when compared to na\u00EFve controls, the percentages of pDCs were reduced in spleens and peripheral lymph nodes of SIVmac239- but not SHIV-89.6P-infected animals that had progressed to AIDS. Proviral DNA was detected during the acute phase in pDCs isolated from macaques infected with either virus. These results imply that, even though macaque pDCs can be infected by both SIVmac239 and SHIV-89.6P, the subsequent effects on in vivo pathogenesis differ.

The element is ubiquitous also in freshwater and nutrients. The average body load of a human individual amounts to 1 mg. The omnipresence of vanadium hampers checks directed towards its essentiality. However, since vanadate can be considered a close blueprint of phosphate with respect to its built-up, vanadate likely takes over a regulatory function in metabolic processes depending on phosphate. At common concentrations, vanadium is non-toxic. The main source for potentially toxic effects caused by vanadium is exposure to high loads of vanadium oxides in the breathing air of vanadium processing industrial enterprises. Vanadium can enter the body via the lungs or, more commonly, the stomach. Most of the dietary vanadium is excreted. The amount of vanadium resorbed in the gastrointestinal tract is a function of its oxidation state (V(V) or V(IV)) and the coordination environment. Vanadium compounds that enter the blood stream are subjected to speciation. The predominant vanadium species in blood are vanadate and vanadyl bound to transferrin. From the blood stream, vanadium becomes distributed to the body tissues and bones. Bones act as storage pool for vanadate. The aqueous chemistry of vanadium(V) at concentration \u003C10 \u03BCM is dominated by vanadate. At higher concentrations, oligovanadates come in, decavanadate in particular, which is thermodynamically stable in the pH range 2.3\u20136.3, and can further be stabilized at higher pH by interaction with proteins. The similarity between vanadate and phosphate accounts for the interplay between vanadate and phosphate-dependent enzymes: phosphatases can be inhibited, kinases activated. As far as medicinal applications of vanadium compounds are concerned, vanadium\u2019s mode of action appears to be related to the phosphate-vanadate antagonism, to the direct interaction of vanadium compounds or fragments thereof with DNA, and to vanadium\u2019s contribution to a balanced tissue level of reactive oxygen species. So far vanadium compounds have not yet found approval for medicinal applications. The antidiabetic (insulin-enhancing) effect, however, of a singular vanadium complex, bis(ethylmaltolato)oxidovanadium(IV) (BEOV), has revealed encouraging results in phase IIa clinical tests. In addition, in vitro studies with cell cultures and parasites, as well as in vivo studies with animals, have revealed a broad potential spectrum for the application of vanadium coordination compounds in the treatment of cardiac and neuronal disorders, malignant tumors, viral and bacterial infections (such as influenza, HIV, and tuberculosis), and tropical diseases caused by parasites, e.g., Chagas\u2019 disease, leishmaniasis, and amoebiasis.","publish_time":"2013-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rehder, Dieter","journal":"Interrelations between Essential Metal Ions and Human Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fb68e502fc106fe515f9061a84947d90f52efa8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120733.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24470091/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-7500-8_5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dietary vanadium","predominant vanadium species","medicinal applications of vanadium compounds","singular vanadium complex","omnipresence of vanadium hampers","aqueous chemistry of vanadium","direct interaction of vanadium compounds","application of vanadium coordination compounds","high loads of vanadium oxides","phosphate-vanadate antagonism","breathing air of vanadium processing industrial enterprises","phosphate accounts","blood stream","phosphate-dependent enzymes","close blueprint of phosphate","parasites","body tissues","abundant element","studies","higher concentrations","higher pH","average body load","vanadium\u2019s contribution","regulatory function","Bones act","common concentrations","coordination environment","pH range","abundant transition metal","vanadium\u2019s mode of action","balanced tissue level of reactive oxygen species","malignant tumors","exposure","treatment of cardiac","encouraging results","neuronal disorders","interplay","bacterial infections","human individual amounts","phase IIa clinical tests","toxic effects","bis","ethylmaltolato","respect","DNA","fragments","broad potential spectrum","oxidation state","tuberculosis","influenza","oxidovanadium","sea water","oligovanadates","cell cultures","phosphatases","metabolic processes","storage pool","vanadyl","approval","gastrointestinal tract","leishmaniasis","HIV","main source","BEOV","freshwater","decavanadate","Chagas","tropical diseases","addition","animals","Earth\u2019s crust","proteins","\u03BCM","similarity","antidiabetic","insulin","nutrients","amoebiasis","transferrin","speciation","essentiality","kinases","lungs","stomach"],"language":"en"},

In extreme cases, such as the influenza pandemic of 1918, tens of millions of people have died from the infection. To prepare for future influenza outbreaks, it is necessary to understand how the virus interacts with the host and to determine what makes certain strains of influenza highly pathogenic. Functional genomics provides a unique approach to this effort by allowing researchers to examine the effect of influenza infection on global host mRNA levels. Researchers are making increasing use of this approach to study virus\u2013host interactions using a variety of model systems. For example, data obtained using microarray technology, in combination with mouse and macaque infection models, is providing exciting new insights into the pathogenicity of the 1918 virus. These studies suggest that the lethality associated with this virus is in part due to an aberrant and unchecked immune response.

The most frequent SARS concerns were about the care of non-SARS patients following suspension of nonessential services and loss of physician income.","publish_time":"2005-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grace, Sherry L.; Hershenfield, Karen; Robertson, Emma; Stewart, Donna E.","journal":"Psychosomatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b05746a0012e2c6d431e8472c614da93c5aa825.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118753.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033318205700499; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033318205700499","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs4NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Toronto"],"keyphrases":["direct care","care of non-SARS patients","frequent SARS concerns","identified SARS symptoms","directory-listed physicians","suspension of nonessential services","network","large teaching hospitals","loss of physician income","higher rate of psychological distress","Toronto","cross-sectional anonymous survey"],"language":"en"},

Outbreak management is essential to reduce the impact in both the institution and the surrounding community. Through the use of an online survey, we aimed to measure the perceptions and responses of staff and students towards pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at a major university in Sydney, Australia. METHODS: The survey was available online from 29 June to 30 September 2009. The sample included academic staff, general staff and students of the University. RESULTS: A total of 2882 surveys were completed. Nearly all respondents (99.6%, 2870/2882) were aware of the Australian pandemic situation and 64.2% (1851/2882) reported either \u0022no anxiety\u0022 or \u0022disinterest.\u0022 Asian-born respondents were significantly (p \u003C 0.001) more likely to believe that the pandemic was serious compared to respondents from other regions. 75.9% (2188/2882) of respondents had not made any lifestyle changes as a result of the pandemic. Most respondents had not adopted any specific behaviour change, and only 20.8% (600/2882) had adopted the simplest health behaviour, i.e. hand hygiene. Adoption of a specific behaviour change was linked to anxiety and Asian origin. Students were more likely to attend the university if unwell compared with staff members. Positive responses from students strongly indicate the potential for expanding online teaching and learning resources for continuing education in disaster settings. Willingness to receive the pandemic vaccine was associated with seasonal influenza vaccination uptake over the previous 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Responses to a pandemic are subject to change in its pre-, early and mid-outbreak stages. Lessons for these institutions in preparation for a second wave and future disease outbreaks include the need to promote positive public health behaviours amongst young people and students.","publish_time":"2010-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van, Debbie; McLaws, Mary-Louise; Crimmins, Jacinta; MacIntyre, C Raina; Seale, Holly","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73939a4a3eff4347a97d4dbe05c46a3a1fc08a82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2841672.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20226093/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["students","respondents","pandemic vaccine","responses of staff","pandemic young adults","Australian pandemic situation","specific behaviour change","general staff","academic staff","staff members","Positive responses","online survey","potential","simplest health behaviour","major university","Outbreak management","online teaching","anxiety","explosive disease outbreak centres","mid-outbreak stages","positive public health behaviours","young people","Asian origin","future disease outbreaks","learning resources","need","continuing education","Universities","seasonal influenza vaccination uptake","wave","H1N1","disaster settings","preparation","sample","lifestyle changes","impact","institutions","years","Sydney","hygiene","BACKGROUND","Adoption","perceptions","RESULTS","total","surveys","surrounding community","Lessons","METHODS","regions","Willingness","use","CONCLUSIONS","disinterest"],"language":"en"},

Among its major functions are conservation of energy during starvation, recycling organelles, and turnover of long-lived proteins. Besides, autophagy plays a critical role in removing intracellular pathogens and very likely represents a primordial intrinsic cellular defence mechanism. More recent findings indicate that it has not only retained its ability to degrade intracellular pathogens, but also functions to augment and fine tune antiviral immune responses. Interestingly, viruses have also co-evolved strategies to manipulate this pathway and use it to their advantage. Particularly intriguing is infection-dependent activation of autophagy with positive stranded (\u002B)RNA virus infections, which benefit from the pathway without succumbing to lysosomal degradation. In this review we summarise recent data on viral manipulation of autophagy, with a particular emphasis on \u002BRNA viruses and highlight key unanswered questions in the field that we believe merit further attention.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Ho Him; Sanyal, Sumana","journal":"Seminars in Cell \u0026 Developmental Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28437fde7d8fcc4d4440d3b342815cb5956bd7ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102625.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31382014/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084952118302222; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2019.07.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1084952118302222","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Abstract Autophagy","RNA viruses","viral manipulation of autophagy","pathway","intracellular pathogens","infection-dependent activation of autophagy","recent data","major functions","recent findings","RNA virus infections","recycling organelles","starvation","conservation of energy","field","key unanswered questions","conserved process central","particular emphasis","primordial intrinsic cellular defence mechanism","fine tune antiviral immune responses","turnover of long-lived proteins","co-evolved strategies","critical role","metabolism","review","merit","attention","lysosomal degradation","ability","advantage"],"language":"en"},

Our aim was to develop a module of questions for use in telephone health surveys on perceptions of threat of pandemic influenza, and on preparedness to comply with specific public health behaviours in the event of pandemic influenza. METHODS: A module of questions was developed and field tested on 192 adults using the New South Wales Department of Health\u0027s in-house Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) facility. The questions were then modified and re field tested on 202 adults. The module was then incorporated into the New South Wales Population Health Survey in the first quarter of 2007. A representative sample of 2,081 adults completed the module. Their responses were weighted against the state population. RESULTS: The reliability of the questions was acceptable with kappa ranging between 0.25 and 0.51. Overall 14.9% of the state population thought pandemic influenza was very or extremely likely to occur; 45.5% were very or extremely concerned that they or their family would be affected by pandemic influenza if it occurred; and 23.8% had made some level of change to the way they live their life because of the possibility of pandemic influenza. In the event of pandemic influenza, the majority of the population were willing to: be vaccinated (75.4%), be isolated (70.2%), and wear a face mask (59.9%). People with higher levels of threat perception are significantly more likely to be willing to comply with specific public health behaviours. CONCLUSION: While only 14.9% of the state population thought pandemic influenza was very or extremely likely to occur, a significantly higher proportion were concerned for self and family should a pandemic actually occur. The baseline data collected in this survey will be useful for monitoring changes over time in the population\u0027s perceptions of threat, and preparedness to comply with specific public health behaviours.","publish_time":"2008-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barr, Margo; Raphael, Beverley; Taylor, Melanie; Stevens, Garry; Jorm, Louisa; Giffin, Michael; Lujic, Sanja","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16627f4c7134394da448b1417a771d13ad7cca4a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2556339.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18793441/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-8-117","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYwLmNzdjs5MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681345,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"wi8f3f10dEA7GPhMmzRSSg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_60.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Computer Assisted Telephone"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["threat of pandemic influenza","event of pandemic influenza","possibility of pandemic influenza","state population","module of questions","specific public health behaviours","New South Wales Population Health Survey","adults","telephone health surveys","population\u0027s perceptions of threat","preparedness","higher levels of threat perception","Baseline data","family","field","Telephone Interviewing","monitoring changes","New South Wales Department of Health\u0027s in-house Computer","higher proportion","time","CATI","majority","People","self","life","way","facility","reliability","BACKGROUND","quarter","representative sample","level of change","RESULTS","kappa","METHODS","responses","face mask","aim","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Pneumonia accounts for 16% of all deaths of children under 5 years of age and was the cause of death of 935000 children in 2015. Despite its frequency and severity, information regarding its etiology is limited. The aim of this study was to identify respiratory viruses associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children younger than 5 years old. Methods One thousand four hundred and four children younger than 5 years of age with a clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of CAP in 11 hospitals in Mexico were included. Nasal washes were collected, placed in viral medium, and frozen at \u221270\u00B0C until processing. The first 832 samples were processed using the multiplex Bio\u2010Plex/Luminex system and the remaining 572 samples using the Anyplex multiplex RT-PCR. Clinical data regarding diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic pattern, and risk factors were obtained and recorded. Results Of the samples tested, 81.6% were positive for viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B) was found in 23.7%, human enterovirus/rhinovirus in 16.6%, metapneumovirus in 5.7%, parainfluenza virus (types 1\u20134) in 5.5%, influenza virus (types A and B) in 3.6%, adenovirus in 2.2%, coronavirus (NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1) in 2.2%, and bocavirus in 0.4%. Co-infection with two or more viruses was present in 22.1%; 18.4% of the samples were negative. Using biomass for cooking, daycare attendance, absence of breastfeeding, and co-infections were found to be statistically significant risk factors for the presence of severe pneumonia. Conclusions Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B), human enterovirus/rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were the respiratory viruses identified most frequently in children younger than 5 years old with CAP. Co-infection was present in an important proportion of the children.","publish_time":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong-Chew, Rosa Mar\u00EDa; Garc\u00EDa-Le\u00F3n, Miguel L.; Noyola, Daniel E.; Perez Gonzalez, Luis F.; Gaitan Meza, Jes\u00FAs; Vilase\u00F1or-Sierra, Alberto; Martinez-Aguilar, Gerardo; Rivera-Nu\u00F1ez, Victor Hugo; Newton-S\u00E1nchez, Oscar A.; Firo-Reyes, Ver\u00F3nica; Del R\u00EDo-Almendarez, Carlos N.; Gonz\u00E1lez-Rodr\u00EDguez, Alejandra Pamela; Ortiz-Garc\u00EDa, Enrique R.; Navarrete-Navarro, Susana; Soria-Rodr\u00EDguez, Carmen; Carrasco-Castillo, Adoniram; S\u00E1nchez-Medina, Eneida; L\u00F3pez-Mart\u00EDnez, Irma; Hern\u00E1ndez-Andrade, Teresa; Alpuche-Aranda, Celia M.; Santos-Preciado, Jos\u00E9 I.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43e6e8580066e1b1cc44c816885e2b6262c2f7f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110468.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28673837/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971217301753; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971217301753; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2017.06.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","Anyplex"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["children younger","respiratory viruses","types","deaths of children","samples","years old","Conclusions Respiratory syncytial virus","years of age","co-infections","parainfluenza virus","clinical signs","Clinical data","Abstract Background Acute respiratory infections","rhinovirus","metapneumovirus","human enterovirus","Pneumonia accounts","radiological diagnosis of CAP","significant risk factors","presence of severe pneumonia","multiplex Bio","cause of death","leading cause of mortality","Anyplex multiplex RT-PCR","Luminex system","radiographic pattern","symptoms","absence of breastfeeding","daycare attendance","important proportion","OC43","cooking","hospitals","community","severity","information","coronavirus","NL63","biomass","study","viral medium","frequency","etiology","HKU1","Mexico","adenovirus","developing countries","Nasal washes","processing","aim","Results","Methods","bocavirus"],"language":"en"},

Documentation of virus infection using PCR and clinical characteristics of patients affected with viral pneumonia are reviewed in this study. Methods 51 children less than three years admitted to the Pediatric Hospital, Cairo University with viral pneumonia were included. All patients had undergone nasopharyngeal aspirate for PCR viral detection. Results A total of 51 cases were enrolled in the study, of which 7 cases were negative while 44 children were positive for viruses. The most common respiratory virus was Rhinovirus in 32 patients (72.2%), then parainfluenza virus (PIV) in 12 (27.3%), of which subtypes PIV1 were 2 (4.5%), PIV3 were 5 (11.4%) and PIV4 were 5 (11.4%) cases. The third common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 9 (20.5%) cases of which 3 (6.8%) were RSVA and 6 (13.6%) were RSVB and adenovirus in 9 cases (20.5%). Boca virus was found in 8 (18.2%) patients, corona virus 2 (4.5%) patients, H1N1 2 (4.5%) patients, enterovirus 2 patients (4.5%) and human metapneumovirus in one case (2.3%).

Universal methods for rapidly identifying and screening candidate antivirals are urgently needed. We have developed a modular antiviral platform strategy that relies on simple bioinformatic and genetic information about each pathogen. Central to this platform is the use of envelope glycoprotein cDNAs to establish multi-cycle replication systems under BSL2 conditions for viral pathogens that normally require BSL3 and BSL4 facilities. We generated monoclonal antibodies against Nipah G by cDNA immunization in rats, and we showed that these antibodies neutralize both Nipah and Hendra live viruses. We then used these effective Henipavirus inhibitors to validate our screening strategy. Our proposed strategy should contribute to the response capability for emerging infectious diseases, providing a way to initiate antiviral development immediately upon identifying novel viruses.","publish_time":"2012-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Talekar, Aparna; Pessi, Antonello; Glickman, Fraser; Sengupta, Uttara; Briese, Thomas; Whitt, Michael A.; Mathieu, Cyrille; Horvat, Branka; Moscona, Anne; Porotto, Matteo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03e9a22249dd6e201e347bb87cf96a931120f5c5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3292545.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22396728/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030538","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":["Nipah G"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Emerging viruses","Nipah G","Junin viruses","screening strategy","novel viruses","Nipah virus","Hendra live viruses","modular antiviral platform strategy","emerging infectious diseases","proposed strategy","BSL2 conditions","viral pathogens","antiviral development","monoclonal antibodies","human transmission","high biocontainment conditions","screening candidate antivirals","multi-cycle replication systems","use of envelope glycoprotein cDNAs","simple bioinformatic","Lujo","cDNA immunization","response capability","way","genetic information","BSL3","rats","effective Henipavirus inhibitors","enormous potential","capacity","BSL4 facilities","Universal methods","zoonosis"],"language":"en"},

Focusing on the USA and the UK, we discuss seven approaches: education (especially of non-clinical managers, policy-makers, and the public), organisational guidelines, performance reporting, financial and sociobehavioural incentives to health-care professionals and institutions, regulation, legal requirements, and health-care system reorganisation. No single action is likely to have sustained effect and we recommend a combination of approaches. Several recent initiatives that hold promise tie performance reporting to financial incentives. Though performance reporting has been hampered by concerns over cost and accuracy, it remains an essential component and we recommend continued effort in this area. We also recommend more public education and use of organisational guidelines, such as admission criteria and staffing levels in intensive care units. Even if these endeavours are successful, with rising demand for services and continuing pressure to control costs, optimum care of the critically ill will not be realised without a fundamental reorganisation of services. In both the USA and UK, we recommend exploration of regionalised care, akin to US state trauma systems, and greater use of physician-extenders, such as nurse practitioners, to provide enhanced access to specialist care for critical illness.","publish_time":"2004-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Angus, Derek C; Black, Nick","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0a20f5252e7ab839bf1dfedb19b8a9c01fb08fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124584.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604160078; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673604160078","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specialist care","optimum care","health-care professionals","health-care system approaches","health-care system reorganisation","exploration of regionalised care","intensive care units","tie performance reporting","financial incentives","organisational guidelines","public education","combination of approaches","UK","USA","fundamental reorganisation of services","sociobehavioural incentives","greater use of physician","US state trauma systems","continuing pressure","enhanced access","admission criteria","rising demand","staffing levels","institutions","regulation","legal requirements","non-clinical managers","bedside strategies","extenders","policy-makers","costs","sustained effect","nurse practitioners","critical illness","Summary Institutional","continued effort","accuracy","essential component","concerns","single action","recent initiatives","endeavours","area"],"language":"en"},

Although syngeneic myogenic stem cell transplants have been successful in mice, allogeneic transplants of myogenic stem cells were ineffective in several human trials. To determine whether allogeneic muscle progenitor cells can be successfully transplanted in an immune-tolerant recipient, we induced immune tolerance in two DMD-affected (cxmd) dogs through hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Injection of freshly isolated muscle-derived cells from the HCT donor into either fully or partially chimeric xmd recipients restored dystrophin expression up to 6.48% of wild-type levels, reduced the number of centrally located nuclei, and improved muscle structure. Dystrophin expression was maintained for at least 24 weeks. Taken together, these data indicate that immune tolerance to donor myoblasts provides an important platform from which to further improve myoblast transplantation, with the goal of restoring dystrophin expression to patients with DMD.","publish_time":"2008-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parker, Maura H; Kuhr, Christian; Tapscott, Stephen J; Storb, Rainer","journal":"Molecular Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8eb11695a4ba6f459acc7eb15148d931d436606.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2536604.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/mt.2008.102; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525001616324765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18500253/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001616324765","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DMD","allogeneic transplants of myogenic stem cells","source of stem cells","allogeneic muscle progenitor cells","isolated muscle-derived cells","goal of restoring dystrophin expression","syngeneic myogenic stem cell transplants","immune tolerance","goal of myogenic stem cell transplant therapy","existing muscle fibers","future muscle generation","improved muscle structure","hematopoietic cell transplantation","HCT donor","Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy","immune-tolerant recipient","donor myoblasts","severe form of muscular dystrophy","myoblast transplantation","mice","dogs","located nuclei","cxmd","patients","chimeric xmd recipients","number","important platform","humans","human trials","wild-type levels","Injection","data","weeks"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The qualitative research team conducted 48 hours of observation in six wards from three Bangladeshi tertiary hospitals in 2007. They recorded environmental contamination with body secretions and excretions and medical waste and observed ward occupant handwashing and use of personal protective equipment. They recorded number of persons, number of open doors and windows, and use of fans. They measured the ward area and informally observed waste disposal outside the wards. They conducted nine focus group discussions with doctors, nurses and support staff. RESULTS: A median of 3.7 persons were present per 10 m(2) of floor space in the wards. A median of 4.9 uncovered coughs or sneezes were recorded per 10 m(2) per hour per ward. Floors in the wards were soiled with saliva, spit, mucous, vomitus, feces and blood 125 times in 48 hours. Only two of the 12 patient handwashing stations had running water and none had soap. No disinfection was observed before or after using medical instruments. Used medical supplies were often discarded in open containers under the beds. Handwashing with soap was observed in only 32 of 3,373 handwashing opportunities noted during 48 hours. Mosquitoes and feral cats were commonly observed in the wards. CONCLUSIONS: The physical structure and environment of our study hospitals are conducive to the spread of infection to people in the wards. Low-cost interventions on hand hygiene and cleaning procedures for rooms and medical equipment should be developed and evaluated for their practicality and effectiveness.","publish_time":"2014-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rimi, Nadia Ali; Sultana, Rebeca; Luby, Stephen P.; Islam, Mohammed Saiful; Uddin, Main; Hossain, Mohammad Jahangir; Zaman, Rashid Uz; Nahar, Nazmun; Gurley, Emily S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5926e0775494fcad788d2e93e3a5ddac4d5aeb0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3929649.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0089085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24586516/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Bangladesh"],"keyphrases":["medical waste","selected hospital wards","medical equipment","ward occupant handwashing","medical supplies","medical instruments","handwashing opportunities","physical structure","environmental contamination","study hospitals","government hospitals","number of persons","hours of observation","ward area","patient handwashing stations","median","soap","number of open doors","Bangladeshi tertiary hospitals","waste disposal","open containers","personal protective equipment","cleaning procedures","excretions","doctors","nurses","vomitus","hand hygiene","rooms","body secretions","feces","blood","qualitative research team","Low-cost interventions","spread of infection","focus group discussions","times","windows","saliva","water","paper","support staff","METHODS","uncovered coughs","sneezes","CONCLUSIONS","people","feral cats","Mosquitoes","beds","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","floor space","practicality","effectiveness","fans","Floors","disinfection"],"language":"en"},

In the rat brain, a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of NA induces myelin vacuolation in axonal tracts. Here, we explore the nature, the time course, and the role of the complement system in this damage. METHODS: The spatiotemporal analysis of myelin vacuolation was performed by optical and electron microscopy. Myelin basic protein-positive area and oligodendrocyte transcription factor (Olig2)-positive cells were quantified in the damaged bundles. Neuronal death in the affected axonal tracts was assessed by Fluoro-Jade B and anti-caspase-3 staining. To evaluate the role of the complement, membrane attack complex (MAC) deposition on damaged bundles was analyzed using anti-C5b9. Rats ICV injected with the anaphylatoxin C5a were studied for myelin damage. In addition, NA-induced vacuolation was studied in rats with different degrees of complement inhibition: normal rats treated with anti-C5-blocking antibody and C6-deficient rats. RESULTS: The stria medullaris, the optic chiasm, and the fimbria were the most consistently damaged axonal tracts. Vacuolation peaked 7 days after NA injection and reverted by day 15. Olig2\u002B cell number in the damaged tracts was unaltered, and neurodegeneration associated with myelin alterations was not detected. MAC was absent on damaged axonal tracts, as revealed by C5b9 immunostaining. Rats ICV injected with the anaphylatoxin C5a displayed no myelin injury. When the complement system was experimentally or constitutively inhibited, NA-induced myelin vacuolation was similar to that observed in normal rats. CONCLUSION: Microbial NA induces a moderate and transient myelin vacuolation that is not caused either by neuroinflammation or complement system activation.","publish_time":"2017-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Granados-Dur\u00E1n, Pablo; L\u00F3pez-\u00C1valos, Mar\u00EDa Dolores; Cifuentes, Manuel; P\u00E9rez-Mart\u00EDn, Margarita; Fern\u00E1ndez-Arjona, Mar\u00EDa del Mar; Hughes, Timothy R.; Johnson, Krista; Morgan, B.

While not as well studied in the natural reservoirs, the pro-inflammatory response and viral replication appear controlled and show no obvious pathology. In contrast, infection in humans results in an initial high viral load marked by an aggressive pro-inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm. The key difference in the course of the infection between the reservoir and human host is the inflammatory response. In this investigation, we apply a simple two-component differential equation model for pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses and a detailed mathematical analysis to identify specific regions in parameter space for single stable endemic equilibrium, bistability or periodic solutions. The extensions of the deterministic model to two stochastic models account for variability in responses seen at the cell (local) or tissue (global) levels. Numerical solutions of the stochastic models exhibit outcomes that are typical of a chronic infection in the natural reservoir or a cytokine storm in human infection. In the chronic infection, occasional flare-ups between high and low responses occur when model parameters are in a region of bistability or periodic solutions. The cytokine storm with a vigorous pro-inflammatory response and less vigorous anti-inflammatory response occurs in the parameter region for a single stable endemic equilibrium with a strong pro-inflammatory response. The results of the model analyses and the simulations are interpreted in terms of the functional role of the cytokines and the inflammatory responses seen in infection of the natural reservoir or of the human host.","publish_time":"2018-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Wenjing; Jang, Sophia; Jonsson, Colleen B; Allen, Linda J S","journal":"Math Med Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99d431d905c498c0627d077c5c3a69bdb729048b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108568.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/imammb/dqy009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29961899/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human infection","vigorous pro-inflammatory response","strong pro-inflammatory response","aggressive pro-inflammatory response","chronic infection","anti-inflammatory responses","human host","vigorous anti-inflammatory response","low responses","cytokine storm","deterministic model","model parameters","model analyses","natural reservoirs","periodic solutions","single stable endemic equilibrium","parameter region","region of bistability","Numerical solutions","component differential equation model","stochastic models account","parameter space","initial high viral load","viral replication","humans results","specific regions","detailed mathematical analysis","occasional flare-ups","avian influenza viruses","zoonotic pathogen","variability","outcomes","tissue","hantaviruses","coronaviruses","cell","course","cytokines","functional role","terms","simulations","contrast","obvious pathology","key difference","levels","extensions","investigation"],"language":"en"},

Objectives The RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit covering 14 respiratory viruses was compared to the RespiFinder Smart22, a broad-spectrum multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) test, targeting 22 viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Study design After verification of its analytical performance, the clinical performance of the RespiFinder Smart22 was evaluated by re-analysis of 96 respiratory samples from oncological patients. Additionally, the time to result (TTR) of both methods was compared. Results The analytical performance of the RespiFinder Smart22 fulfilled all previously specified criteria. Concordant results in both assays were achieved in 74.0% of all clinical specimens and in 91.2% when only positive results were taken into account. The RespiFinder Smart22 yielded additional results in a total of 22 (22.9% of 96) samples due to higher test sensitivity and a broader, highly multiplexed spectrum of pathogens. The TTR of a typical routine test consisting of three samples were 206 and 356min for the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit and the RespiFinder Smart22, respectively. However, hands-on time was reduced by 59.0% applying the MLPA method. Conclusions In our hands, the RespiFinder Smart22 showed excellent analytical performance while hands-on time was halved in comparison to the RT PCR method. Regarding the clinical evaluation, the MLPA method provided additional results in 22.9% (22/96) of specimens due to its comprehensive format, higher test sensitivity and the capability to detect 22 pathogens compared to 14 with the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit.","publish_time":"2014-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berning, Lucia; Aberle, Stephan W.; Simon, Benedikt; Luger, Christoph; Apfalter, Petra; Machherndl-Spandl, Sigrid; Kerschner, Heidrun","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d9ea8d268e89f7b19e3f1782f955933195283e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106480.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.02.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24684925/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214000900; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214000900","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TTR","MLPA","RT PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RespiFinder Smart22","respiratory samples","RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit","respiratory viruses","RT PCR method","bacterial respiratory pathogens","clinical performance","additional results","MLPA method","Concordant results","positive results","excellent analytical performance","higher test sensitivity","hands-on time","clinical specimens","Abstract Background Respiratory tract infections","typical routine test","oncological patients","clinical evaluation","TTR","multiplexed spectrum of pathogens","broad-spectrum multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification","immunosuppressed populations","significant morbidity","re-analysis","mortality","comprehensive format","comparison","Objectives","verification","capability","Study design","specified criteria","total","assays","account","Conclusions","methods"],"language":"en"},

Methods Data encompassing the period from 1991 to 2006 were extracted from the Science Citation Index online version. We analyzed selected documents with \u201Cobstructive sleep apnea\u201D, \u201Cobstructive apnea\u201D, or \u201COSA\u201D as a part of the title, abstract, or key words and reported the following parameters: trends of publication output, journal pattern, country of publication, authorship, author-generated key words, and KeyWords Plus\u00AE. Results The annual number of articles on OSA grew at a faster rate than did the number of general scientific publications, from approximately 200 in 1991 to 650 in 2006.

Patients fed enterally and parenterally at home are exposed to the same risk of infection as the general population, but more prone to complications than others. Therefore the guidance for care-givers and care-takers of these patients is needed. Methods The literature search identified no relevant systematic reviews or studies on the subject. Therefore a panel of 21 experts from 13 home medical nutrition (HMN) centres in Poland was formed. Twenty-three key issues relevant to the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 in the HMN settings were identified and discussed. Some statements diverge from the available nutrition, surgical or ICU guidelines, some are based on the best available experience. Each topic was discussed and assessed during two Delphi rounds subsequently. Statements were graded strong or weak based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Results the panel issued 23 statements, all of them were graded strong. Two scored 85.71% agreement, eleven 95.23%, and ten 100%. The topics were: infection control, enrolment to HMN, logistics and patient information. Conclusions the position paper present pragmatic statements for HMN to be implemented in places without existing protocols for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. They represent the state of knowledge available at the moment and may change should new evidence occurs.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matras, Przemyslaw; Klek, Stanislaw; Folwarski, Marcin; Zmarzly, Anna; Bartoszewska, Lidia; Cebulski, Wlodzimierz; Jakubczyk, Marlena; Kamocki, Zbigniew; Klepczyk, Katarzyna; Kunecki, Marek; Lawi\u0144ski, Michal; Majewska, Krystyna; Matczuk, Maciej; Matysiak-Lusnia, Katarzyna; Sadowski, Maciej; Sobocki, Jacek; Sumlet, Magdalena; Szafranski, Waldemar; Szczepanek, Kinga; Urbanowicz, Krystyna; Zoubek-Wojcik, Agata","journal":"Clin Nutr ESPEN","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65f6f18d2b361271d8ac0472cff12b37c71d5d83.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405457720300929; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2020.05.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405457720300929?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Poland"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","HMN settings","available nutrition","management of SARS","infection control","risk of infection","COVID","Patients","home","panel","state of knowledge available","best available experience","position paper present pragmatic statements","medical nutrition","care-givers","care-takers","Coronavirus Disease","relevant systematic reviews","key issues relevant","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","resource","benefit","balance","enrolment","cost implications","Summary Background","harm","literature search","moment","logistics","Conclusions","general population","equity","studies","illness","ICU guidelines","centres","existing protocols","places","patient information","feasibility","subject","Methods","topics","experts","guidance","Poland","new evidence","complications","cause","pandemic","Delphi rounds","agreement"],"language":"en"},

We report here a rare case of adult-onset KD which revealed to be concurrently infected by Coxsackievirus A4. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 37-year-old Japanese man who presented with fever, exanthema, changes in the peripheral extremities, bilateral non-exudative conjunctival injection, and changes in the oropharynx, signs that meet the diagnostic criteria for KD defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In this case, the patient had a significantly high antibody titer for Coxsackievirus A4, which led us to presume that the occurrence of KD was concurrent Coxsackievirus A4 infection. CONCLUSION: We reported a very rare case of KD which suggests that the disease can be concurrent Coxsackievirus A4 infection. Although KD is an acute childhood disease, with fever as one of the principal features, KD should also be considered in the differential diagnosis when adult patients present with a fever of unknown cause associated with a rash.","publish_time":"2015-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ueda, Yuki; Kenzaka, Tsuneaki; Noda, Ayako; Yamamoto, Yu; Matsumura, Masami","journal":"Int Med Case Rep J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95c40fb092ef550e2c0d8316a3af2d6c025df87d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4599061.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/imcrj.s90685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26491373/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kawasaki","KD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rare case of KD","onset KD","occurrence of KD","concurrent Coxsackievirus A4 infection","rare case of adult","Disease Control","Kawasaki disease","CASE PRESENTATION","changes","fever of unknown cause","acute childhood disease","adult patients","specific cause","peripheral extremities","bilateral non-exudative conjunctival injection","exanthema","Centers","high antibody titer","signs","oropharynx","year-old Japanese man","diagnostic criteria","differential diagnosis","Prevention","infants","principal features","INTRODUCTION","rash","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

While clinical reports from China to date demonstrate that the majority of cases remain relatively mild and recover with supportive care, it is also crucial to be well prepared for severe cases warranting intensive care. Initiating appropriate infection control measures may not always be achievable in primary care or in acute-care settings. CASE: A 45-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe pneumonia, later confirmed as COVID-19. His initial evaluation in the resuscitation room and treatments in the intensive care unit was performed under droplet and contact precaution with additional airborne protection using the N95 respirator mask. He was successfully treated in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory support; and antiretroviral treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. His total intensive care unit stay was 15 days and was discharged on hospital day 24. CONCLUSIONS: Strict infection control precautions are not always an easy task, especially under urgent care in an intensive care unit. However, severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, or another novel infectious disease, could present at any moment and would be a continuing challenge to pursue appropriate measures. We need to be well prepared to secure healthcare workers from exposure to infectious diseases and nosocomial spread, as well as to provide necessary intensive care.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakamura, Kazuha; Hikone, Mayu; Shimizu, Hiroshi; Kuwahara, Yusuke; Tanabe, Maki; Kobayashi, Mioko; Ishida, Takuto; Sugiyama, Kazuhiro; Washino, Takuya; Sakamoto, Naoya; Hamabe, Yuichi","journal":"J Infect Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f2aac377f0db12c8a517905aeca05bc94f2b3f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166031.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2020.03.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X20301124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32317225/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X20301124","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["necessary intensive care","urgent care","primary care","supportive care","total intensive care unit stay","acute-care settings","severe cases of COVID","severe pneumonia","novel coronavirus disease","novel infectious disease","appropriate infection control measures","majority of cases","appropriate measures","infectious diseases","Strict infection control precautions","additional airborne protection","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","mechanical ventilation","respiratory support","exposure","droplet","days","treatments","antiretroviral treatment","contact precaution","resuscitation room","date","healthcare workers","ongoing outbreak","N95 respirator mask","easy task","China","lopinavir","nosocomial spread","continuing challenge","CONCLUSIONS","initial evaluation","year-old man","clinical reports","ritonavir","moment","hospital day","INTRODUCTION","global threat"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetic analysis showed that FRCoV-NL-2010 is most closely related to mink CoV, forming a separate clade of mustelid alphacoronavirus that split off early from other alphacoronaviruses. Based on sequence homology of the complete genome, we propose that these mustelid coronaviruses may be assigned to a new species.

Comparison with genotype-specific gel-based RT-PCR assays revealed that the fluorogenic assays were more sensitive and more rapid than conventional amplifications, with a large increase in throughput. The genotype-specific fluorogenic assays were then used to detect and measure viral loads in the faecal samples collected from dogs naturally or experimentally infected with type I, type II, or both genotypes. Of 174 samples collected from naturally infected dogs, 77 were positive for CCoV type I and 46 for CCoV type II. Thirty-eight dogs were found to be infected naturally by both genotypes, with viral RNA titres generally higher for type I in comparison to type II. At the same time, dogs infected experimentally shed type I RNA with higher titres with respect to type II.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Decaro, Nicola; Martella, Vito; Ricci, Dominga; Elia, Gabriella; Desario, Costantina; Campolo, Marco; Cavaliere, Nicola; Di Trani, Livia; Tempesta, Maria; Buonavoglia, Canio","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c716084ad4b602a13ab7e5c89a3d9adc28c6eafc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112928.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093405001989; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093405001989","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shed type","precise quantitation of CCoV type","infected dogs","genotype-specific fluorogenic assays","genotype-specific fluorogenic RT-PCR assays","viral RNA titres","faeces of dogs","genotype-specific gel-based RT-PCR assays","copies of standard RNA","higher titres","Comparison","genotypes","viral loads","faecal samples","quantitation of canine coronavirus","sensitivity","conventional amplifications","reproducibility","high specificity","detection","linear range","large increase","respect","orders of magnitude","time","throughput","diarrhoea"],"language":"en"},

In Taiwan, the influenza rapid test, an in vitro diagnostic device (Flu-IVD), only requires documented reviews for market approval by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. The purpose of this study was to investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of Flu-IVDs used in Taiwan. Analytical sensitivity and specificity tests were performed for influenza antigens A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) virus, A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2) virus, B/Brisbane/60/08 virus, and human coronavirus OC43. A total of seven domestic and 31 imported Flu-IVD samples were collected, of which, 20 samples had inadequate labeling, including those with removed package inserts or incorrect insert information. The analytical sensitivity of Flu-IVDs for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and Flu B was 500\u20131000 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, and 1000 ng/mL, respectively. For the 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID50) label, the average A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 sensitivity for Flu-IVDs was log10 5.8 \u00B1 0.5 and log10 6.6 \u00B1 0.5 CCID50/mL, respectively. As to the specificity test, no product cross-reacted with human coronavirus OC43.

E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) is widely acknowledged as a highly effective solubilizing agent. In this chapter, we describe how to construct either a His(6)- or a dual His(6)-MBP tagged fusion protein by Gateway(\u00AE) recombinational cloning and how to evaluate their yield and solubility. We also describe a simple and rapid procedure to test the solubility of proteins after removing their N-terminal fusion tags by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease digestion. The choice of whether to use a His(6) tag or a His(6)-MBP tag can be made on the basis of this solubility test.","publish_time":"2017-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raran-Kurussi, Sreejith; Waugh, David S.","journal":"Protein Crystallography","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf0ffddc25c8df226463f30630c8572c0705d0f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122414.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28573567/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-7000-1_1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion protein","protein purification","solubility of proteins","coli maltose-binding protein","MBP tag","solubility test","aggregation-prone protein","Escherichia coli","production of recombinant proteins","insolubility of recombinant proteins","N-terminal fusion tags","rapid procedure","Rapid advances","persistent problem","Affinity-based methods","virus","tobacco","peptide","biotechnology","TEV","Gateway","bioengineering","protease digestion","decades","recombinational cloning","soluble partner","basis","effective solubilizing agent","progress","yield","chapter","choice"],"language":"en"},

Japanese horse chestnut (seed of Aesculus turbinata) contains many saponin mixtures, called escins, and has been used for a long time as a traditional medicinal plant. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on escins have revealed that acylations at C-21 and C-22 with angeloyl or tigloyl groups were important for their cytotoxic effects. However, the strong cytotoxicity of escins makes them hard to utilize for other diseases and to develop as nutraceuticals. In this research, we investigated whether escin derivatives 1\u20137 (including new compounds 2, 3, 5 and 6), without the angeloyl or tigloyl groups and with modified glycosidic linkages by hydrolysis, have PEDV inhibitory effects with less cytotoxicity. Compounds 1\u20137 had no cytotoxicity at 20\u03BCM on VERO cells, while compounds 8\u201310 showed strong cytotoxicity at similar concentrations on PEDV.

This is particularly true for on-site testing. Here, a smartphone-based reader was designed and 3D-printed for quantitatively assess AuNPs-LFIS. The basic principle of the devise was relying on a smartphone\u2019s ambient light sensor (SPALS).

To validate this approach, our newly developed smartphone\u2019s ambient light sensor-based reader (SPALS-reader) was used to readout AuNPs-LFIS of three analytical targets: cadmium ion (Cd2\u002B; limit of detection (LOD) was 0.16 ng/mL), clenbuterol (CL; LOD was 0.046 ng/mL), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV; LOD was 0.055 \u03BCg/mL). The result showed good consistency with the results of conventional image analysis approaches, indicating that the smartphone-based device is appropriate for use in AuNPs-LFIS readouts.

Both viruses cause diseases associated with high mortality rates, resulting in dramatic economic losses in the aquaculture industry. There are currently no effective treatments for either of these two viral diseases. Thus, early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis plays a fundamental role in disease prevention and control in aquaculture. Traditional methods of diagnosis, such as virus culture, enzyme-linked immunoassay, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are either time consuming or require sophisticated temperature control devices. In this study, one sets of specific primers and probes were designed for the real-time quantitative recombinase polymerase amplification (qRPA) detection of AbHV and RGNNV separately. The sensitivity and specificity of detection were evaluated by comparison with detection by conventional PCR and quantitative PCR. The optimal reaction temperature and time for virus detection is 37\u00B0C for 20min. The detection limit is 100 copies per reaction, making this approach faster and more sensitive than qPCR in this study. In a field application, the detection percentage of qRPA was higher than that of qPCR for both AbHV and NNV. Additionally, good correlation was found between qRPA and qPCR detection (R2 \u003E0.8).

In order to better understand such multiscale interactions, we have implemented a systems immunology approach focusing on the analysis of the structure, dynamics and operating principles of virus-host interactions which constrain the initial spread of the pathogen. Using high-resolution experimental data sets coming from the well-described mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) model, we first calibrated basic modules including MHV infection of its primary target cells, i.e. pDCs and macrophages (M\u03C6s). These basic building blocks were used to generate and validate an integrative mathematical model for in vivo infection dynamics. Parameter estimation for the system indicated that on a per capita basis, one infected pDC secretes sufficient type I IFN to protect 10(3) to 10(4) M\u03C6s from cytopathic viral infection. This extremely high protective capacity of pDCs secures the spleen\u0027s capability to function as a \u2018sink\u2019 for the virus produced in peripheral organs such as the liver. Furthermore, our results suggest that the pDC population in spleen ensures a robust protection against virus variants which substantially down-modulate IFN secretion. However, the ability of pDCs to protect against severe disease caused by virus variants exhibiting an enhanced liver tropism and higher replication rates appears to be rather limited. Taken together, this systems immunology analysis suggests that antiviral therapy against cytopathic viruses should primarily limit viral replication within peripheral target organs.","publish_time":"2010-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bocharov, Gennady; Z\u00FCst, Roland; Cervantes-Barragan, Luisa; Luzyanina, Tatyana; Chiglintsev, Egor; Chereshnev, Valery A.; Thiel, Volker; Ludewig, Burkhard","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/00cf719db65d07c0c7bdea9defaea448fc5f5786.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2908624.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1001017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20661432/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytopathic virus infection","virus variants","MHV infection","cytopathic viral infection","infection dynamics","operating principles of virus","well-described mouse hepatitis virus","cytopathic viruses","viral replication","infected pDC","pDC population","systems immunology analysis","peripheral target organs","ability of pDCs","peripheral organs","M\u03C6s","systems immunology approach","mediated protection","robust protection","host interactions","tissue-scale","high protective capacity of pDCs","multiscale interactions","IFN secretion","higher replication rates","enhanced liver tropism","primary target cells","calibrated basic modules","integrative mathematical model","organism-scale events","basic building blocks","antiviral therapy","high-resolution experimental data sets","sufficient type","severe disease","initial spread","spleen\u0027s capability","basis","Plasmacytoid dendritic cell","structure","macrophages","Parameter estimation","pathogen","order","results","sink"],"language":"en"},

The virulence factors of these bacteria include: (i) the secretion of proteins (i.e. EspB) involved in microvilli effacement, (ii) the production of the intimin, a 94kDa outer membrane protein encoded by the eaeA gene and involved in the intimate attachment of bacteria to epithelial cell and (iii) the production of verotoxins: VT1 and/or VT2. We investigated the presence and the pathotype of these strains in several calf populations by colony hybridization or by genetic amplification. Using the colony hybridization method we showed first that only 5% of calves who died from diarrhea presented EaeA\u002B E. coli strains and secondly that 19% of healthy calves showed an asymptomatic carriage. However, using colony hybridization and genetic amplification, we identified EaeA\u002B strains in 91% of calves living in farms with recurrent diarrhea problems. In 66% of the calves, there was a correlation between the presence of AEEC and diarrhea. At the pathotype level, most of the EaeA\u002B isolates were negative for VT probes. In VT\u002B bacteria, the majority were VT1\u002B. The number of VT positive bacteria was significantly higher in calves who died from diarrhea than in healthy or sick calves. This underlined the aggravating role of verotoxins in the disease. Moreover, only 25% of the bovine AEEC were positive with the EaeB probe. Surprisingly, the proportion of EaeB\u002B strains was significantly higher in healthy calves than in other populations.","publish_time":"1998-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"China, B; Pirson, V; Mainil, J","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d428278d779b0b1b42cbd563ae809278e4f3607f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117297.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113598002375; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113598002375","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AEEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthy calves","sick calves","week old calves","coli strains","eaeA gene","number of VT positive bacteria","recurrent diarrhea problems","colony hybridization method","intimate attachment of bacteria","genetic amplification","presence of AEEC","production of verotoxins","VT probes","VT1","calf populations","EaeB probe","bovine AEEC","proportion of EaeB","pathotype level","effacing Escherichia coli","aggravating role of verotoxins","kDa outer membrane protein","epithelial cell","EspB","intimin","Abstract Attaching","farms","disease","isolates","asymptomatic carriage","majority","correlation","microvilli effacement","secretion of proteins","virulence factors","VT2"],"language":"en"},

Methods Investigators performed a chart and laboratory review for neonates with a diagnosis of NEC during January 1, 2007, to February 13, 2007, to identify risk factors. Enhanced environmental cleaning, cohorting of infants and nurses, and increased attention to hand hygiene were instituted.

We have purified, sequenced and determined the structures of two new P-III SVMPs \u2013 atragin and kaouthiagin-like (K-like) from Naja atra. Atragin exhibits a known C-shaped topology, whereas K-like adopts an I-shaped conformation because of the distinct disulfide pattern in the disintegrin-like (D) domain. K-like exhibits an enzymatic specificity toward pro-TNF\u03B1 with less inhibition of cell migration, but atragin shows the opposite effect. The specificity of the enzymatic activity is indicated to be dominated mainly by the local structures of SVMP in the metalloprotease (M) domain, whereas the hyper-variable region (HVR) in the cysteine-rich (C) domain is involved in a cell-migration activity. We demonstrate also a pH-dependent enzymatic activity of atragin that we correlate with the structural dynamics of a Zn2\u002B-binding motif and the Met-turn based on the structures determined with a pH-jump method.

Natural infection by ECoV has been reported in adult horses worldwide, whereas experimental infection has only been reported in juvenile horses. An experimental infection model is needed to study the clinical presentation, laboratory abnormalities, and pathophysiological changes associated with ECoV. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical, hematologic, molecular, and serological features of adult horses experimentally infected with ECoV. ANIMALS: Eight adult horses. METHODS: Four horses were intragastrically infected with fecal material containing 10(9) genome equivalents of ECoV. Four additional horses were exposed daily to the feces from the experimentally\u2010infected horses. Monitoring included physical examinations, as well as daily nasal swab, whole blood, and fecal collection for molecular detection of ECoV. Blood was collected every other day for hematologic analysis and weekly for serologic analysis. RESULTS: All 8 horses shed ECoV in feces. Six of the 8 horses (75%) exhibited mild, clinical disease with soft, formed manure; 1 horse exhibited transient pyrexia. All horses maintained total white cell counts within normal limits, but 3 horses developed transient lymphopenia. No statistically significant differences (P = .20) were observed in quantity of fecal shedding of ECoV between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Experimental infection of adult horses with ECoV was associated with mild and self\u2010limiting clinical signs, transient lymphopenia, and fecal shedding of ECoV, which mimics natural infection. No differences between experimentally\u2010infected horses and horses exposed to ECoV\u2010containing feces were identified. Results of our study support a fecal\u2010oral route of transmission.","publish_time":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schaefer, Emily; Harms, Corey; Viner, Molly; Barnum, Samantha; Pusterla, Nicola","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a0058a8f5c282059a2cc172807b09340161ae77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6271284.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.15318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30353949/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected horses","juvenile horses","additional horses","Experimental infection of adult horses","enteric disease of adult horses","serological features of adult horses","quantity of fecal shedding of ECoV","molecular detection of ECoV","genome equivalents of ECoV","clinical disease","Natural infection","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","fecal collection","fecal material","clinical presentation","experimental infection model","feces","transient lymphopenia","self\u2010limiting clinical signs","hematologic analysis","transient pyrexia","blood","study","RESULTS","serologic analysis","significant differences","daily nasal swab","formed manure","normal limits","laboratory abnormalities","total white cell","pathophysiological changes","day","CONCLUSIONS","oral route of transmission","physical examinations","BACKGROUND","Equine coronavirus","METHODS","Monitoring","groups","ANIMALS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

The Z-curve theory is a geometrical approach to genome analysis. The Z-curve is a three-dimensional curve that represents a given DNA sequence in the sense that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other. The Z-curve, therefore, contains all the information that the corresponding DNA sequence carries. The analysis of a DNA sequence can then be performed through studying the corresponding Z-curve. The Z-curve method has found applications in a wide range of areas in the past two decades, including the identifications of protein-coding genes, replication origins, horizontally-transferred genomic islands, promoters, translational start sides and isochores, as well as studies on phylogenetics, genome visualization and comparative genomics.

A rapid point-of-care test is needed to allow more widespread mobile detection of the virus directly from patient material. In this study, we describe the development of a reverse transcription isothermal Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the identification of MERS-CoV.

The isothermal (42\u00B0C) MERS-CoV RT-RPA was as sensitive as real-time RT-PCR (10 RNA molecules), rapid (3-7 minutes) and mobile (using tubescanner weighing 1kg). The MERS-CoV RT-RPA showed cross-detection neither of any of the RNAs of several coronaviruses and respiratory viruses affecting humans nor of the human genome. The developed isothermal real-time RT-RPA is ideal for rapid mobile molecular MERS-CoV monitoring in acute patients and may also facilitate the search for the animal reservoir of MERS-CoV.","publish_time":"2013-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abd El Wahed, Ahmed; Patel, Pranav; Heidenreich, Doris; Hufert, Frank T.; Weidmann, Manfred","journal":"PLoS Curr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3871419.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.outbreaks.62df1c7c75ffc96cd59034531e2e8364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459611/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Europe"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV RT-RPA","detection of MERS","identification of MERS","rapid mobile molecular MERS-CoV monitoring","real-time RT-PCR","developed isothermal real-time RT-RPA","animal reservoir of MERS","partial nucleocapsid gene RNA molecular standard of MERS","widespread mobile detection","rapid point","patient samples","cross-detection","respiratory viruses","RNA molecules","imported cases","patient material","suspected cases","assay sensitivity","reverse transcription isothermal Recombinase Polymerase Amplification","emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","Europe","humans","development","acute patients","public health authorities","coronaviruses","RNAs","search","care test","minutes","human genome","centralized laboratories","screening","tubescanner","study"],"language":"en"},

When such an outbreak occurs, an accurate estimate of the transmissibility of the responsible pathogen is essential for an appropriate response to future outbreaks. Transmissibility is usually characterised in terms of the reproduction number, R, which is the mean number of new cases of infection produced by a single infectious individual. A subcritical reproduction number (R \u003C 1) guarantees that an outbreak will eventually die out of its own accord. By contrast, a supercritical reproduction number (R \u003E 1) does not guarantee spread of the disease, since even with appreciable transmissibility, an outbreak may become extinct due to stochastic effects associated with a small number of infected individuals. Once the number of infectious individuals is conditioned on extinction, we show that an exact symmetry of the underlying theory ensures two distinct values of R, one larger than unity, the other smaller than unity, for which all outbreak properties are identical, with no signature of difference. Therefore a disease with a subcritical R, or its supercritical counterpart, when conditioned on extinction, have, for a given outbreak, identical individual likelihoods. In the full likelihood, this symmetry is lost, since the individual likelihood for a subcritical R is weighted by an extinction probability of unity, but the individual likelihood of a supercritical R is weighted by a sub-unity extinction probability. However, the inference can still benefit from the underlying symmetry, since it yields a mapping of all supercritical reproduction numbers onto the subcritical domain (R \u003C 1), thereby speeding up evaluation of the likelihood profile. The symmetry holds in the standard situation, where the distribution of secondary cases is Poisson, as well as where this distribution has a negative binomial form and super-spreading can occur.","publish_time":"2019-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waxman, David; Nouvellet, Pierre","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6acbf26529c47f0c368f3f8016e134d92bd024c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6408326.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30711456/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519319300505; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519319300505; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.01.033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subcritical reproduction number","given outbreak","outbreak properties","distinct values of R","extinction probability of unity","number of infectious individuals","supercritical reproduction numbers","underlying symmetry","disease","sub-unity extinction probability","outbreak of limited size","supercritical counterpart","subcritical domain","small number of infected individuals","appreciable transmissibility","exact symmetry","likelihood profile","identical individual likelihoods","single infectious individual","mean number of new cases of infection","distribution of secondary cases","underlying theory","appropriate response","negative binomial form","responsible pathogen","observation","stochastic effects","super-spreading","mapping","terms","future outbreaks","standard situation","accurate estimate","Poisson","contrast","signature of difference","evaluation","inference","work","accord"],"language":"en"},

However, co-detection of multiple agents and bacterial colonization make it difficult to distinguish between asymptomatic infection or illness aetiology. We assessed whether semi-quantitative microbial load data can differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic states for common respiratory pathogens. METHODS: We obtained throat and nasal swab samples from military trainees at two Thai Army barracks. Specimens were collected at the start and end of 10-week training periods (non-acute samples), and from individuals who developed upper respiratory tract infection during training (acute samples). We analysed the samples using a commercial multiplex respiratory panel comprising 33 bacterial, viral and fungal targets. We used random effects tobit models to compare cycle threshold (Ct) value distributions from non-acute and acute samples. RESULTS: We analysed 341 non-acute and 145 acute swab samples from 274 participants. Haemophilus influenzae type B was the most commonly detected microbe (77.4% of non-acute and 64.8% of acute samples). In acute samples, nine specific microbe pairs were detected more frequently than expected by chance. Regression models indicated significantly lower microbial load in non-acute relative to acute samples for H. influenzae non-type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae and rhinovirus, although it was not possible to identify a Ct-value threshold indicating causal etiology for any of these organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-quantitative measures of microbial concentration did not reliably differentiate between illness and asymptomatic colonization, suggesting that clinical symptoms may not always be directly related to microbial load for common respiratory infections.

It is produced at sites of infection and inflammation by both structural and inflammatory cells. However, its role in allergen-induced inflammation remains to be tested. Objective We sought to determine the effect of Ptx3 deletion on ovalbumin (OVA)\u2013induced allergic inflammation in a murine model of asthma. Methods Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected from patients with severe asthma and healthy subjects, and the level of PTX3 was determined by using ELISA. Ptx3 \u002B/\u002B and Ptx3 \u2212/\u2212 mice were sensitized and challenged with OVA and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and the lungs were collected for assessing inflammation. Lung tissue inflammation and mucus production were assessed by means of flow cytometry and hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff staining, respectively. flexiVent was used to determine airway resistance to methacholine in these mice. Results Here we report that mice with severe asthma and OVA-sensitized/challenged mice had increased PTX3 levels in the lungs compared with healthy control mice. Mice lacking PTX3 have exaggerated neutrophilic/eosinophilic lung inflammation, mucus production, and airway hyperresponsiveness in an experimental model of OVA-induced asthma. Furthermore, OVA-exposed lung Ptx3 \u2212/\u2212 CD4 T cells exhibit an increased production of IL-17A, an effect that is accompanied by an increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation, reduced IL-2 production, and enhanced activation and survival. Also, we observed an increase in numbers of IL-6\u2013 and IL-23\u2013producing dendritic cells in OVA-exposed Ptx3 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with those in wild-type control mice. Conclusion Altogether, PTX3 deficiency results in augmented airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus production, and IL-17A\u2013dominant pulmonary inflammation, suggesting a regulatory role of PTX3 in the development of allergic inflammation.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Balhara, Jyoti; Shan, Lianyu; Zhang, Jingbo; Muhuri, Anik; Halayko, Andrew J.; Almiski, Muhamad S.; Doeing, Diana; McConville, John; Matzuk, Martin M.; Gounni, Abdelilah S.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7660d619aa4d7f9945ad55d443b2eef4c34f7b0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6317853.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2016.04.063; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674916307023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27567326/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674916307023; http://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091674916307023/pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background Pentraxin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OVA-exposed Ptx3","level of PTX3","OVA-exposed lung Ptx3","regulatory role of PTX3","increased PTX3 levels","PTX3 deficiency results","effect of Ptx3 deletion","increased production of IL","mucus production","eosinophilic lung inflammation","Lung tissue inflammation","allergen-induced inflammation","healthy control mice","development of allergic inflammation","induced asthma","dominant pulmonary inflammation","experimental model of OVA","reduced IL","numbers of IL","severe asthma","wild-type control mice","murine model of asthma","augmented airway hyperresponsiveness","airway resistance","lungs","nonredundant role","dendritic cells","inflammatory cells","Methods Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","CD4 T cells","increased signal transducer","healthy subjects","immune system","patients","female fertility","activator of transcription","matrix deposition","pathogen clearance","phosphorylation","hematoxylin","crossroads","periodic acid-Schiff staining","ovalbumin","flow cytometry","multifunctional molecule","vascular biology","enhanced activation","survival","Conclusion","methacholine","sites of infection","flexiVent","Background Pentraxin","Objective","ELISA"],"language":"en"},

This supplement provides suggestions for all of those involved in a disaster or pandemic with multiple critically ill patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, professional societies, and public health or government officials. The current Task Force included a total of 100 participants from nine countries, comprised of clinicians and experts from a wide variety of disciplines. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted to identify studies upon which evidence-based recommendations could be made. No studies of sufficient quality were identified. Therefore, the panel developed expert-opinion-based suggestions that are presented in this supplement using a modified Delphi process. The ultimate aim of the supplement is to expand the focus beyond the walls of ICUs to provide recommendations for the management of all critically ill or injured adults and children resulting from a pandemic or disaster wherever that care may be provided. Considerations for the management of critically ill patients include clinical priorities and logistics (supplies, evacuation, and triage) as well as the key enablers (systems planning, business continuity, legal framework, and ethical considerations) that facilitate the provision of this care. The supplement also aims to illustrate how the concepts of mass critical care are integrated across the spectrum of surge events from conventional through contingency to crisis standards of care.","publish_time":"2016-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Christian, Michael D.; Devereaux, Asha V.; Dichter, Jeffrey R.; Rubinson, Lewis; Kissoon, Niranjan","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094437/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Task Force"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["supplement","ill patients","injured patients","management","crisis standards of care","based suggestions","concepts of mass critical care","evidence-based recommendations","front-line clinicians","injured adults","ethical considerations","studies of sufficient quality","professional societies","business continuity","contingency","hospital administrators","logistics","clinical priorities","terrorism attacks","industrial accidents","public health","legal framework","total","systems","supplies","experts","children","spectrum of surge events","Natural disasters","large numbers","key enablers","pandemics","evacuation","countries","expert-opinion","wide variety of disciplines","government officials","walls of ICUs","current Task Force","triage","participants","capacity","panel","modified Delphi process","focus","provision","Comprehensive literature searches","ultimate aim"],"language":"en"},

Design and setting: Observational study in a tertiary referral center, Intensive Care Unit, Astrid Lindgren Children\u0027s Hospital at Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Subjects and methods: Seventeen adult patients with ARDS were treated with venovenous or venoarterial ECMO after failure of conventional therapy. The Murray score of pulmonary injury averaged 3.5 (3.0\u20134.0) and the mean PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was 46 (31\u201365). A standard ECMO circuit with nonheparinized surfaces was used. The patients were minimally sedated and received pressure-supported ventilation. High inspiratory pressures were avoided and arterial saturation as low as 70% was accepted on venovenous bypass. Results: In one patient a stable bypass could not be established. Among the remaining 16 patients 13 survived (total survival rate 76%) after 3\u201352 days (mean 15) on bypass. Major surgical procedures were performed in several patients. The cause of death in the three nonsurvivors was intracranial complications leading to total cerebral infarction. Conclusion: A high survival rate can be obtained in adult patients with severe ARDS using ECMO and pressure-supported ventilation with minimal sedation. Surgical complications are amenable to surgical treatment during ECMO. Bleeding problems can generally be controlled but require immediate and aggressive approach. It is difficult or impossible to decide when a lung disease is irreversible, and prolonged ECMO treatment may be successful even in the absence of any detectable lung function.","publish_time":"2000-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lind\u00E9n, Viveka; Palm\u00E9r, Kenneth; Reinhard, Jarl; Westman, Reino; Ehr\u00E9n, Henrik; Granholm, Tina; Frenckner, Bj\u00F6rn","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/914b6e8d62a6e5ecec5f58a344365f99edff643f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094942/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzUxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Murray"],"organizations":["Intensive Care Unit","Astrid Lindgren Children","ARDS","ECMO"],"locations":["Stockholm","Sweden"],"keyphrases":["venoarterial ECMO","adult patients","prolonged ECMO treatment","surgical treatment","ventilation","standard ECMO circuit","severe ARDS","results of treatment","Surgical complications","venovenous bypass","total survival rate","minimal sedation","high survival rate","stable bypass","Major surgical procedures","Karolinska Hospital","intracranial complications","lung disease","mean PaO","total cerebral infarction","High inspiratory pressures","detectable lung function","Astrid Lindgren Children\u0027s Hospital","severe acute respiratory distress syndrome","Intensive Care Unit","tertiary referral center","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","Observational study","nonsurvivors","Stockholm","arterial saturation","failure of conventional therapy","absence","nonheparinized surfaces","methods","Murray score of pulmonary injury","FIO","Sweden","Conclusion","Subjects","cause of death","aggressive approach","Design","Bleeding problems","Objectives","days"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Single-center study with 19 patients, followed by a multicenter randomized comparison of surfactant with a standardized treatment algorithm. Primary endpoint PaO(2)/FIO(2) at 48 h, secondary endpoints: PaO(2)/FIO(2) at 2, 4, 12, and 24 h, survival, survival without rescue, days on ventilator, subgroups analyzed by analysis of variance to identify patients who might benefit from surfactant SETTING: Multicenter study in 19 reference centers for ARDS. PATIENTS: Children after the 44th postconceptional week and under 14 years old, admitted for at least 4 h, ventilated for 12\u2013120 h, and without heart failure or chronic lung disease. In the multicenter study 35 patients were recruited; 20 were randomized to the surfactant group and 15 to the nonsurfactant group. Decreasing recruitment of patients led to a preliminary end of this study. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of 100 mg/kg bovine surfactant intratracheally under continuous ventilation and PEEP, as soon as the PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio dropped to less than 100 for 2 h (in the pilot study increments of 50 mg/kg as long as the PaO(2)/FIO(2) did not increase by 20%). A second equivalent dose within 48 h was permitted. RESULTS: In the pilot study the PaO(2)/FIO(2) increased by a mean of 100 at 48 h (n=19). A higher PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio was observed in the surfactant group 2 h after the first dose (58 from baseline vs. 9), at 48 h there was a trend towards a higher ratio (38 from baseline vs. 22). The rate of rescue therapy was significantly lower in the surfactant group. Outcome criteria were not affected by a second surfactant dose (n=11). A significant difference in PaO(2)/FIO(2) in favor of surfactant at 48 h was found in the subgroup with an initial PaO(2)/FIO(2) ratio higher than 65 and in patients without pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Surfactant therapy in severe ARDS improves oxygenation immediately after administration.

Pneumonia was defined as two or more respiratory symptoms and signs and an opacity on a chest radiograph as interpreted by the attending physician RESULTS: A total of 3,043 patients were enrolled in the study, 246 of whom died (8.1%). On multivariate analysis, increasing pneumonia severity score, increasing age, site of care, consultation with a respirologist or infectious diseases physician, and functional status at the time of admission were all independently predictive of mortality. Increasing pneumonia severity risk score, increasing age, site of hospitalization, functional status, and consultation with an infectious diseases physician or a respirologist were independently associated with both early (\u003C 5 days) and late (\u2265 5 days) mortality. In contrast, partial or complete use of the pneumonia pathway was associated with decreased early mortality, but had no effect on late mortality. A low lymphocyte count and a high serum potassium level were associated with early but not with late mortality. The type of antibiotic therapy had an effect on late but not on early mortality CONCLUSIONS: Functional status at the time of hospital admission is a powerful predictor of mortality and should be incorporated into any scores or models that are used to predict mortality. While there are some common predictors of early and late in-hospital mortality, early mortality is not affected by the timing or type of antibiotic therapy, whereas late mortality is influenced by the type of antibiotic therapy.

Hospital outcome details were available on 583 patients in the series. The mean Apache II scores for survivors (396) and non-survivors (187) were 13 (SD 7) and 24 (SD 9), and their Risk of Death were 16 (SD 16) and 47 (SD 27) respectively (p(0.001 for both). The majority of deaths (75%: 141/187) in our series came from those with chronic ill health (55%: 103/187), of whom 37% (38/103) were in endstage disease, and those with \u201Cold\u201D trauma (18%: 34/187) often with incipient sepsis transferred from other hospitals after a mean delay of 9 days. Our higher than predicted mortality (mortality ratio 1.2) in comparison with centres in the United States of America (US) may be partly explained by the high proportion of our population from these unfavourable groups, by our use of the best Glasgow Coma Scale in the first 24 h following admission, and the major differences between our patient population and that of the US upon which the Apache II was based. The presence of these large unfavourable groups indicates a change in our admission policy is warranted.","publish_time":"1988-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacobs, S.; Chang, R. W.

We sought to determine whether bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with lung injury contained mediators that would activate procollagen I promoter and if this activation predicted important clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective controlled study of ALI/ARDS. SETTING: Intensive care units and laboratory of a university hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Acute lung injury/ARDS, cardiogenic edema (negative controls) and pulmonary fibrosis (positive controls) patients. INTERVENTIONS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected within 48 h of intubation from ALI/ARDS patients. BALF was also collected from patients with pulmonary fibrosis and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Human lung fibroblasts were transfected with a procollagen I promoter-luciferase construct and incubated with BALF; procollagen I promoter activity was then measured. BALF active TGF-\u03B21 levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Twenty-nine ARDS patients, nine negative and six positive controls were enrolled. BALF from ARDS patients induced 41% greater procollagen I promoter activation than that from negative controls (p\u003C0.05) and a TGF-\u03B21 blocking antibody significantly reduced this activation in ARDS patients. There was a trend toward higher TGF-\u03B21 levels in the ARDS group compared to negative controls (\u22121.056 log(10)\u00B10.1415 vs \u22121.505 log(10)\u00B10.1425) (p\u003C0.09). Procollagen I promoter activation was not associated with mortality; however, lower TGF-\u03B21 levels were associated with more ventilator-free and ICU-free days. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from ALI/ARDS patients activates procollagen I promoter, which is due partly to TGF-\u03B21. Activated TGF-\u03B21 may impact ARDS outcome independent of its effect on procollagen I activation.

New findings contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis and lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. The innate immune system, being responsible for the first response to infections, can trigger adaptive immune responses in case the initial response is ineffective. Both arms of the immune system interact with each other, mainly via cell-cell-interactions but also by soluble factors, such as cytokines and chemokines. Two sub-populations of helper T-cells direct both balanced activation and inhibition of the two arms of the immune systems using specific patterns of cytokine release. Results obtained in new animal models of sepsis, taking a progressive growth of bacteria into account, have implied that existing knowledge has to be reanalyzed. The idea of sepsis as a mere \u201Cover-reaction to inflammation\u201D has to be abandoned. Various so-called pattern recognition receptors (e.g. toll-like receptors, TLRs, NOD proteins) are located intracellularly or in the plasma membrane of innate immune cells and recognize certain patterns expressed exclusively by extracellular pathogens. Upon receptor engagement, intracellular signaling pathways lead to cellular activation, followed by release of various cytokines and anti-microbial substances. During the course of sepsis a cytokine shift towards increasing immune suppression occurs. The innate immune system also contributes to the migration of leukocytes in inflammed tissue, involving chemokines and adhesion molecules. Leukocytes also secrete the tissue factor leading to formation of thrombin. The environment in sepsis can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but at the same time thrombin triggers the release of chemokines and adhesion molecules through endothelial cells, which represents a positive feedback mechanism for innate immune responses. New therapeutic strategies for sepsis try to establish a well-balanced immune response. Intervention is accomplished through inhibition of inflammatory cytokines, their receptors or through activation of immunostimulatory responses.","publish_time":"2004-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u00F6rner, C.; Bouchon, A.; Bierhaus, A.; Nawroth, P.

This article gives a critical overview of currently used as well as investigational biomarkers, tests and scores in general, and shows some examples of the implications for common diseases, clinical situations and constellations in the intensive care unit.","publish_time":"2012-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lehner, G.F.; Pechlaner, C.; Graziadei, I.W.; Joannidis, M.","journal":"Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/154d4c035c09f66ce4054d919398b0e64a361907.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095894.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095894/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzcyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["scores available","better monitoring","organs","intensive care unit","Monitoring of organ function","various monitoring devices","investigational biomarkers","useful parameters","specific biomarkers","core tasks of intensive care medicine","constellations","clinical situations","common diseases","liver","kidneys","gastrointestinal tract","implications","examples","tests","blood coagulation","article","critical overview","combinations"],"language":"en"},

It is known to cleave small peptides, such as angiotensin I and bradykinin and changes their biological activities, leading to upregulation of blood pressure. Here we describe a new activity for ACE: a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein releasing activity (GPIase activity). Unlike its peptidase activity, GPIase activity is weakly inhibited by the tightly binding ACE inhibitor and not inactivated by substitutions of core amino acid residues for the peptidase activity, suggesting that the active site elements for GPIase differ from those for peptidase activity. ACE shed various GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface, and the process was accelerated by the lipid raft disruptor filipin. The released products carried portions of the GPI anchor, indicating cleavage within the GPI moiety. Further analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry predicted the cleavage site at the mannose-mannose linkage. GPI-anchored proteins such as TESP5 and PH-20 were released from the sperm membrane of wild-type mice but not in Ace knockout sperm in vivo. Moreover, peptidase-inactivated E414D mutant ACE and also PI-PLC rescued the egg-binding deficiency of Ace knockout sperms, implying that ACE plays a crucial role in fertilization through this activity.

The open-reading frame (ORF) of EhV99B1-SPT encoded a protein of 496 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 96 kDa and Ip 6.01. The results of sequence analysis showed that there was about 31%\u201345% identity in amino acid sequence with other organisms. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree suggested that the EhV99B1-SPT gene possibly horizontally transferred from the eukaryote. Hydrophobic profiles of deduced amino acid sequences suggested a hydrophobic, globular and membrane-associated protein with five transmembrane domains (TMDs) motifs. Several potential N-linked glycosylation sites were presented in SPT. These results suggested that EhV99B1-SPT was an integral endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein. Despite lower sequence identity, the secondary and three-dimensional structures predicted showed that the \u201Cpocket\u201D structure element composed of 2\u03B1-helices and 4\u03B2-sheets was the catalytic center of this enzyme, with a typical conserved \u201CTFTKSFG\u201D active site in the N-terminal region and was very close to those of prokaryotic organisms.

This \u201Cchimera\u201D was highly similar to the prokaryotic homologous SPT.

Although important challenges remain for in vivo applications, the first clinical trials with targeted vectors have already begun to take place.","publish_time":"2007-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waehler, Reinhard; Russell, Stephen J.; Curiel, David T.","journal":"Nat Rev Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85c351c1a3c81bb14076c075be4c774809370072.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097627/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2Ozg4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["targeted vectors","non-target cells","high transduction efficiency of viral vectors","great potential of gene therapy","capable of transducing target cells","therapeutic success","therapeutic need","lack of appropriate targeting","partial exploitation","impact","transfer vehicles","diverse techniques","applications","clinical trials","tropism","Substantial progress","past","cell types","important challenges","place"],"language":"en"},

Although this zoonosis is generally not considered as fatal, the pathogen can eventually cause severe infection with septic shock, multi-organ failure and lethal pulmonary hemorrhages leading to mortality. In this study, we have performed a proteomic analysis of serum samples from leptospirosis patients (n = 6), febrile controls (falciparum malaria) (n = 8) and healthy subjects (n = 18) to obtain an insight about disease pathogenesis and host immune responses in leptospiral infections. 2DE and 2D-DIGE analysis in combination with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS revealed differential expression of 22 serum proteins in leptospirosis patients compared to the healthy controls. Among the identified differentially expressed proteins, 8 candidates exhibited different trends compared to the febrile controls. Functional analysis suggested the involvement of differentially expressed proteins in vital physiological pathways, including acute phase response, complement and coagulation cascades and hemostasis. This is the first report of analysis of human serum proteome alterations in leptospirosis patients, which revealed several differentially expressed proteins, including \u03B1-1-antitrypsin, vitronectin, ceruloplasmin, G-protein signaling regulator, apolipoprotein A-IV, which have not been reported in context of leptospirosis previously. This study will enhance our understanding about leptospirosis pathogenesis and provide a glimpse of host immunological responses. Additionally, a few differentially expressed proteins identified in this study may further be investigated as diagnostic or prognostic serum biomarkers for leptospirosis.

These viral agents either primarily cause pneumonia or predispose animals to the development of pneumonia. Although, the role of BRSV and BPI-3 in the pathogenesis of pneumonia is well established, there are no reports of involvement of BRSV and BPI-3 from Indian cattle and buffaloes suffering from pneumonia. In the present investigation, we performed postmortem examinations of 406 cattle and buffaloes which were below twelve months of age. Out of 406 cases, twelve (2.95%) cases were positive for BRSV and fifteen (3.69%) cases were positive for BPI-3, screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further, positive cases were confirmed by sequence analysis of RT-PCR amplicons and direct immunofluorescence antibody test (d-FAT) in paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections. BRSV positive cases revealed characteristic findings of bronchiolar epithelial necrosis, thickened alveolar septa by mononuclear cells infiltration and edema; alveolar lumens were filled with mononuclear cells and numerous syncytial cells were seen having intracytoplasmic inclusions. The BRSV antigen distribution was found to be in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells in the lung sections. In fifteen cases where BPI-3 was detected, bronchointerstitial pneumonia in the majority of cases with thickened alveolar septa by mild macrophage infiltration, hyperplasia of type-II pneumocytes and bronchiolar necrosis along with syncytial cells having intracytoplasmic inclusions in the majority of cases were observed. The BPI-3 antigen distribution was found to be in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium and syncytial cells in the lung sections. RT-PCR amplicons of BRSV and BPI-3 obtained were sequenced and their analysis showed homology with already available sequences in the NCBI database.

As environmental exposures do not respect state borders, a globalist concept of global health response has developed, which requires transparency and cooperation for coordinated responses to disease outbreaks. Countries that avoid cooperation on health issues for social or political reasons can endanger the global community. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the rapid change in China\u0027s infectious disease policy between 2000 and 2013, from actively rejecting the assistance of international health experts during the HIV/AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome crises to following best-practice disease response policies and cooperating with international health actors during the 2013 avian influenza outbreak. METHODS: Using international relations theory, I examined whether international political factors had a major influence on this change. Using the case studies of international reputation, socialization with international organizations, and the securitization of infectious disease, this study examined the influence of international and domestic pressures on Chinese infectious disease policy. FINDINGS: Although international relations theory, especially theories popular in global health diplomacy literature, provide valuable insight into the role of international factors and foreign policy interests in China\u0027s changing approach to infectious disease control, it cannot provide viable explanations without considering the domestic interests of the Chinese government. CONCLUSION: Analysis of state responses to infectious disease using international relations theories must consider domestic political factors.","publish_time":"2016-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goldizen, Fiona C.","journal":"Ann Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e26a0c50d7cc401461714da25edf808cec12b51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103944.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214999616000254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27325075/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214999616000254; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aogh.2016.01.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influence of international","international organizations","international health actors","international political factors","international relations theories","international relations theory","role of international factors","infectious disease control","securitization of infectious disease","China\u0027s infectious disease policy","Chinese infectious disease policy","assistance of international health experts","pandemic disease outbreaks","case studies of international reputation","health issues","domestic political factors","global health diplomacy literature","globalist concept of global health response","best-practice disease response policies","domestic interests","global community","past decades global environmental change","foreign policy interests","domestic pressures","political reasons","rapid change","cooperation","study","Analysis of state responses","theories popular","state borders","coordinated responses","major influence","environmental exposures","Chinese government","China\u0027s changing approach","AIDS","severe acute respiratory syndrome crises","globalization","HIV","valuable insight","urbanization","socialization","risk","viable explanations","movement of people","avian influenza outbreak","transparency","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","Countries","METHODS","FINDINGS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Here the genome sequence of wild-born African cheetahs reveals extreme genomic depletion in SNV incidence, SNV density, SNVs of coding genes, MHC class I and II genes, and mitochondrial DNA SNVs. Cheetah genomes are on average 95 % homozygous compared to the genomes of the outbred domestic cat (24.08 % homozygous), Virunga Mountain Gorilla (78.12 %), inbred Abyssinian cat (62.63 %), Tasmanian devil, domestic dog and other mammalian species. Demographic estimators impute two ancestral population bottlenecks: one \u003E100,000 years ago coincident with cheetah migrations out of the Americas and into Eurasia and Africa, and a second 11,084\u201312,589 years ago in Africa coincident with late Pleistocene large mammal extinctions. MHC class I gene loss and dramatic reduction in functional diversity of MHC genes would explain why cheetahs ablate skin graft rejection among unrelated individuals. Significant excess of non-synonymous mutations in AKAP4 (p\u003C0.02), a gene mediating spermatozoon development, indicates cheetah fixation of five function-damaging amino acid variants distinct from AKAP4 homologues of other Felidae or mammals; AKAP4 dysfunction may cause the cheetah\u2019s extremely high (\u003E80 %) pleiomorphic sperm. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides an unprecedented genomic perspective for the rare cheetah, with potential relevance to the species\u2019 natural history, physiological adaptations and unique reproductive disposition.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and the potential clinical relevance of HBoV. Using molecular tests, we tested 1352 nasopharyngeal samples obtained between October 1, 2017 and April 30, 2018 from children up to the age of 16 with RTD for the presence of HBoV DNA and 20 other respiratory pathogens at three different hospitals in Belgium. HBoV was detected in 77 children with a median age of 10.6 months. Consecutive samples were available for 15 HBoV-positive children and showed persistent HBoV positivity in four of them. Monoinfection was observed in six infants. Four of them were born prematurely and were infected during hospitalization at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Only one of these six monoinfected children was diagnosed with recurrent wheezing due to HBoV. This child was carried to term and had a high viral load. Coinfections, most frequently with rhinovirus (52.1%) and adenovirus (49.3%), were observed in 72 patients. In seventeen of them in which HBoV was present at high viral load or higher viral load than its copathogens, bronchi(oli)tis (n = 8), recurrent wheezing (n = 8) or episodic wheezing (n = 1) were diagnosed. Our results suggest that HBoV infection at high viral load in infants is associated with wheezing (P = 0.013, Cramer\u2019s V = 0.613).

For example, a patient admitted to a room previously occupied by a patient colonized or infected with one of these pathogens has a higher risk for acquiring one of these pathogens than a patient admitted to a room whose previous occupant was not colonized or infected. This risk is not surprising because multiple studies have demonstrated that surfaces in hospital rooms are poorly cleaned during terminal cleaning. To reduce surface contamination after terminal cleaning, no touch methods of room disinfection have been developed. This article will review the no touch methods, ultraviolet light devices, and hydrogen peroxide systems, with a focus on clinical trials which have used patient colonization or infection as an outcome. Multiple studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet light devices and hydrogen peroxide systems have been shown to inactivate microbes experimentally plated on carrier materials and placed in hospital rooms and to decontaminate surfaces in hospital rooms naturally contaminated with multidrug-resistant pathogens. A growing number of clinical studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet devices and hydrogen peroxide systems when used for terminal disinfection can reduce colonization or health care\u2013associated infections in patients admitted to these hospital rooms.","publish_time":"2016-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weber, David J.; Rutala, William A.; Anderson, Deverick J.; Chen, Luke F.; Sickbert-Bennett, Emily E.; Boyce, John M.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86d1fbf7ceb272e0f35e3dd549724ee3c1f9f8a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132689.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2015.11.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655315011803; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655315011803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27131140/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospital rooms","ultraviolet devices","hydrogen peroxide systems","associated pathogens","patient colonization","ultraviolet light devices","multidrug-resistant pathogens","terminal disinfection","terminal cleaning","multiple studies","touch methods of room disinfection","contamination of environmental surfaces","growing number of clinical studies","vancomycin-resistant enterococci","transmission of key health care","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","associated infections","clinical trials","surface contamination","higher risk","Clostridium difficile","important role","patients","focus","Acinetobacter spp","carrier materials","substantial scientific evidence","previous occupant","decade","microbes","outcome","article","example"],"language":"en"},

Based upon data arising from S1 sequence and phylogenetic analyses, the three IBV isolates were genetically different from other known IBV types, which represented a novel genotype (GI-29). Virus cross-neutralization tests, using \u03B3CoV/ck/China/I0111/14 as a representative, showed that genotype GI-29 was antigenically different from all other known IBV types, thus representing a novel serotype. Complete genomic analysis showed that GI-29 type viruses were closely related to and might originate from a GX-YL5-like virus by accumulation of substitutions in multiple genes. These GI-29 viral genomes are still evolving and diverging, particularly in the 3\u2032 region, although we cannot rule out the possibility of recombination events occurring. For isolate \u03B3CoV/ck/China/I0114/14, we found that recombination events had occurred between nsps 2 and 3 in gene 1 which led to the introduction of a 4/91 gene fragment into the \u03B3CoV/ck/China/I0114/14 viral genome. In addition, we found that the GI-29 type \u03B3CoV/ck/China/I0111/14 isolate was a nephropathogenic strain and high pathogenic to 1-day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens although cystic oviducts were not observed in the surviving layer chickens challenged with \u03B3CoV/ck/China/I0111/14 isolate.","publish_time":"2017-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Lei; Zhao, Wenjun; Han, Zongxi; Chen, Yuqiu; Zhao, Yan; Sun, Junfeng; Li, Huixin; Shao, Yuhao; Liu, Liangliang; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a5e3cc5d0c327e29e68bc22784df98b8c6f2061.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106192.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.08.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28800976/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134817302630; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134817302630","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["China","isolate \u03B3CoV","type \u03B3CoV","I0111","genotype GI","IBV isolates","known IBV types","I0114","novel genotype","infectious bronchitis virus","surviving layer chickens","possibility of recombination events","Virus cross-neutralization tests","gene fragment","viral genomes","novel serotype","type viruses","SPF","day-old specific pathogen-free","strains","phylogenetic analyses","accumulation of substitutions","nephropathogenic strain","S1 sequence","cystic oviducts","I0118","multiple genes","Complete genomic analysis","data","introduction","nsps","Guangxi province","representative","GX-YL5","diverging","addition","region"],"language":"en"},

However, studies on the seroepidemeology of hMPV are very limited in China. To assess the seroprevalence of hMPV infection in China, we tested a total of 1,156 serum specimens for the presence of anti-hMPV IgG antibody in children and adults free of acute respiratory illness in Beijing, China by using hMPV nucleocapsid (N) protein as an antigen. As a control, we used the human serum antibody against the N protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), the most important viral agent responsible for ARIs in children. RESULTS: The seropositive rate for hMPV increased steadily with age from 67% at 1-6 mo to 100% at age 20. However, the rate dropped slightly between 6 mo and 1 yr of age. The seropositive rate for hRSV also increased steadily with age from 71% at 1-6 mo to 100% at age 20. In children aged six months to six years, the seropositive rates for the anti-hRSV IgG antibody were significantly higher than those for hMPV. Additionally, IgG antibody titers to hMPV and hRSV were significantly higher in adults than in young children. Consistent with the seropositive rates, the geometric mean titer of anti-hMPV IgG antibody was lower than that of anti-hRSV IgG antibody in children aged six months to six years. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that similar to hRSV, exposure to hMPV is ubiquitous in the Beijing population. However, the seroprevalence of anti-hMPV IgG antibody is lower than that of hRSV in children between six months and six years old, which suggests a different number of repeat infections or a different response to infections.","publish_time":"2011-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Guilan; Gonzalez, Richard; Guo, Li; Wu, Chao; Wu, Jiang; Vernet, Guy; Paranhos-Baccal\u00E0, Gl\u00E1ucia; Wang, Jianwei; Hung, Tao","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e42218bb9ddb954382e0db792ffeae988bf62545.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3046927.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310026/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-62","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["anti-hRSV IgG antibody","seroprevalence of anti-hMPV IgG antibody","presence of anti-hMPV IgG antibody","hMPV nucleocapsid","seroepidemeology of hMPV","IgG antibody titers","seroprevalence of hMPV infection","geometric mean titer of anti-hMPV IgG antibody","human serum antibody","young children","seropositive rates","China","months","yr of age","acute respiratory tract infections","N protein of human respiratory syncytial virus","Human metapneumovirus","years old","RESULTS","adults free of acute respiratory illness","different number of repeat infections","different response","serum specimens","Beijing population","ARTIs","important viral agent responsible","ARIs","infants","exposure","total","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","antigen","control","studies"],"language":"en"},

This process is delicately adjusted by the variant residues of MHC I, especially the residues in the peptide binding groove (PBG). In a series of MHC I molecules, a salt bridge is formed above the N-terminus of the peptides. However, the potential impact of the salt bridge on peptide binding and T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of MHC I, as well as the corresponding molecular basis, are still largely unknown. Herein, we determined the structures of HLA-B*4001 and H-2Kd in which two different types of salt bridges (Arg62-Glu163 or Arg66-Glu163) across the PBG were observed. Although the two salt bridges led to different conformation shifts of both the MHC I \u03B1 helix and the peptides, binding of the peptides with the salt bridge residues was relatively conserved. Furthermore, through a series of in vitro and in vivo investigations, we found that MHC I mutations that disrupt the salt bridge alleviate peptide binding and can weaken the TCR recognition of MHC I-peptide complexes. Our study may provide key references for understanding MHC I-restricted peptide recognition by T-cells.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ji, Wei; Niu, Ling; Peng, Weiyu; Zhang, Yongli; Cheng, Hao; Gao, Feng; Shi, Yi; Qi, Jianxun; Gao, George F.; Liu, William J.","journal":"Molecular Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e025e2771d41b9e5b80e22901f69a23edd833a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112684.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31226552/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589019300860; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.06.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589019300860","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","PBG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["series of MHC","TCR recognition of MHC","salt bridge residues","variant residues of MHC","restricted peptide recognition","peptide binding groove","T-cell recognition","peptide complexes","different types of salt bridges","T-cell receptor","T-cells","viral peptides presentation","molecules","PBG","Arg62-Glu163","Arg66-Glu163","different conformation","major histocompatibility complex class","pivotal role","subsequent virus clearance","\u03B1 helix","key references","potential impact","Kd","N-terminus","mutations","corresponding molecular basis","structures of HLA","study","investigations","process"],"language":"en"},

Whilst IFN-\u03BB shares many features with type I IFN induction and signalling pathways, the tissue-specific restricted expression of its receptor, IL28RA, makes IFN-\u03BB a major mediator of host innate immunity in tissues and organs with a high epithelial cell content. Host susceptibility and responses to infection are known to be heterogeneous, and the identification of common genetic variants linked to disease outcome by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has underscored the significance of host polymorphisms in responses to infection. Several such GWAS have highlighted the IFN-\u03BB locus on chromosome 19q13 as an area of genetic variation significantly associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and the rs12979860 genotype can be used in clinical practice as a biomarker for predicting a successful response to treatment with pegylated IFN and ribavarin. Here, we discuss IFN-\u03BB genetic polymorphisms and their role in HCV and other infectious diseases as well as their potential impact on clinical diagnostics, patient stratification and therapy.

We aimed to assess the effects of training with N95 or higher filter respirators on the protection performance of respirators among healthcare providers in the emergency medical center (EMC). METHODS: This randomized crossover study evaluated 23 healthcare providers. Quantitative fit tests (QNFTs) were performed before and after training using three types of N95 or higher filter respirators (cup-type, fold-type, valve-type). Training was performed by lecture, real-time feedback, and fit check. The primary outcome was the fit factor, and the secondary outcomes were overall fit factor, adequate protection rate, and respiratory preference. RESULTS: Fit factors, overall fit factor, and adequate protection rate were higher after training than before training for the 3 types of respirators (all P \u003C .05). For normal breathing, fit factors before and after training were 121 (10\u2013185) vs 192 (161\u2013200) for cup-type, 200 (39\u2013200) vs 200 (200\u2013200) for fold-type, and 85 (18\u2013157) vs 173 (117\u2013200) for valve-type. For normal breathing, the adequate protection rates before and after training were 62 (0\u2013100) vs 100 (90\u2013100) for cup-type, 100 (0\u2013100) vs 100 (100\u2013100) for fold-type, and 19 (0\u2013100) vs 100 (44\u2013100) for valve-type (all P \u003C .05). The most preferred respirator type was the valve-type (10 persons, 45.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Training on wearing an N95 or higher respirator improved the protection performance of respirators among healthcare providers working in the EMC. The selection of proper respirators and training would be beneficial to the safety of healthcare providers.","publish_time":"2019-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hongjung; Lee, Juncheol; Lee, Sanghyun; Oh, Jaehoon; Kang, Boseung; Lim, Tae Ho; Kang, Hyunggoo","journal":"Medicine (Baltimore)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93c68999496870d3c22d197c05645a9bd747c8cc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/47bd7df352db2b1b093566b04fc328d6f0292c1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6380834.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30732139/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000014250","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["valve-type","cup-type","fold-type","vs","protection performance of respirators","higher filter respirators","types of respirators","effects of training","higher filtering respirators","preferred respirator type","Fit factors","fit check","selection of proper respirators","higher respirator","safety of healthcare providers","adequate protection rates","types of N95","Quantitative fit tests","healthcare settings","normal breathing","EMC","improper selection","secondary outcomes","emergency medical center","randomized crossover study","real-time feedback","respiratory preference","lecture","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","QNFTs","primary outcome","RESULTS","risk of infection","CONCLUSIONS","persons"],"language":"en"},

None of the bronchiolitis severity parameters including intensive care unit admission, O(2) supply, O(2) saturation percentage, O(2) length and length of stay at the hospital appeared to be significantly increased in multiple viral infections compared to single viral infections (P \u003E 0.1). In conclusion, the use of this DNA microarray in clinical virology practice allows rapid and accurate identification of common and uncommon viral respiratory pathogens in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. It should improve the clinical management, the epidemiological survey, and the prevention of the nosocomial transmission of respiratory viruses in pediatric wards. J. Med.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of PCV2 ORF5 protein on autophagy and viral replication.

Thus, analyzing the viral diversity harbored by rodents could assist efforts to predict and reduce the risk of future emergence of zoonotic viral diseases. RESULTS: We used next-generation sequencing metagenomic analysis to survey for a range of mammalian viral families in rodents and other small animals of the orders Rodentia, Lagomorpha, and Soricomorpha in China. We sampled 3,055 small animals from 20 provinces and then outlined the spectra of mammalian viruses within these individuals and the basic ecological and genetic characteristics of novel rodent and shrew viruses among the viral spectra. Further analysis revealed that host taxonomy plays a primary role and geographical location plays a secondary role in determining viral diversity. Many viruses were reported for the first time with distinct evolutionary lineages, and viruses related to known human or animal pathogens were identified. Phylogram comparison between viruses and hosts indicated that host shifts commonly happened in many different species during viral evolutionary history. CONCLUSIONS: These results expand our understanding of the viromes of rodents and insectivores in China and suggest that there is high diversity of viruses awaiting discovery in these species in Asia. These findings, combined with our previous bat virome data, greatly increase our knowledge of the viral community in wildlife in a densely populated country in an emerging disease hotspot.

SKP2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation in a hetero-complex involving FKBP51, PHLPP, AKT1, and BECN1. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 decreases BECN1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances autophagic flux.

The compounds showed antiparasitic activities against T. brucei and time-dependent inhibition of cathepsin L-like proteases with K(i) values in the low micromolar range.","publish_time":"2011-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pimentel-Elardo, Sheila M.; Buback, Verena; Gulder, Tobias A.M.; Bugni, Tim S.; Reppart, Jason; Bringmann, Gerhard; Ireland, Chris M.; Schirmeister, Tanja; Hentschel, Ute","journal":"Mar Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e3230d271fea2714dd544af802180200812419d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3210601.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/md9101682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22072992/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRESIMS"],"locations":["Mediterranean sponge Axinella"],"keyphrases":["cathepsin B","cysteine proteases","antiparasitic activities","tetromycin B","compounds","time-dependent inhibition of cathepsin","Trypanosoma brucei","protease inhibition","viral proteases SARS-CoV","D NMR spectroscopy","new tetromycin derivatives","rhodesain","Leishmania major","values","falcipain","Mediterranean sponge Axinella polypoides","HRESIMS analysis","low micromolar range","Streptomyces axinellae Pol001","tetromycins","Structures","PL"],"language":"en"},

However, Ctry2459 cannot suppress established infection of HCV because of the poor cellular uptake and restriction of endosomes. Based on the molecular template of the Ctry2459 peptide, we designed two histidine-rich peptides (Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3) with significantly enhanced cellular uptake and improved intracellular distribution. Moreover, the two mutated peptides, as well as the wild-type peptide Ctry2459, exhibited virucidal activities against HCV. In distinct contrast to the Ctry2459 peptide, the mutated peptides significantly suppressed the established HCV infection at the cellular level but demonstrated lower cytotoxic and hemolytic activities.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of this infection in children and adults. METHODS: We evaluated the epidemiologic characteristics of patients infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (4,463 patients, age range from 2 mo to 86 y), and the clinical and laboratory findings of 373 inpatients (80/217 children, \u2264 15 y, had pneumonia and 36/156 adults, \u003E 16 y, had pneumonia) in a single hospital during the epidemic. RESULTS: The majority of infected patients (94%) were less than 40 y, and greater than 90% of cases occurred during a two-month period. The rates of admission and pneumonia were 8.4% (373/4,463) and 2.5% (116/4,463), respectively. The rates of admission and pneumonia, total duration of fever, the frequency of underlying diseases, and the values of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate tended to increase as age increased; highest rates were found in the \u2265 65 y group. Pneumonia was founded more boys than girls in children, but more female than male in adults. The adult patients with pneumonia had higher leukocyte counts with lower lymphocyte differentials than the group without pneumonia, as shown in children group. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the immunologic reaction to viral insults may be associated with age, sex and underlying diseases, and that unknown herd immunity may affect populations. The patients with underlying diseases, especially in older patients may have immunologic insufficiency that is associated with immunologic consumption by the underlying diseases.","publish_time":"2012-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rhim, Jung-Woo; Go, Eun-Ji; Lee, Kyung-Yil; Youn, You-Sook; Kim, Myung-Sook; Park, Sun Hee; Kim, Ji-Chang; Kang, Jin-Han","journal":"Int Arch Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b82539a18c6aea935321822f2de5937fd7fef769.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3331808.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22443897/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1755-7682-5-13","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia"],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["pneumonia","y group","older patients","adult patients","children group","frequency of underlying diseases","epidemiologic characteristics of patients","majority of infected patients","adults","rates of admission","age range","immunologic insufficiency","immunologic reaction","immunologic consumption","laboratory characteristics","RESULTS","highest rates","laboratory findings","H1N1 influenza","influenza pandemic","higher leukocyte","reactive protein","lower lymphocyte differentials","total duration of fever","values of C","erythrocyte sedimentation rate","virus","infection","unknown herd immunity","viral insults","inpatients","girls","populations","South Korea","single hospital","male","boys","sex","cases","study","epidemic","METHODS","month period","aim","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigated in vitro the effects of CXCL10 in activated human primary T lymphocytes in terms of apoptosis or survival, and delineated the signaling pathways that are involved. CXCL10, in combination with IL-2 and/or IFN\u03B1, induces apoptosis in T lymphocytes. Moreover, CXCL10-induced activation of CXCR3 also triggers pro-survival signals that can be blocked by pertussis toxin. The analysis of the downstream signaling kinases shows that apoptosis is p38 MAPK-dependent and the pro-survival signals rely on the sustained activation of PI3K and the transient activation of Akt. On the other hand, the transient activation of p44/p42 ERK did not have an impact on T lymphocyte survival. We propose an immunological model in which CXCL10, together with other co-stimulating cytokines, participates in the activation of T lymphocytes, promotes survival and expansion of certain lymphocyte subsets, and induces chemotaxis toward the infected tissues.

Respiratory infections are very common. They are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality and are costly in terms of lost time from work, inappropriate use of antibiotics, and lengthy hospital stays. Laboratory detection of causative agents can influence treatment and allow appropriate infection control measures, potentially saving time and money, promoting quicker recovery for the patient, and lowering the risk of nosocomial transmission of the organism. Molecular testing may be the most sensitive method of detecting respiratory viruses. These methods have been shown to detect multiple viruses in a single sample more often than any of the other methods described and, in addition, can detect viruses that are difficult or impossible to grow. The detection of nonviable organisms may provide additional insight into disease but provides its own challenges in terms of determining clinical significance of positive results. Like many areas of clinical medicine and microbiology, the increasing use of molecular diagnostics for detection of respiratory viruses raises many new questions for the laboratory and the clinical diagnostician, but also promises many benefits as these methods become increasingly available for routine use.","publish_time":"2010-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carr, Jeanne; Williams, Donna G.; Hayden, Randall T.","journal":"Molecular Diagnostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f39f714b92770a09beeef5caf31330e5296221a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149945.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123694287000240; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123694287000240","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of respiratory viruses","molecular detection of multiple respiratory viruses","multiple viruses","methods","Respiratory infections","increasing use of molecular diagnostics","detection of nonviable organisms","routine use","Molecular testing","Laboratory detection of causative agents","clinical diagnostician","inappropriate use of antibiotics","terms of lost time","areas of clinical medicine","clinical significance of positive results","treatment","work","microbiology","appropriate infection control measures","mortality","chapter","new questions","additional insight","sensitive method","significant morbidity","disease","quicker recovery","money","lengthy hospital stays","challenges","Publisher Summary","risk of nosocomial transmission","patient","benefits","single sample"],"language":"en"},

During 1996\u20132006, we obtained mortality data for non-accidental and cardiorespiratory causes, visibility recorded as visual range in kilometers, temperature, and relative humidity from an urban observatory, and concentrations of four criteria pollutants. A generalized additive Poisson regression model with penalized cubic regression splines was fitted to control for time variant covariates. For non-accidental mortality, an interquartile range (IQR) of 6.5 km decrease in visibility at lag 0\u20131 days was associated with an excess risk (ER%) [95% CI] of 1.13 [0.49, 1.76] for all ages and 1.37 [0.65, 2.09] for ages 65 years and over; for cardiovascular mortality of 1.31 [0.13, 2.49] for all ages, and 1.72 [0.44, 3.00] for ages 65 years and over; and for respiratory mortality of 1.92 [0.49, 3.35] for all ages and 1.76 [0.28, 3.25] for ages 65 years and over.

Visibility provides a useful proxy for the assessment of environmental health risks from ambient air pollutants and a valid approach for the assessment of the public health impacts of air pollution and the benefits of air quality improvement measures in developing countries where pollutant monitoring data are scarce.","publish_time":"2010-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thach, Thuan-Quoc; Wong, Chit-Ming; Chan, King-Pan; Chau, Yuen-Kwan; Chung, Yat-Nork; Ou, Chun-Quan; Yang, Lin; Hedley, Anthony J.","journal":"Environ Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75147688efca273289fb60c6a007d8530ac37ffc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/21d98e3c9427e96a21a4dc7f37d420c42cd6e864.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094411.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2010.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20627276/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935110000721; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935110000721","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["ages","mortality data","daily mortality","cardiovascular mortality","respiratory mortality","years","non-accidental mortality","short-term mortality effects of daily loss of visibility","air pollutant data","days","ambient air pollutants","pollutant monitoring data","lag","public health impacts of air pollution","benefits of air quality improvement measures","assessment of environmental health risks","visual range","interquartile range","criteria pollutants","estimated ER","penalized cubic regression splines","generalized additive Poisson regression model","developing countries","cardiorespiratory causes","control","kilometers","particulate matter","terms of magnitude","valid approach","response relationships","relative humidity","pattern","temperature","urban observatory","useful proxy","aerodynamic diameter","exposure","concentrations","\u03BCm","time variant covariates","mist","absence of fog","precipitation","excess risk","IQR","Hong Kong"],"language":"en"},

However, this process is inefficient, results in adaptive mutations, and involves deletion of viral genes to avoid oversized genomes when inserting the BAC cassette. Moreover, BAC technology does not permit the simultaneous manipulation of multiple genome loci and cannot be used to construct synthetic genomes. To overcome these limitations, we adapted synthetic biology tools to clone CMV genomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using an early passage of the human CMV isolate Toledo, we first applied transformation-associated recombination (TAR) to clone 16 overlapping fragments covering the entire Toledo genome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Then, we assembled these fragments by TAR in a stepwise process until the entire genome was reconstituted in yeast. Since next-generation sequence analysis revealed that the low-passage-number isolate represented a mixture of parental and fibroblast-adapted genomes, we selectively modified individual DNA fragments of fibroblast-adapted Toledo (Toledo-F) and again used TAR assembly to recreate parental Toledo (Toledo-P). Linear, full-length HCMV genomes were transfected into human fibroblasts to recover virus. Unlike Toledo-F, Toledo-P displayed characteristics of primary isolates, including broad cellular tropism in vitro and the ability to establish latency and reactivation in humanized mice. Our novel strategy thus enables de novo cloning of CMV genomes, more-efficient genome-wide engineering, and the generation of viral genomes that are partially or completely derived from synthetic DNA. IMPORTANCE The genomes of large DNA viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), are difficult to manipulate using current genetic tools, and at this time, it is not possible to obtain, molecular clones of CMV without extensive tissue culture. To overcome these limitations, we used synthetic biology tools to capture genomic fragments from viral DNA and assemble full-length genomes in yeast. Using an early passage of the HCMV isolate Toledo containing a mixture of wild-type and tissue culture-adapted virus. we directly cloned the majority sequence and recreated the minority sequence by simultaneous modification of multiple genomic regions. Thus, our novel approach provides a paradigm to not only efficiently engineer HCMV and other large DNA viruses on a genome-wide scale but also facilitates the cloning and genetic manipulation of primary isolates and provides a pathway to generating entirely synthetic genomes.","publish_time":"2017-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vashee, Sanjay; Stockwell, Timothy B.; Alperovich, Nina; Denisova, Evgeniya A.; Gibson, Daniel G.; Cady, Kyle C.; Miller, Kristofer; Kannan, Krishna; Malouli, Daniel; Crawford, Lindsey B.; Voorhies, Alexander A.; Bruening, Eric; Caposio, Patrizia; Fr\u00FCh, Klaus","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d0778430adbbbc96d00837831f9a1ce1d4ff35b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5628293.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28989973/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mspheredirect.00331-17","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAC","CMV","Linear","HCMV"],"locations":["Toledo"],"keyphrases":["synthetic genomes","adapted Toledo","full-length genomes","entire Toledo genome","parental Toledo","Toledo-P","Toledo-F","oversized genomes","generation of viral genomes","fibroblast-adapted genomes","full-length HCMV genomes","synthetic DNA","genomes of large DNA viruses","viral DNA","novo cloning of CMV genomes","entire genome","human CMV","synthetic biology tools","genomic fragments","individual DNA fragments of fibroblast","genome-wide scale","tissue culture-adapted virus","efficient genome-wide engineering","simultaneous manipulation of multiple genome loci","overlapping fragments","human cytomegalovirus","early passage","molecular clones of CMV","extensive tissue culture","current genetic tools","Genetic engineering of cytomegalovirus","genetic manipulation of primary isolates","mixture of parental","minority sequence","deletion of viral genes","infected tissue culture cells","TAR assembly","low-passage","human fibroblasts","majority sequence","generation sequence analysis","Saccharomyces cerevisiae","BAC technology","BAC cassette","limitations","number isolate","yeast","characteristics of primary isolates","simultaneous modification of multiple genomic regions","mixture of wild","stepwise process","novel strategy","novel approach","bacterial origin of replication","bacterial artificial chromosome","applied transformation-associated recombination","type","broad cellular tropism","ability","adaptive mutations","latency","reactivation","results","pathway","IMPORTANCE","humanized mice","paradigm","time"],"language":"en"},

Significant and sustained efforts have focused on mobilization of personal protective equipment, intensive care beds, and medical equipment, while substantially less attention has focused on preserving the psychological health of the medical workforce tasked with addressing the challenges of the pandemic. And yet, similar to battlefield conditions, health care workers are being confronted with ongoing uncertainty about resources, capacities, and risks; as well as exposure to suffering, death, and threats to their own safety. These conditions are engendering high levels of fear and anxiety in the shortterm, and place individuals at risk for persistent stressexposure syndromes, subclinical mental health symptoms, and professional burnout in the longterm. Given the potentially wide-ranging mental health impact of COVID-19, protecting health care workers from adverse psychological effects of the pandemic is critical. Therefore, we present an overview of the potential psychological stress responses to the COVID-19 crisis in medical providers and describe preemptive resilience-promoting strategies at the organizational and personal level. We then describe a rapidly deployable Psychological Resilience Intervention founded on a peersupport model (Battle Buddies) developed by the United States Army. This intervention\u2014the product of a multidisciplinary collaboration between the Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychiatry \u0026 Behavioral Sciences at the University of Minnesota Medical Center\u2014also incorporates evidence-informed \u201Cstress inoculation\u201D methods developed for managing psychological stress exposure in providers deployed to disasters. Our multilevel, resource-efficient, and scalable approach places 2 key tools directly in the hands of providers: (1) apeersupport Battle Buddy; and (2) adesignated mental health consultant who can facilitate training in stress inoculation methods, provide additional support, or coordinate referral for external professional consultation. In parallel, we have instituted a voluntary research data-collection component that will enable us to evaluate the intervention\u2019s effectiveness while also identifying the most salient resilience factors for future iterations. It is our hope that these elements will provide guidance to other organizations seeking to protect the well-being of their medical workforce during the pandemic. Given the remarkable adaptability of human beings, we believe that, by promoting resilience, our diverse health care workforce can emerge from this monumental challenge with new skills, closer relationships, and greater confidence in the power of community.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Albott, Cristina Sophia; Wozniak, Jeffrey R.; McGlinch, Brian P.; Wall, Michael H.; Gold, Barbara S.; Vinogradov, Sophia","journal":"Anesth Analg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f5cade02f4dc71291ab265e69e6e59102b6ffbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199769.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345861/; https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004912","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United States Army"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["psychological health","health care workers","health care systems","diverse health care workforce","mental health consultant","medical providers","medical workforce","psychological stress exposure","medical equipment","subclinical mental health symptoms","wide-ranging mental health impact of COVID","deployable Psychological Resilience Intervention","pandemic","potential psychological stress responses","stress inoculation methods","preemptive resilience","intensive care beds","adverse psychological effects","University of Minnesota Medical Center","salient resilience factors","hands of providers","unprecedented challenges","mobilization of personal protective equipment","professional burnout","personal level","battlefield conditions","Battle Buddies","external professional consultation","apeersupport Battle Buddy","persistent stressexposure syndromes","closer relationships","place individuals","Behavioral Sciences","monumental challenge","scalable approach places","training","greater confidence","Departments of Anesthesiology","new skills","key tools","additional support","evidence-informed","peersupport model","anxiety","shortterm","Psychiatry","referral","strategies","crisis","rapid global spread","resource-efficient","multidisciplinary collaboration","ongoing uncertainty","high levels of fear","voluntary research data-collection component","resources","capacities","future iterations","overview","sustained efforts","threats","elements","guidance","remarkable adaptability of human beings","organizations","power of community","United States Army","suffering","death","risks","product","coronavirus disease","well-being","disasters","attention","hope","outbreak","longterm","intervention\u2019s effectiveness","safety"],"language":"en"},

To promote elderly people\u2019s behavioral compliance toward influenza prevention, the aim of the current project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory-based low-administration-cost intervention building on a leading psychological theory, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). METHODS: The target group is Hong Kong Chinese elderly people aged 65 or older who rarely or never adopt any preventive actions. This project will be conducted in three phases over 24 months. In phase 1, intervention program will be developed building on the HAPA theoretical framework which comprises both the initiation and maintenance of influenza prevention behaviors. In phase 2, intervention will be implemented and evaluated using a randomized controlled trial, including: (a) behavior initiation only, (b) behavior initiation \u002B behavior maintenance, and (c) control group. Both the initiation and maintenance components will comprise weekly-delivered telephone-based individual intervention sessions in 3 months. In phase 3, outcome evaluation of behavioral and psychological variables and process evaluation will be conducted. The effectiveness of the intervention will be analyzed using a series of linear mixed models on each behavioral and psychological outcome variable. Structural equation modelling will be used to test the hypothesized theoretical sequence in the HAPA model.

Prefusion-stabilized RSV F variants have been engineered as vaccine antigens, but crystal structures of these variants have revealed conformational differences in a key antigenic site located at the apex of the trimer, referred to as antigenic site \u00D8. Currently, it is unclear if flexibility in this region is an inherent property of prefusion RSV F or if it is related to inadequate stabilization of site \u00D8 in the engineered variants. Therefore, we set out to investigate the conformational flexibility of antigenic site \u00D8, as well as the ability of the human immune system to recognize alternative conformations of this site, by determining crystal structures of prefusion RSV F bound to neutralizing human-derived antibodies AM22 and RSD5. Both antibodies bound with high affinity and were specific for the prefusion conformation of RSV F. Crystal structures of the complexes revealed that the antibodies recognized distinct conformations of antigenic site \u00D8, each diverging at a conserved proline residue located in the middle of an \u03B1-helix. These data suggest that antigenic site \u00D8 exists as an ensemble of conformations, with individual antibodies recognizing discrete states.

Using the prototype species equine torovirus (EToV), we performed parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to analyze the relative expression levels of the known torovirus proteins and transcripts, chimeric sequences produced via discontinuous RNA synthesis (a characteristic of the nidovirus replication cycle), and changes in host transcription and translation as a result of EToV infection. RNA sequencing confirmed that EToV utilizes a unique combination of discontinuous and nondiscontinuous RNA synthesis to produce its subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs); indeed, we identified transcripts arising from both mechanisms that would result in sgRNAs encoding the nucleocapsid. Our ribosome profiling analysis revealed that ribosomes efficiently translate two novel CUG-initiated open reading frames (ORFs), located within the so-called 5\u2032 untranslated region. We have termed the resulting proteins U1 and U2. Comparative genomic analysis confirmed that these ORFs are conserved across all available torovirus sequences, and the inferred amino acid sequences are subject to purifying selection, indicating that U1 and U2 are functionally relevant. This study provides the first high-resolution analysis of transcription and translation in this neglected group of livestock pathogens. IMPORTANCE Toroviruses infect cattle, goats, pigs, and horses worldwide and can cause gastrointestinal disease. There is no treatment or vaccine, and their ability to spill over into humans has not been assessed. These viruses are related to important human pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and they share some common features; however, the mechanism that they use to produce sgRNA molecules differs. Here, we performed deep sequencing to determine how equine torovirus produces sgRNAs. In doing so, we also identified two previously unknown open reading frames \u201Chidden\u201D within the genome. Together these results highlight the similarities and differences between this domestic animal virus and related pathogens of humans and livestock.","publish_time":"2018-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stewart, Hazel; Brown, Katherine; Dinan, Adam M.; Irigoyen, Nerea; Snijder, Eric J.; Firth, Andrew E.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daaa53a49dc0d23015e22a150495ac657aa993d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6096809.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29950409/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00589-18","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","U2"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA-seq","available torovirus sequences","genus Torovirus","parallel RNA sequencing","sgRNAs","known torovirus proteins","nondiscontinuous RNA synthesis","prototype species equine torovirus","related pathogens of humans","ribosome profiling analysis","chimeric sequences","translation","horses","cattle","goats","ORFs","pigs","high-resolution analysis of transcription","result of EToV infection","transcripts","deep sequencing","U2","neglected group of livestock pathogens","unknown open reading frames","important human pathogens","resulting proteins U1","Comparative genomic analysis","inferred amino acid sequences","domestic ungulates","Ribo-seq","host transcription","range of species","domestic animal virus","unique combination of discontinuous","acute self-limiting gastroenteritis","severe acute respiratory syndrome","subfamily Torovirinae","family Coronaviridae","order Nidovirales","changes","purifying selection","characteristic","relative expression levels","differences","coronavirus","SARS","novel CUG","ribosomes","sheep","nidovirus replication cycle","subgenomic RNAs","similarities","IMPORTANCE Toroviruses","ability","common features","treatment","vaccine","untranslated region","results","gastrointestinal disease","genome","study","mechanisms","sgRNA molecules","nucleocapsid"],"language":"en"},

Astrogliosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells are prominent findings in the brains and spinal cords of infected mice. In this report, astrocytes in infected spinal cords were analyzed for expression of three pleiotropic cytokines, TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, and IL-6; Type 2 nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); and MHC class I and II antigen. The data show that all three cytokines and iNOS are expressed by astrocytes in chronically infected spinal cords. These activated astrocytes are localized to areas of virus infection and demyelination, although most of the astrocytes expressing these proteins are not MHV-infected. MHC class I and II antigen can be detected in these spinal cords as well, but not in cells with the typical morphology of astrocytes. TNF-\u03B1, IL-6, and iNOS are also evident in the brains of mice with MHV-induced acute encephalitis, but in marked contrast to the results obtained with the chronically infected mice, most of the cells expressing these cytokines or iNOS had the morphology of macrophages or other mononuclear cells and very few appeared to be astrocytes. Additionally, astrocytes and, most likely, oligodendrocytes are infected in the spinal cords of mice with chronic demyelination. These results are consistent with a role for both viral infection of glial cells and high localized levels of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide in the demyelinating process in mice infected with MHV-JHM. They also show that analogously to the human demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, astrocytes are a major cellular source for these cytokines in mice with chronic, but not acute disease.","publish_time":"1995-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"SUN, NING; GRZYBICKI, DANA; CASTRO, RAYMOND F.; MURPHY, SEAN; PERLMAN, STANLEY","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70e99176982f7dba3252e9b307b80d6056b54b41.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682285700219; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682285700219","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spinal cords of infected mice","infected spinal cords","MHV-infected","spinal cords of mice","brains of mice","activated astrocytes","Abstract Mice","iNOS","typical morphology of astrocytes","MHV-JHM","pleiotropic cytokines","mononuclear cells","viral infection of glial cells","infiltration of inflammatory cells","high localized levels of proinflammatory cytokines","demyelinating process","demyelinating encephalomyelitis","areas of virus infection","human demyelinating disease","chronic demyelination","acute disease","TNF-\u03B1","results","MHC class","antigen","nitric oxide synthase","neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus","acute encephalitis","morphology of macrophages","multiple sclerosis","prominent findings","expression","major cellular source","role","Type","marked contrast","oligodendrocytes","report","Astrogliosis","weeks","proteins","data"],"language":"en"},

Because effective therapies are lacking, early identification and mitigation of risk factors is a pragmatic approach to improve outcomes. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is the most pervasive risk factor for CLAD, but diagnosis requires transbronchial biopsy, which carries risks. We hypothesized that gene expression in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell pellet (CP) could replace biopsy and inform on mechanisms of CLAD. METHODS We performed RNA sequencing on BAL CPs from 219 lung transplant recipients with A-grade ACR (n = 61), lymphocytic bronchiolitis (n = 58), infection (n = 41), or no rejection/infection (n = 59). Differential gene expression was based on absolute fold difference \u003E2.0 and Benjamini-adjusted p-value \u22640.05. We used the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery Bioinformatics Resource for pathway analyses. For classifier modeling, samples were randomly split into training (n = 154) and testing sets (n = 65). A logistic regression model using recursive feature elimination and 5-fold cross-validation was trained to optimize area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS Differential gene expression identified 72 genes. Enriched pathways included T-cell receptor signaling, natural killer cell\u2013mediated cytotoxicity, and cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction. A 4-gene model (AUC = 0.72) and classification threshold defined in the training set exhibited fair performance in the testing set; accuracy was 76%, specificity 82%, and sensitivity 60%. In addition, classification as ACR was associated with worse CLAD-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.42; 95% confidence interval = 1.29\u20134.53). CONCLUSIONS BAL CP gene expression during ACR is enriched for immune response pathways and shows promise as a diagnostic tool for ACR, especially ACR that is a precursor of CLAD.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weigt, S.

In view of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), clinical trials have been designed to examine the effects of inhaled nitric oxide in COVID-19 subjects. We discuss here additional lifestyle factors such as mouth breathing which may affect the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 by bypassing the filtering effect of the nose and by decreasing NO levels in the airways.

The number of people able to provide first-person accounts of the atrocities of the Holocaust is dwindling in numbers. Prior to the mass extermination of Jews at Auschwitz and other extermination camps, nurses actively participated in the execution of tens of thousands of mentally, physically, and emotionally ill German citizens. Nursing educators must ensure that nursing students not only know about the Holocaust, but that they know that ordinary nurses were directly involved in the identification of vulnerable humans to be killed, and actually murdered them. Social, economic, and political pressures existed enabling the Nazi regime to involve nurses in this way. Similarly, social, economic, and political pressures today have the potential to encourage nurses to act in ways that violate personal or professional values. This paper provides four learning objectives that can be incorporated into existing nursing curricula to ensure that nurses do not forget how and why nurses in Germany came to murder more than 10,000 people in their care. With the passage of time comes the risk that the legacy of the Holocaust will be forgotten, nursing educators must participate in preventing that from happening.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Copeland, Darcy","journal":"Journal of professional nursing : official journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba1512880c0e2bce1e3def5cbf48fdb40340bb2a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426757/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8755722320301095?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.profnurs.2020.05.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S8755722320301095","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Auschwitz","Germany"],"keyphrases":["ordinary nurses","Holocaust","Nursing educators","nursing students","political pressures","existing nursing curricula","extermination camps","liberation of Auschwitz","mass extermination of Jews","number of people able","first-person accounts","Nazi regime","risk","ways","professional values","anniversary","legacy","atrocities","potential","learning objectives","passage of time","execution of tens","identification of vulnerable humans","ill German citizens","paper","thousands","year","care","numbers","Germany"],"language":"en"},

However, no study to date has focused on the role of IFITM proteins in DNA virus restriction. Here, we demonstrate that IFN-\u03B1 or -\u03B2 treatment of keratinocytes substantially decreases human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) infection while robustly inducing IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression. However, IFITM1, 2 and 3 overexpression did not inhibit HPV16 infection; rather, IFITM1 and IFITM3 modestly enhanced HPV16 infection in various cell types including primary keratinocytes. Moreover, IFITM1, 2 and 3 did not inhibit infection by two other DNA viruses, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5). Taken together, we reveal that the entry of several DNA viruses, including HPV, HCMV, and Ad5 is not affected by IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression.

However, there have been few reports on the causative virus of exacerbations in Korean adult asthmatics. Thus, we compared frequencies and types of viruses between lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTIs) with exacerbations (exacerbated LRTIs) and those without exacerbations (stable LRTIs) to evaluate contribution of respiratory viruses to exacerbations. METHODS: Viral RNA was extracted from sputum using the Viral Gene-spin\u2122 Kit. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect adenovirus (ADV), metapneumovirus (MPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1/2/3, influenza virus (IFV) A, IFV B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B, and rhinovirus (RV) A. RESULTS: Among the 259 patients, 210 underwent a single sputum examination, and the remaining 49 underwent 2 to 4 sputum examinations. Virus was detected in 68 of the 259 exacerbated episodes and in 11 of the 64 stable episodes. Among the exacerbated episodes, RV was the most frequently detected virus, followed by influenza A, parainfluenza, RSV A/B, and ADV. Among the 11 stable episodes, RV was most frequently detected. Detection rates of these viruses did not differ between the 2 groups (P\u003E0.05). Thirty-five patients underwent the virus examination at 2 episodes of exacerbation, while 14 patients underwent at each time of exacerbated and stable episodes. Virus detection rate at the second examination was significantly higher in cases with 2 exacerbation episodes than in those with initial exacerbation and sequential stable episodes (P=0.003). A seasonal pattern was noted in the detection rates of RV (September to December), IFV (January to April), PIV (May to September), and RSV A/B (September to April). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses were identified in approximately 20% of LRTI irrespective of the presence of asthma exacerbation. RV and IFV A/B were most frequently detected. A group of patients experienced frequent viral infections followed by asthma exacerbations.","publish_time":"2017-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seo, Ki-Hyun; Bae, Da-Jeong; Kim, Ji-Na; Lee, Ho-Sung; Kim, Yong-Hoon; Park, Jong-Sook; Kim, Myung-Shin; Chang, Hun-Soo; Son, Ji-Hye; Baek, Dong-Gyu; Lee, Jun-Suk; Park, Choon-Sik","journal":"Allergy Asthma Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db94e7aa6b683896a9ff5a239003a0c351f60041.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5603477.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4168/aair.2017.9.6.491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28913988/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV A/B","ADV","LRTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["episodes of exacerbation","exacerbation episodes","exacerbated episodes","detected virus","virus examination","causative virus of exacerbations","parainfluenza virus","sequential stable episodes","IFV B","respiratory syncytial virus","asthma exacerbations","stable LRTIs","Virus detection rate","exacerbated LRTIs","detection rates of RV","contribution of respiratory viruses","RSV","initial exacerbation","Viral RNA","types of viruses","group of patients","time of exacerbated","frequent viral infections","single sputum examination","presence of asthma exacerbation","Viral Gene-spin","sputum examinations","PIV","lower respiratory tract illnesses","Korean adult asthmatics","Caucasian adult asthmatics","Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","RT-PCR","metapneumovirus","MPV","cases","adenovirus","ADV","Kit","frequencies","RESULTS","rhinovirus","reports","seasonal pattern","METHODS","PURPOSE","CONCLUSIONS","groups"],"language":"en"},

Its antiviral compound is a kind of lignan, which is formed with the action of dirigent proteins (DIR). DIR proteins are members of a large family of proteins which impart stereoselectivity on the phenoxy radical-coupling reaction, yielding optically active lignans from two molecules of E-coniferyl alcohol. They exist in almost every vascular plant. However, the DIR and DIR-like protein gene family in I. indigotica has not been analyzed in detail yet. This study focuses on discovery and analysis of this protein gene family in I. indigotica for the first time. RESULTS: Analysis of transcription profiling database from I. indigotica revealed a family of 19 full-length unique DIR and DIR-like proteins. Sequence analysis found that I. indigotica DIR and DIR-like proteins (IiDIR) were all-beta strand proteins, with a signal peptide at the N-terminus. Phylogenetic analysis of the 19 proteins indicated that the IiDIR genes cluster into three distinct subfamilies, DIR-a, DIR-b/d, and DIR-e, of a larger plant DIR and DIR-like gene family. Gene-specific primers were designed for 19 unique IiDIRs and were used to evaluate patterns of constitutive expression in different organs. It showed that most IiDIR genes were expressed comparatively higher in roots and flowers than stems and leaves. CONCLUSIONS: New DIR and DIR-like proteins were discovered from the transcription profiling database of I. indigotica through bioinformatics methods for the first time. Sequence characteristics and transcript abundance of these new genes were analyzed. This study will provide basic data necessary for further studies.

AIM: We aimed to describe the clinical course and functional outcomes of critically ill healthcare workers (HCWs) with MERS. METHODS: Data on HCWs was extracted from a multi-center retrospective cohort study on 330 critically ill patients with MERS admitted between (9/2012\u20139/2015). Baseline demographics, interventions and outcomes were recorded and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Survivors were approached with questionnaires to elucidate their functional outcomes using Karnofsky Performance Status Scale. FINDINGS: Thirty-Two HCWs met the inclusion criteria. Comorbidities were recorded in 34% (11/32) HCW. Death resulted in 8/32 (25%) HCWs including all 5 HCWs with chronic renal impairment at baseline. Non-surviving HCW had lower PaO2/FiO2 ratios 63.5 (57, 116.2) vs 148 (84, 194.3), p = 0.043, and received more ECMO therapy compared to survivors, 9/32 (28%) vs 4/24 (16.7%) respectively (p = 0.02).Thirteen of the surviving (13/24) HCWs responded to the questionnaire. Two HCWs confirmed functional limitations. Median number of days from hospital discharge until the questionnaires were filled was 580 (95% CI 568, 723.5) days. CONCLUSION: Approximately 10% of critically ill patients with MERS were HCWs. Hospital mortality rate was substantial (25%). Patients with chronic renal impairment represented a particularly high-risk group that should receive extra caution during suspected or confirmed MERS cases clinical care assignment and during outbreaks. Long-term repercussions of critical illness due to MERS on HCWs in particular, and patients in general, remain unknown and should be investigated in larger studies.","publish_time":"2018-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shalhoub, Sarah; Al-Hameed, Fahad; Mandourah, Yasser; Balkhy, Hanan H.; Al-Omari, Awad; Al Mekhlafi, Ghaleb.

Nevertheless, such outbreaks continue to disrupt the travel industry. This aspect of the IHR has received little attention in the academic literature despite its considerable impact on affected States and commercial activity. This paper outlines the challenges and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationship between outbreaks and the travel sector and discusses the opportunities for further research and policy work to overcome these challenges. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a literature review on the relationship between outbreaks and travel restrictions, with a particular focus on the 2014\u201316 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. This review was complemented by an expert roundtable at Chatham House and further supported by case studies and qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Numerous travel stakeholders are affected by, and affect, large-scale infectious disease outbreaks. These stakeholders react in different ways: peer pressure plays an important role for both governments and the travel sector, and the reactions of the media and public influence and are influenced by these stakeholders. While various data sources on travel are available, and WHO is mandated to work with States, there is no recognised coordinating body to disseminate timely, consistent, reliable and authoritative information and best practices to all stakeholders. CONCLUSION: This article highlights the interdependent relationship between various travel stakeholders. The reasons for interruption of travel during the 2014\u201316 Ebola outbreak were complex, with decisions by States only partly contributing to the cessation. Decisions by non-state actors, particularly the travel industry itself, contributed significantly and were based on a variety of factors. Further research, analysis and policy development is required to mitigate the health and economic consequences of infectious disease outbreaks. Any further research will also need to take account of COVID-19 travel related issues.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vaidya, Ria; Herten-Crabb, Asha; Spencer, Julia; Moon, Suerie; Lillywhite, Louis","journal":"J Travel Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6938297682c56af3c1ae130dd918076b4b7417c2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32297935/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taaa050","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IHR"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["travel sector","travel industry","travel restrictions","interruption of travel","various travel stakeholders","Numerous travel stakeholders","travel related issues","transnational infectious disease outbreaks","large-scale infectious disease outbreaks","research","economic consequences of infectious disease outbreaks","affected States","interdependent relationship","literature review","IHR","decisions","policy work","challenges","academic literature","Ebola epidemic","Ebola outbreak","policy development","various data sources","considerable impact","authoritative information","peer pressure","important role","best practices","health","reactions","opportunities","case studies","Chatham House","non-state actors","little attention","different ways","commercial activity","recognised coordinating body","expert roundtable","gaps","article","account of COVID","governments","knowledge","public influence","particular focus","unwarranted interruptions","qualitative interviews","media","key purpose","West Africa","analysis","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","paper","aspect","METHODOLOGY","reasons","variety of factors","cessation"],"language":"en"},

Despite its importance in North Atlantic fisheries and potential use in aquaculture, relatively few gene expression examination exists for this species, and systematic evaluations of reference gene stability in quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) studies are lacking. RESULTS: The stability of 10 potential reference genes was examined in six tissues of Atlantic cod obtained from four populations, to determine the most suitable genes to be used in qRT-PCR analyses. Relative transcription levels of genes encoding \u03B2-actin (ACTB), elongation factor 1A (EF1A), actin-related protein-2 (ARP-2), glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ubiquitin (Ubi), acidic ribosomal protein (ARP), ribosomal protein S9 (S9), ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4), RPL22 and RPL37 were quantified in gills, brain, liver, head kidney, muscle and middle intestine in six juvenile fish from three wild populations and from farmed Atlantic cod. Reference gene stability was investigated using the geNorm and NormFinder tools. Based on calculations performed with the geNorm, which determines the most stable genes from a set of tested genes in a given cDNA sample, ARP, Ubi, S9 and RPL37 were among the most stable genes in all tissues. When the same calculations were done with NormFinder, the same genes plus RPL4 and EF1A were ranked as the preferable genes. CONCLUSION: Overall, this work suggests that the Ubi and ARP can be useful as reference genes in qRT-PCR examination of gene expression studying wild populations of Atlantic cod.","publish_time":"2008-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olsvik, P\u00E5l A; S\u00F8fteland, Liv; Lie, Kai K","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35808155b612d2189d338168dc1cc0e0b7401661.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2527504.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18710500/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-1-47","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Genbank","ARP"],"locations":["Atlantic","North Atlantic"],"keyphrases":["stable genes","potential reference genes","suitable genes","preferable genes","ARP","set of tested genes","tissues of Atlantic cod","wild populations of Atlantic cod","ribosomal protein S9","farmed Atlantic cod","qRT-PCR examination of gene expression","Relative transcription levels of genes","gene expression examination","ribosomal protein L4","acidic ribosomal protein","qRT-PCR analyses","systematic evaluations of reference gene stability","actin-related protein","North Atlantic fisheries","EF1A","RPL37","RPL4","geNorm","calculations","quantitative real-time RT-PCR","potential use","\u03B2-actin","NormFinder tools","aquaculture","head kidney","given cDNA sample","muscle","middle intestine","place","species","recent years","juvenile fish","Gadus morhua","liver","brain","gills","ubiquitin","ACTB","RPL22","number of ESTs","Extensive sequencing efforts","GAPDH","elongation factor","importance","P-dehydrogenase","BACKGROUND","glyceraldehyde","work","studies","Genbank","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

It is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and affects both galliform and nongalliform birds. Its economic impact includes decreased egg production and poor egg quality in layers, stunted growth, poor carcass weight, and mortality in broiler chickens. Although primarily affecting the respiratory tract, IBV demonstrates a wide range of tissues tropism, including the renal and reproductive systems. Thus, disease outcome may be influenced by the organ or tissue involved as well as pathotypes or strain of the infecting virus. Knowledge on the epidemiology of the prevalent IBV strains in a particular region is therefore important to guide control and preventions. Meanwhile previous diagnostic methods such as serology and virus isolations are less sensitive and time consuming, respectively; current methods, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and sequencing, offer highly sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic results, thus enabling the genotyping of new viral strains within the shortest possible time. This review discusses aspects on pathogenesis and diagnostic methods for IBV infection.","publish_time":"2016-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bande, Faruku; Arshad, Siti Suri; Omar, Abdul Rahman; Bejo, Mohd Hair; Abubakar, Muhammad Salisu; Abba, Yusuf","journal":"Adv Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38bed8a14f2f6103cf5f8ddc6db772c8ab52f7c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4756178.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26955391/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/4621659","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV infection","prevalent IBV strains","previous diagnostic methods","infectious bronchitis virus","current methods","virus isolations","infecting virus","poor egg quality","accurate diagnostic results","time consuming","decreased egg production","poor carcass weight","shortest possible time","important poultry diseases","genotyping of new viral strains","RT-PCR","layers","stunted growth","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","pathogenesis","Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism","serology","particular region","wide range of tissues tropism","RFLP","mortality","economic impact","sequencing","pathotypes","epidemiology","aspects","broiler chickens","respiratory tract","control","review","reproductive systems","organ","nongalliform birds","Knowledge","preventions","disease outcome"],"language":"en"},

This study was conducted to investigate if there was a seasonal variation in the incidence of hMPV infection in young children and possible associations between hMPV infection and local meteorological parameters in Suzhou, China. A total of 6,655 children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) admitted to the Children\u2019s Hospital affiliated to Soochow University, Suzhou, were tested from January 2006 to December 2009 for the presence of hMPV using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The relationship between the presence of the virus and regional meteorological conditions was analyzed by linear and multivariate regression analysis. The overall hMPV infection incidence over the four-year study was 8.2 %, 8.1 %, 12.7 % and 7.4 % per year, respectively. Four hundred eighty-eight hMPV-positive children (78.2 %) were younger than 3 years of age. hMPV infections appear to have a seasonal distribution in Suzhou. In 2006, 2007 and 2009, the peak seasons were in December to January, while in 2008, the peak of hMPV activity occurred in May. The incidence of hMPV infection was negatively correlated with the average monthly temperature and rainfall. hMPV was one of the most common viral pathogens after respiratory syncytial virus that was associated with acute respiratory tract infection in children in Suzhou. hMPV infection occurred throughout the year with peaks during late winter and early spring. Climatic factors, especially monthly average temperature, may affect the prevalence of hMPV in Suzhou.","publish_time":"2012-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yuqing; Chen, Zhengrong; Yan, Yong Dong; Guo, Hongbo; Chu, Chu; Liu, Jing; Ding, Yunfang; Shao, Xuejun; Xu, Jun; Ji, Wei","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20bcdb9acf775464e3ceb33225811db3637ae78e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087041.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-012-1492-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23074040/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Soochow University"],"locations":["Suzhou","China"],"keyphrases":["incidence of hMPV infection","presence of hMPV","prevalence of hMPV","hMPV infections","hMPV-positive children","overall hMPV infection incidence","peak of hMPV activity","Suzhou","acute respiratory tract infection","young children","seasonal activity","respiratory syncytial virus","important respiratory pathogen","seasonal variation","average monthly temperature","monthly average temperature","seasonal distribution","four-year study","peak seasons","local meteorological parameters","regional meteorological conditions","possible associations","peaks","ARTI","common viral pathogens","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","late winter","Children\u2019s Hospital","early spring","Soochow University","Climatic factors","China","multivariate regression analysis","rainfall","different populations","total","Human metapneumovirus","years of age","relationship"],"language":"en"},

Surveillance is important to better appreciate this evolving pandemic and to longitudinally monitor the effectiveness of public health measures. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide a rapid, easy to establish and costeffective laboratory-based surveillance tool for SARS-CoV-2. Study design: We used minipools of RNA prepared from nucleic acid extractions of routine respiratory samples. We technically validated the assay and distributed the protocol within an informal network of five German university laboratories. RESULTS: We tested a total of 70 minipools resembling 700 samples shortly before the upsurge of cases in Germany from 17.02.2020- 10.03.2020. One minipool reacted positive and after resolution one individual sample tested SARS-COV-2 positive. This sample was from a hospitalized patient not suspected of having contracted SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach of a laboratory-based surveillance for SARSCoV-2 using minipools proved its concept is easily adaptable and resource-saving.

Furthermore, formation of CK8 and CK18 complexes due to CK8 phosphorylation at Ser73 and Ser431 was found to be strongly associated with promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis by PB and the development of hepatocellular carcinomas. The data were confirmed by immunohistochemistry and real-time Q-PCR and profound overexpression of CK8 and CK18 (CK8/18) proteins and mRNAs were detected in several large size GST-P positive foci and liver tumors. A strong correlation between CK8/18 positive foci development and multiplicity of hepatocellular carcinomas was further observed. Moreover, elevation of CK8/18 was strongly associated with induction of cell proliferation in GST-P positive foci and tumors. In conclusion, our data imply that CK8/18 overexpression, those two cytokeratins complex formation associated with histone type 2 H2aa3 up-regulation and intermediate filament reorganization may drive neoplastic transformation of GST-P positive foci during rat hepatocarcinogenesis leading to the formation of hepatocellular carcinomas.","publish_time":"2009-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kakehashi, Anna; Inoue, Masayo; Wei, Min; Fukushima, Shoji; Wanibuchi, Hideki","journal":"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7440e73586a86e38a773cb529bca7ffef7a1afb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126293.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X09001689; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2009.04.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19409407/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041008X09001689","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DEN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["formation of CK8","CK8 phosphorylation","elevation of CK8","positive foci development","profound overexpression of CK8","large size GST-P positive foci","formation of hepatocellular carcinomas","development of hepatocellular carcinomas","multiplicity of hepatocellular carcinomas","neoplastic transformation of GST","significant overexpression of cytokeratin","histone type","H2aa3","CK18 complexes","liver tumors","PB","data","cytokeratins complex formation","rat hepatocarcinogenesis","promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis","proteome of microdissected glutathione S-transferase placental form","ionization time","MS","SELDI-TOF","ProteinChip arrays","surface-enhanced laser desorption","CM10","flight mass spectrometry","intermediate filament reorganization","regulation","real-time Q-PCR","induction of cell proliferation","immunohistochemistry","Q10","Ser73","mRNAs","Abstract Screening","strong correlation","DEN","diethylnitrosamine","livers of rats","dose","weeks","phenobarbital","Ser431","proteins","microsomal cytochrome","conclusion","ppm"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We provided remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support. Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day. RESULTS: Of the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error). Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan. At baseline, 30 patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated. A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 patients (13%) died; mortality was 18% (6 of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among those not receiving invasive ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). Measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy.

Here, we describe the first documented case of interspecific killing and partial consumption of a feral cat by an adult male Iberian lynx reintroduced in Southwestern Spain. Ulterior analyses demonstrated that the victim was viremic to feline leukemia virus. To prevent the dissemination of the virus and a potential outbreak in the Iberian lynx population, control measures, including the clinical evaluation of the male Iberian lynx, and intensive monitoring were implemented in order to detect intraspecific interactions. After 3 weeks, the lynx was evaluated, presented good condition and resulted negative to both ELISA and RT-PCR. Thanks to the long-term monitoring, this case could be detected and measures to prevent an outbreak could be implemented.","publish_time":"2019-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"N\u00E1jera, F.; S\u00E1nchez-Cuerda, S.; L\u00F3pez, G.; Del Rey-Wamba, T.; Rueda, C.; Vallverd\u00FA-Coll, N.; Panadero, J.; Palacios, M.

In experimental animals (primates, rats, and mice), VSV has been shown to lead to neurotoxicities, such as hind limb paralysis. The virus matrix protein (M) and glycoprotein (G) are both major pathogenic determinants of wild-type VSV and have been the major targets for the production of attenuated strains. Existing strategies for attenuation included: (1) deletion or M51R substitution in the M protein (VSV\u0394M51 or VSVM51R, respectively); (2) truncation of the C-terminus of the G protein (G\u039428). Despite these mutations, recombinant VSV with mutated M protein is only moderately attenuated in animals, whereas there are no detailed reports to determine the pathogenicity of recombinant VSV with truncated G protein at high dose. Thus, a novel recombinant VSV (VSV\u0394M51-G\u039428) as well as other attenuated VSVs (VSV\u0394M51, VSV-G\u039428) were produced to determine their efficacy as vaccine vectors with low pathogenicity. In vitro studies indicated that truncated G protein (G\u039428) could play a more important role than deletion of M51 (\u0394M51) for attenuation of recombinant VSV. VSV\u0394M51-G\u039428 was determined to be the most attenuated virus with low pathogenicity in mice, with VSV-G\u039428 also showing relatively reduced pathogenicity. Further, neutralizing antibodies stimulated by VSV-G\u039428 proved to be significantly higher than in mice treated with VSV\u0394M51-G\u039428. In conclusion, among different attenuated VSVs with mutated M and/or G proteins, recombinant VSV with only truncated G protein (VSV-G\u039428) demonstrated ideal balance between pathogenesis and stimulating a protective immune response. These properties make VSV-G\u039428 a promising vaccine vector and vaccine candidate for preventing vesicular stomatitis disease.","publish_time":"2012-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Xinkui; Zhang, Shikuan; Sun, Xiaodong; Li, Jinjin; Sun, Tao","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a5f20b486e6fc4026a369d024173c65c063c6fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126045.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11020342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22222871/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11020342; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.12.085","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VSV-G\u039428","VSV\u0394M51-G\u039428","pathogenicity of recombinant VSV","type VSV","attenuation of recombinant VSV","novel recombinant VSV","truncated G protein","attenuated virus","virus matrix protein","G proteins","low pathogenicity","mice","promising vaccine vector","different attenuated VSVs","vaccine candidate","vaccine vectors","reduced pathogenicity","production of attenuated strains","promising vector","Abstract Vesicular stomatitis virus","vesicular stomatitis disease","major targets","deletion of M51","experimental animals","major pathogenic determinants of wild","pathogenesis","horses","oral tissues","ulceration","tongue","rats","ideal balance","C-terminus","high dose","cattle","swine","feet","vesiculation","important role","primates","efficacy","glycoprotein","protective immune response","M51R substitution","neurotoxicities","hind limb paralysis","acute diseases","teats","conclusion","detailed reports","oncolysis","mutations","studies","properties","truncation","Existing strategies","VSVM51R","antibodies"],"language":"en"},

In 2002, a research project was carried out in a range of sectors of the Australian tourism industry to investigate the impact of the collapse of the HIH Insurance Company, the World Trade Centre attacks and the demise of Ansett Airlines on these organisations and the range of responses adopted to these events. This paper describes the preparedness of organisations to respond to these events; the personnel or human resource (HR) strategies implemented and the postscript, the organisational learning which had occurred. Interview findings indicate that there was little preparation for such events, a widespread reluctance to retrench staff, and limited organisational learning had taken place.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anderson, Barbara A","journal":"Tourism Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e0fb78c4543e6199a5c15b888a1a95103f131fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131075.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2005.06.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026151770500083X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S026151770500083X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287718/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIH Insurance Company","Ansett Airlines"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["events","World Trade Centre attacks","HIH Insurance Company","demise of Ansett Airlines","collapse","Australian tourism industry","limited organisational learning","Gulf War","Iraq War","range of sectors","range of responses","preparedness of organisations","SARS","severe acute respiratory syndrome","HR","Asian economic crisis","outbreak","human resource","staff","series","impact","strategies","epidemic","little preparation","widespread reluctance","personnel","postscript","Bali bombings","dotcom crash","pilots\u2019 strike","crises","place","Interview findings","Abstract","shocks\u2019","paper","research project"],"language":"en"},

MagaZorb nucleic acid isolation technology overcomes these challenges and offers a simple and reliable method for isolation of highquality and high-yield nucleic acids. Although the MagaZorb technology is readily adaptable to automated platforms, it is also well suited to laboratories in remote areas of resource-poor countries, because a simple magnet is the only device required to perform the procedure manually. Performance characteristics and clinical application of the MagaZorb technology are briefly described here.","publish_time":"2010-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nargessi, Dokhi; Ou, Chin-Yih","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13308417e5ddd18811556922a44f72ad7aeb3e8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110191.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20225944/; https://doi.org/10.1086/650391","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MagaZorb technology","MagaZorb nucleic acid isolation technology","Effective isolation of nucleic acids","viral materials","presence of small amounts of viral nucleic acids","accurate diagnosis of viral infections","challenges","isolation of highquality","clinical laboratories","carry-over of polymerase chain reaction inhibitors","essential step","critical step","clinical application","simple magnet","total RNA","abundant levels of genomic DNA","processing of various sample types","samples","analytical identification","poor countries","remote areas of resource","routine practice","programs","reliable method","automated platforms","microarray results","Performance characteristics","monitoring epidemics","molecular assays","device","necessity","pandemics","procedure"],"language":"en"},

During virus infection, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level excessively rises. LDH is a cytosolic enzyme and the serum level increases as the cell break down. When anaerobic conditions develop, lactate formation increases from pyruvate. Cell pH is regulated by very complex mechanisms. When lactate increases in the extracellular area, this symporter carries lactate and H(\u002B) ion into the cell, and the intracellular pH quickly becomes acidic. Paradoxically, Na(\u002B)/H(\u002B) exchanger activation takes place. While H(\u002B) ion is thrown out of the cell, Na(\u002B) and Ca(\u002B2) enter the cell. When Na(\u002B) and Ca(\u002B2) increase in the cell, the cells swell and die. Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. Dapagliflozin has been reported to reduce lactate levels by various mechanisms. Also, it reduces oxygen consumption in tissues and causes the use of glucose in the aerobic pathway, thereby reducing lactate production. A lactate decrease in the environment reduces the activation of lactate/H(\u002B) symporter. Thus, the H ion pumping into the cell by this symporter is reduced and the cytosolic pH is maintained. Dapagliflozin also directly inhibits NHE. Thus, Na(\u002B) and Ca(\u002B2) flow to the cell are inhibited. Dapagliflozin provides the continuation of the structure and functions of the cells. Dapagliflozin can prevent the severe course of COVID-19 infection by preventing the lowering of cytosolic pH and reducing the viral load.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cure, Erkan; Cumhur Cure, Medine","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b0b619906d760c452ea907f82b2403bbf80edc6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195078.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335366/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120300898; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.024; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120300898","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dapagliflozin"],"organizations":["LDH","NHE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cell pH","activation of lactate","Dapagliflozin","lactate formation","lactate production","lactate levels","H ion","serum lactate dehydrogenase","low cytosolic pH","lowering of cytosolic pH","intracellular pH","symporter","Ca","cytosolic enzyme","serum level increases","virus infection","LDH","cells","use of glucose","exchanger activation","various mechanisms","complex mechanisms","sodium-glucose cotransporter","severe course of COVID","frequent occurrence of COVID","aerobic pathway","patients","tissues","structure","extracellular area","functions","inhibitor","continuation","anaerobic conditions","viral load","environment","oxygen consumption","place","pyruvate","flow","NHE"],"language":"en"},

Diversifying these functions within individuals and populations are rapidly-evolving interactions between highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands and variable NK cell receptors. Specific to simian primates is the family of Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR), which recognize MHC class I and associate with a range of human diseases. Because KIR have considerable species-specificity and are lacking from common animal models, we performed extensive comparison of the systems of KIR and MHC class I interaction in humans and chimpanzees. Although of similar complexity, they differ in genomic organization, gene content, and diversification mechanisms, mainly because of human-specific specialization in the KIR that recognizes the C1 and C2 epitopes of MHC-B and -C. Humans uniquely focused KIR recognition on MHC-C, while losing C1-bearing MHC-B. Reversing this trend, C1-bearing HLA-B46 was recently driven to unprecedented high frequency in Southeast Asia. Chimpanzees have a variety of ancient, avid, and predominantly inhibitory receptors, whereas human receptors are fewer, recently evolved, and combine avid inhibitory receptors with attenuated activating receptors. These differences accompany human-specific evolution of the A and B haplotypes that are under balancing selection and differentially function in defense and reproduction. Our study shows how the qualitative differences that distinguish the human and chimpanzee systems of KIR and MHC class I predominantly derive from adaptations on the human line in response to selective pressures placed on human NK cells by the competing needs of defense and reproduction.","publish_time":"2010-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abi-Rached, Laurent; Moesta, Achim K.; Rajalingam, Raja; Guethlein, Lisbeth A.; Parham, Peter","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c572b27658746d48b85b25fa8aa9c6d94a47bcf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a7069f86aa3a4d5231c386f08dd28dc3a97b0e0a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0add910e9efb81f7b906101a7790b812074dc8b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2973822.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21079681/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1001192","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","MHC","KIR"],"locations":["Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["human receptors","MHC class","human NK cells","MHC-C","human line","human-specific evolution","human-specific specialization","avid inhibitory receptors","variable NK cell receptors","chimpanzee systems of KIR","C2 epitopes of MHC","range of human diseases","C1","reproduction","focused KIR recognition","attenuated activating receptors","humans","chimpanzees","family of Killer cell Immunoglobulin","B haplotypes","Natural killer","essential functions","qualitative differences","competing needs of defense","selective pressures","ligands","polymorphic major histocompatibility complex","evolving interactions","response","extensive comparison","genomic organization","gene content","diversification mechanisms","associate","adaptations","unprecedented high frequency","simian primates","common animal models","Southeast Asia","populations","balancing selection","immunity","considerable species-specificity","HLA-B46","variety of ancient","individuals","trend","fewer","similar complexity","study"],"language":"en"},

For this purpose, linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from two structural glycoproteins of CCHF virus including Gc and Gn were predicted. The epitopes were further studied regarding their antigenicity, allergenicity, hydrophobicity, stability, toxicity and population coverage. A total number of seven epitopes including five T-cell and two B-cell epitopes were screened for the final vaccine construct. Final vaccine construct composed of 382 amino acid residues which were organized in four domains including linear B-cell, T-cell epitopes and cholera toxin B-subunit (CTxB) along with heat labile enterotoxin IIc B subunit (LT-IIc) as adjuvants. All the segments were joined using appropriate linkers. The physicochemical properties as well as the presence of IFN-\u03B3 inducing epitopes in the proposed vaccine, was also checked to determining the vaccine stability, solubility and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. The 3D structure of proposed vaccine was subjected to the prediction of computational B-cell epitopes and molecular docking studies with MHC-I and II molecules. Furthermore, molecular dynamics stimulations were performed to study the vaccine-MHCs complexes stability during stimulation time. The results suggest that our proposed vaccine was stable, well soluble in water and potentially antigenic.

The University of Guelph recently conducted a five-year outcome assessment using the Core Competencies for Public Health in Canada as an evaluative framework to determine whether graduates are receiving adequate training, and identify areas for improvement. METHODS: A curriculum map of core courses and an online survey of University of Guelph Master of Public Health graduates comprised the outcome assessment. The curriculum map was constructed by evaluating course outlines, assignments, and content to determine the extent to which the Core Competencies were covered in each course. Quantitative survey results were characterized using descriptive statistics. Qualitative survey results were analyzed to identify common themes and patterns in open-ended responses. RESULTS: The University of Guelph Master of Public Health program provided a positive learning environment in which graduates gained proficiency across the Core Competencies through core and elective courses, meaningful practicums, and competent faculty. Practice-based learning environments, particularly in collaboration with public health organizations, were deemed to be beneficial to students\u2019 learning experiences. CONCLUSIONS: The Core Competencies and graduate surveys can be used to conduct a meaningful and informative outcome assessment. We encourage other Master of Public Health programs to conduct their own outcome assessments using a similar framework, and disseminate these results in order to identify best practices and strengthen the Canadian graduate public health education system.","publish_time":"2014-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Britten, Nicole; Wallar, Lauren E; McEwen, Scott A; Papadopoulos, Andrew","journal":"BMC Med Educ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8dada285162e466f7867f6b657853905bd778933.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4131476.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078124/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6920-14-158","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Public Health","University of Guelph Master of Public Health"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["public health organizations","public health sector","Master of Public Health programs","Guelph Master of Public Health graduates","Core Competencies","University of Guelph Master of Public Health program","Canadian graduate public health education system","curriculum map of core courses","five-year outcome assessment","Quantitative survey results","informative outcome assessment","Qualitative survey results","outcome assessments","online survey of University","Canada","graduate surveys","positive learning environment","students\u2019 learning experiences","elective courses","graduate-level trained professionals","meaningful practicums","Practice-based learning environments","evaluative framework","similar framework","course outlines","need","collaboration","proficiency","common themes","best practices","patterns","open-ended responses","content","BACKGROUND","adequate training","competent faculty","descriptive statistics","areas","assignments","order","extent","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","improvement"],"language":"en"},

In 2001, researchers in The Netherlands reported the discovery of a previously unidentified pathogen called human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Since its initial description, hMPV has been associated with ARTI in Europe (Italy, France, Spain, the UK, Germany, Denmark, Finland and Norway), America (the USA, Canada, Argentina and Brazil), Asia (India, Japan, China and Singapore), Australia and South Africa in individuals of all ages. The incidence of infection varies from 1.5% to 25%, indicating that hMPV is a ubiquitous virus with a worldwide distribution. hMPV seems to play an important role as a cause of paediatric upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with similar, but not identical, epidemiological and clinical features to those of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Moreover, the socio-economic impact of hMPV-infected children on their families seems to be considerable, which suggests that, like influenza virus, hMPV infection may be a substantial public health problem for the community. It may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in pre-term infants and children with underlying clinical conditions, although more adequately controlled studies are needed to confirm its importance in such patients. Many fundamental questions concerning the pathogenesis of hMPV disease and the host\u0027s specific immune response remain to be answered. Further studies are also required to properly define hMPV diagnosis, treatment and prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Principi, N.; Bosis, S.; Esposito, S.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a37dfb375744f6209504a698fcc7dbc059420445.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0a8d9887e378df263878873a4b7be141aa224b42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128939.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14615962; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14615962","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Europe","France","Spain","Germany","Denmark","Finland","Argentina","Brazil","Asia","India","China","Singapore","Australia","South Africa"],"keyphrases":["hMPV infection","hMPV diagnosis","pathogenesis of hMPV disease","socio-economic impact of hMPV","influenza virus","respiratory syncytial virus","ubiquitous virus","lower respiratory tract infection","infected children","mortality","ARTIs","incidence of infection","Acute respiratory tract infections","leading cause of morbidity","clinical features","significant morbidity","controlled studies","worldwide distribution","cause of paediatric upper","underlying clinical conditions","pre-term infants","Singapore","substantial public health problem","USA","France","South Africa","Brazil","Spain","Norway","Finland","Asia","UK","Germany","Australia","India","China","host\u0027s specific immune response","unidentified pathogen","important role","discovery","individuals","Canada","Europe","Italy","America","Argentina","Denmark","Japan","community","treatment","prevention strategies","human metapneumovirus","families","fundamental questions","ages","aetiology","researchers","Netherlands"],"language":"en"}]}

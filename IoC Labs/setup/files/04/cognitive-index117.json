L\u2019\u00E9valuation d\u2019un enfant f\u00E9brile de retour de voyage est clinique : v\u00E9rification des ant\u00E9c\u00E9dents et des vaccinations, recherche d\u2019autres cas au contact, signes fonctionnels et physiques, caract\u00E9ristiques du voyage. Un bilan paraclinique de d\u00E9brouillage compl\u00E8te souvent l\u2019\u00E9valuation pour une orientation syndromique. Si les causes de fi\u00E8vre sont surtout cosmopolites, la gravit\u00E9 des pathologies exotiques doit les faire rechercher en priorit\u00E9. Le paludisme doit \u00EAtre \u00E9voqu\u00E9 devant toute fi\u00E8vre en provenance d\u2019Afrique subsaharienne. Le diagnostic repose sur l\u2019association d\u2019un frottis sanguin et d\u2019un test sensible (goutte \u00E9paisse, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) ou d\u2019un test de diagnostic rapide (pour Plasmodium [P]. falciparum). Les crit\u00E8res clinicobiologiques de gravit\u00E9 sont essentiels pour orienter et traiter le patient. En cas d\u2019acc\u00E8s non compliqu\u00E9 \u00E0 P. falciparum, le traitement repose sur une th\u00E9rapie combin\u00E9e \u00E0 base d\u2019art\u00E9misinine (ACT), art\u00E9m\u00E9ther-lum\u00E9fantrine ou art\u00E9nimol-pip\u00E9raquine. Les acc\u00E8s graves sont trait\u00E9s par l\u2019art\u00E9sunate intraveineux, puis un ACT oral. Dengue, chikungunya et infection \u00E0 virus Zika ont des caract\u00E9ristiques cliniques communes (association fi\u00E8vre-\u00E9ruption-arthralgies, traitement symptomatique). En cas de dengue, il faut surveiller l\u2019apparition de signes d\u2019alerte qui pourraient faire craindre une \u00E9volution p\u00E9jorative. Le chikungunya est grave en cas de transmission per partum, avec un risque d\u2019enc\u00E9phalite n\u00E9onatale. Chez l\u2019enfant, le Zika est a- ou peu symptomatique. Mais en cas d\u2019infection pendant une grossesse, le risque est celui d\u2019une embryof\u0153topathie. Le diagnostic de ces arboviroses repose sur la PCR \u00E0 la phase aigu\u00EB et la s\u00E9rologie secondairement. La symptomatologie de la typho\u00EFde est peu sp\u00E9cifique, justifiant la pratique d\u2019h\u00E9mocultures syst\u00E9matiques devant une fi\u00E8vre du retour. Son traitement repose sur les c\u00E9phalosporines de troisi\u00E8me g\u00E9n\u00E9ration ou la ciprofloxacine, mais les r\u00E9sistances augmentent. Au total, la diversit\u00E9 des \u00E9tiologies d\u2019une fi\u00E8vre de retour et la gravit\u00E9 potentielle des infections import\u00E9es imposent une r\u00E9flexion sur le parcours de soins de ces patients, en particulier vis-\u00E0-vis du risque de fi\u00E8vre h\u00E9morragique.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Minodier, P.; Imbert, P.","journal":"J Pediatr Pueric","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/016e8545b58be7f2babf7082171b7790a47a312f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341631/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpp.2020.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0987798320300426?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0987798320300426","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["l\u2019\u00E9tranger","chikungunya"],"keyphrases":["fi\u00E8vre du retour","fi\u00E8vre de retour","retour de voyage","fi\u00E8vre h\u00E9morragique","causes de fi\u00E8vre","cas de dengue","association fi\u00E8vre-\u00E9ruption","caract\u00E9ristiques du voyage","vis du risque","traitement symptomatique","gravit\u00E9 potentielle","PCR","\u00E9valuation","cas de transmission per partum","gravit\u00E9 des pathologies exotiques","chikungunya","test de diagnostic rapide","falciparum","test sensible","infections gastro","infections import\u00E9es","virus Zika","signes fonctionnels","particulier vis","ACT oral","acc\u00E8s graves","apparition de signes","enfant f\u00E9brile","caract\u00E9ristiques cliniques communes","goutte \u00E9paisse","polymerase chain reaction","maladies f\u00E9briles","art\u00E9sunate intraveineux","art\u00E9m\u00E9ther","art\u00E9misinine","r\u00E9flexion","v\u00E9rification des ant\u00E9c\u00E9dents","contact","arthralgies","d\u00E9brouillage compl\u00E8te","th\u00E9rapie combin\u00E9e","h\u00E9mocultures syst\u00E9matiques","ciprofloxacine","parcours de soins","lum\u00E9fantrine","patients","base","frottis sanguin","recherche","vaccinations","provenance","pratique","Plasmodium","c\u00E9phalosporines de troisi\u00E8me g\u00E9n\u00E9ration","bilan paraclinique","diversit\u00E9 des \u00E9tiologies","art\u00E9nimol","pip\u00E9raquine","probl\u00E8mes dermatologiques","phase aigu\u00EB","alerte","crit\u00E8res clinicobiologiques","Afrique subsaharienne","grossesse","orientation syndromique","enc\u00E9phalite n\u00E9onatale","symptomatologie de la typho\u00EFde","s\u00E9rologie","total","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","paludisme","arboviroses","\u00E9volution p\u00E9jorative","r\u00E9sistances","priorit\u00E9","embryof\u0153topathie"],"language":"fr"},

Currently, no specific antiviral therapy against ZIKV is available, and treatments are palliative and mainly directed toward the relief of symptoms, such as fever and rash, by administering antipyretics, anti-histamines, and fluids for dehydration. Nevertheless, lately, search for antivirals has been a major aim in ZIKV investigations. To do so, screening of libraries from different sources, testing of natural compounds, and repurposing of drugs with known antiviral activity have allowed the identification of several antiviral candidates directed to both viral (structural proteins and enzymes) and cellular elements. Here, we present an updated review of current knowledge about anti-ZIKV strategies, focusing on host-directed antivirals as a realistic alternative to combat ZIKV infection.","publish_time":"2018-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saiz, Juan-Carlos; de Oya, Nereida Jim\u00E9nez; Bl\u00E1zquez, Ana-Bel\u00E9n; Escribano-Romero, Estela; Mart\u00EDn-Acebes, Miguel A.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e6b537332182bd3c8f642accc5eae577055a4c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6163279.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v10090453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30149598/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":["Americas"],"keyphrases":["ZIKV investigations","anti-ZIKV strategies","combat ZIKV infection","antiviral candidates","antivirals","known antiviral activity","specific antiviral therapy","anti-histamines","association","different sources","realistic alternative","updated review of current knowledge","global health","enzymes","structural proteins","increased virulence","sanitary alarm","testing of natural compounds","antipyretics","drugs","identification","host","rapid spread","major aim","fever","ophthalmological complications","rash","fluids","neglected pathogen","cellular elements","screening of libraries","introduction","flavivirus","relief of symptoms","threat","dehydration","mosquito","treatments","Zika virus","Americas"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we developed biodegradable PLGA [poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)] nanoparticle-entrapped killed PRRSV vaccine (Nano-KAg), and administered intranasally to pigs once and evaluated the immune correlates. In Nano-KAg vaccinated homologous virus challenged pigs, complete clearance of viremia was observed in 2 weeks, associated with a significant increase in virus neutralizing titers only in the lungs, compared to both unvaccinated and killed vaccine vaccinated pigs. The lung homogenate and sera of Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs had higher levels of IFN-\u03B3 and lower levels of TGF-\u03B2 than control groups. Restimulation of mononuclear cells isolated from the lungs, blood, BAL, and TBLN of Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs\u2019 secreted significantly increased levels of Th1 cytokines, IFN-\u03B3 and IL-12. In addition, higher frequencies of CD3\u002BCD8\u002B, CD4\u002BCD8\u002B, and \u03B3\u03B4 T cells, and reduced frequency of Foxp3\u002B T-regulatory cells were observed in Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs.

Persistence in the LM-K cells was not accompanied by production of is mutants or of soluble anti-MHV factors. Infectious center assay demonstrated an approximately 500-fold lower level of infectibility by MHV of the LM-K cells as compared to L-2 cells. On an infected cell basis, production levels of infectious progeny and viral RNA were comparable between the two cell lines. The extent of virus-induced cell-cell fusion, however, was markedly reduced in the LM-K cells. Cell-mixing experiments showed that both infected L-2 and LM-K cells have the capacity of fusing with neighboring uninfected L-2 cells but not with uninfected LM-K cells. This suggests that the decreased level of fusion observed in the LM-K infection is due not to absence of viral fusion protein at the cell surface, but rather to an inherent resistance of the LM-K cell membrane to MHV-induced fusion. It is believed that such fusion resistance in LM-K cells moderates virus dissemination throughout the culture, thereby contributing to a state of virus persistence.","publish_time":"1983-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizzen, Lee; Cheley, Steve; Rao, Meena; Wolf, Robert; Anderson, Robert","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5eec734574ef20c09a708533829ce6b4908d651.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682283902660; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682283902660","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouse LM cells","uninfected LM","designated LM","induced cell-cell fusion","cell surface","cell membrane","cell lines","fusion resistance","MHV-induced fusion","infected cell basis","decreased level of fusion","virus dissemination","extent of virus","state of virus persistence","absence of viral fusion protein","Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus","production levels of infectious progeny","viral RNA","soluble anti-MHV factors","lytic infection","inherent resistance","Infectious center assay","lower level of infectibility","cultures","mutants","capacity of fusing","subline","experiments"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we describe the first HAdV55\u2010associated hospital outbreak documented in Guangdong, China. METHODS: Active surveillance was conducted in the involved neurosurgical inpatient department. All staff and patients in the involved neurosurgical department were surveyed for any symptoms of fever (\u226538\u00B0C) and enlarged tonsils during the outbreak period. Throat swabs and demographic information were collected for all cases. For each specimen, assays for common respiratory viruses were performed using one\u2010step reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction. HAdV\u2010positive samples were inoculated onto Hep\u20102 cells for isolation. Hexon genes, fiber genes, penton genes, and whole genomes were sequenced. A phylogenetic tree was constructed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Forty\u2010three cases, including 24 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases and 19 possible cases, were identified. Nurses had the highest attack rate of infection, with a rate of 36.4%. The attack rate for doctors and inpatients was 20.0% and 16.7%, respectively. HAdV55 was the sole pathogen identified during this outbreak. The hexon, fiber, and penton genes from seven isolated HAdV55 stains were sequenced. All these genes showed 100% homology and fell into the HAdV55 [P14H11F14] cluster, indicating that HAdV55 was the single viral strain for the outbreak. While not conclusive, the epidemic investigation revealed that the outbreak was introduced by nurses from sources outside the hospital. It was likely that a transmission from staff to inpatients had occurred.","publish_time":"2017-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yi, Lina; Zou, LiRong; Lu, Jing; Kang, Min; Song, Yingchao; Su, Juan; Zhang, Xin; Liang, LiJun; Ni, HanZhong; Ke, Changwen; Wu, Jie","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ce201c2ba233a562ee605a9aa12d2719cfa2beb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5485872.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28488368/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["penton genes","fiber genes","Hexon genes","outbreak period","associated hospital outbreak","possible cases","isolated HAdV55 stains","re\u2010emerging human respiratory pathogen","involved neurosurgical department","staff","Nurses","inpatients","involved neurosurgical inpatient department","highest attack rate of infection","common respiratory viruses","respiratory infections outbreaks","sole pathogen","Human adenovirus type","one\u2010step reverse transcription","polymerase chain reaction","military","school populations","specimen","assays","demographic information","enlarged tonsils","Guangdong","single viral strain","Active surveillance","positive samples","Throat swabs","BACKGROUND","transmission","epidemic investigation","China","doctors","laboratory","sources","P14H11F14","cluster","symptoms of fever","cells","isolation","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","genomes","homology","phylogenetic tree","study"],"language":"en"},

Most viral fusion proteins require priming by proteolytic processing, either of the fusion protein itself or of an accompanying protein. The priming step, which often occurs during transport of the fusion protein to the cell surface but may also occur extracellularly, then prepares the fusion protein for triggering by events that accompany attachment and uptake. Two classes of viral fusion proteins have been identified so far by structural studies. The fusion of two bilayers that these proteins catalyze is likely to proceed by the same pathway in both cases. That is, these proteins are like enzymes that have different structures but that still catalyze the same chemical reaction. It is found that bilayer fusion reaction is common to all the enveloped viral entry pathways.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the acute disease are still not well understood. Here, we examine the role of Th17 response in the development of the acute hepatitis following infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). We show that IL-17 levels in serum are rapidly elevated and positively correlated to liver damage and death of the mice. In IFN-\u03B3R(\u2212/\u2212) mice, Th17 response is enhanced and the elevated IL-17 production contributes to severe liver damage as well as detrimental inflammation because neutralization of IL-17 effectively suppresses inflammation and protects mice from liver injury. We further show that IFN-\u03B3 facilitates antigen-induced apoptosis of Th17 cells and adoptive transferred IFN-\u03B3R(\u2212/\u2212), but not IFN-\u03B3R(\u002B/\u002B); CD4(\u002B) T cells promotes an enhanced liver damage in wild-type mice.

HRV variants were classified by VP4/VP2 sequencing into 39 genotypically defined types, increasing the current total worldwide to 60. Through sequence comparisons of the 5\u2032untranslated region (5\u2032UTR), the majority grouped with species A (n = 96; 68%, described as HRV-Ca), the remainder forming a phylogenetically distinct 5\u2032UTR group (HRV-Cc). Multiple and bidirectional recombination events between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants and with HRV species A represents the most parsimonious explanation for their interspersed phylogeny relationships in the VP4/VP2-encoding region. No difference in age distribution, seasonality or disease associations was identified between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants. HRV-C-infected subjects showed markedly reduced detection frequencies of RSV and other respiratory viruses, providing evidence for a major interfering effect of HRV-C on susceptibility to other respiratory virus infections. HRV-C\u0027s disease associations, its prevalence and evidence for interfering effects on other respiratory viruses mandates incorporation of rhinoviruses into future diagnostic virology screening.","publish_time":"2009-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wisdom, Anne; Kutkowska, Aldona E.; McWilliam Leitch, E.

It consists of epithelial cells closely connected by intercellular junctions, selective gates which control paracellular diffusion of solutes, ions and macromolecules across the epithelium and keep out pathogens. Rotavirus is one of the major enteric viruses causing severe diarrhea in humans and animals. It specifically infects the enterocytes on villi of small intestines. The polarity of rotavirus replication in their target enterocytes and the role of intestinal epithelial integrity were examined in the present study. Treatment with EGTA, a drug that chelates calcium and disrupts the intercellular junctions, (i) significantly enhanced the infection of rotavirus in primary enterocytes, (ii) increased the binding of rotavirus to enterocytes, but (iii) considerably blocked internalization of rotavirus. After internalization, rotavirus was resistant to EGTA treatment. To investigate the polarity of rotavirus infection, the primary enterocytes were cultured in a transwell system and infected with rotavirus at either the apical or the basolateral surface. Rotavirus preferentially infected enterocytes at the basolateral surface. Restriction of infection through apical inoculation was overcome by EGTA treatment. Overall, our findings demonstrate that integrity of the intestinal epithelium is crucial in the host\u2019s innate defense against rotavirus infection. In addition, the intercellular receptor is located basolaterally and disruption of intercellular junctions facilitates the binding of rotavirus to their receptor at the basolateral surface.","publish_time":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Tingting; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Xie, Jiexiong; Nauwynck, Hans J.","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8b4609286a05e24738b9a4bb5f9b31091fc17fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6924034.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31856906/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-019-0728-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of rotavirus","binding of rotavirus","polarity of rotavirus infection","polarity of rotavirus replication","blocked internalization of rotavirus","infected enterocytes","primary enterocytes","target enterocytes","intercellular receptor","EGTA treatment","basolateral surface","disruption of intercellular junctions","Restriction of infection","Intestinal epithelium functions","role of intestinal epithelial integrity","apical inoculation","epithelial cells","severe diarrhea","host\u2019s innate defense","paracellular diffusion of solutes","selective gates","major enteric viruses","humans","barrier","multicellular organisms","transwell system","macromolecules","calcium","outside world","animals","villi of small intestines","drug","present study","findings","addition","pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, each of the two complete genome sequences of WU (CU_295 and CU_302) and KI (CU_255 and CU_258) polyomaviruses were genetically and phylogenetically characterized. Sequence analysis showed that they contained features common to those found in previous studies. However, there were several nucleotide variations within the non-coding regulatory regions and various non-synonymous mutations within the coding regions which may influence virulence and pathogenesis of these viruses. Nevertheless, it is still possible that these viruses are not the causative agents of clinical respiratory disease. Therefore, judging the association of WU/KI polyomavirus infections with a particular disease will be challenging and require more comprehensive case control investigations.","publish_time":"2008-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Payungporn, Sunchai; Chieochansin, Thaweesak; Thongmee, Chittima; Samransamruajkit, Rujipat; Theamboolers, Apiradee; Poovorawan, Yong","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c5b3948136fbc02afadcaeeb079f2aa4398b81b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172654.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18468712/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2008.03.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170208001305; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170208001305","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["WU"],"organizations":["KI","WU/KI","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","KI polyomaviruses","prevalence of WU","association of WU","respiratory secretions","novel viruses","respiratory viral pathogens","human disease","KI polyomavirus infections","causative agents of clinical respiratory disease","acute respiratory tract infection","frequency of co-detection of WU","complete genome sequences of WU","particular disease","coding regions","human patients","non-coding regulatory regions","Thai pediatric patients","occurrence of co-infection","Thai population","various non-synonymous mutations","nucleotide variations","features common","virulence","nasopharyngeal suction specimens","comprehensive case control investigations","pathogenesis","described PCR assays","Sequence analysis","previous studies","results","study"],"language":"en"},

These disruptions are expected to be of a large scale, such as the disaster of September 11, only 5% of the time; more often than not, disruptions are minor and on a much smaller scale. These smaller disruptions may be due to short-term power outages, fires, disk drive failures, or computer viruses. Regardless, the firm must make a plan based on a thorough analysis of all scenarios that may affect its normal working, and create and test contingency and recovery measures for such situations. This chapter discusses the salient parts of a BCP, which constitutes a strategy for recovering from sudden and unexpected disruption of critical business functionalities. Business continuity and disaster recovery became more important after the occurrence of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York, which led to widespread failure in financial systems. Developing a business continuity and disaster recovery plan requires setting aside resources and treating the development of the plan as a project for the firm. Once the analysis has been conducted and strategies have been formulated, the plan must be tested using simulated emergency scenarios. These scenarios are also important when it comes to industry-wide testing, which has become more of a focus recently as firms in financial sectors across the world become more deeply interlinked. While it is crucial for each firm to have its own business continuity plan, it is just as important for the industry as a whole to protect its infrastructure, since systems of each firm are intricately linked together in an STP environment.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khanna, Ayesha","journal":"Straight Through Processing for Financial Services","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124664708500116; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124664708500116","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["STP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disaster recovery plan","financial business processes","smaller disruptions","Publisher Summary Business continuity planning","financial systems","unforeseen disruptions","BCP","recovery measures","unexpected disruption of critical business functionalities","financial sectors","smaller scale","simulated emergency scenarios","thorough analysis","large scale","industry-wide testing","disk drive failures","fires","short-term power outages","test contingency","New York","widespread failure","computer viruses","firms","resources","terrorist attacks","normal working","salient parts","strategy","focus","world","situations","development","methodology","occurrence","project","chapter","infrastructure","strategies","STP environment","time"],"language":"en"},

This virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as the cellular entry receptor to infect the lower respiratory tract. Because individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of severe COVID19, we determined whether ACE2 expression in the lower airways was related to COPD and cigarette smoking. Methods: Using RNAseq, we determined gene expression levels in bronchial epithelia obtained from cytologic brushings of 6th to 8th generation airways in individuals with and without COPD. We externally validated these results from two additional independent cohorts, which used microarray technologies to measure gene expression levels from 6th to 12th generation airways. Results: In the discovery cohort (n=42 participants), we found that ACE2 expression levels were increased by 48% in the airways of COPD compared with non-COPD subjects (COPD=2.52 (0.66) log2 counts per million reads (CPM) versus non-COPD= 1.70 (0.51) CPM , p=.000762). There was a significant inverse relationship between ACE2 gene expression and FEV1% of predicted (r=negative 0.24; p=0.035). Current smoking also significantly increased ACE2 expression levels compared with never smokers (never current smokers=2.77 (90.91) CPM versus smokers=1.78 (0.39) CPM, p=0.024). These findings were replicated in the two external cohorts. Conclusions: ACE2 expression in lower airways is increased in patients with COPD and with current smoking. These data suggest that these two subgroups are at increased risk of serious COVID19 infection and highlight the importance of smoking cessation in reducing the risk.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, J.

However, evidence on RTI-related healthcare utilisation, especially in primary care, is incomplete. In this retrospective cohort study, we use routinely collected primary and secondary care data to quantify RTI-related healthcare utilisation in children with DS and matched controls without DS. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 992 children with DS and 4874 matched controls attending English general practices and hospitals as identified in Clinical disease research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records (CALIBER) from 1997 to 2010. Poisson regression was used to calculate consultation, hospitalisation and prescription rates, and rate ratios. Wald test was used to compare risk of admission following consultation. The Wilcoxon rank\u2013sum test was used to compare length of stay by RTI type and time-to-hospitalisation. RESULTS: RTI-related healthcare utilisation is significantly higher in children with DS than in controls in terms of GP consultations (adjusted RR 1.73; 95% CI 1.62\u20131.84), hospitalisations (adjusted RR 5.70; 95% CI 4.82\u20136.73), and antibiotic prescribing (adjusted RR 2.34; 95% CI 2.19\u20132.49). Two percent of children with DS presenting for an RTI-related GP consultation were subsequently admitted for an RTI-related hospitalisation, compared to 0.7% in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Children with DS have higher rates of GP consultations, hospitalisations and antibiotic prescribing compared to controls. This poses a significant burden on families. Further research is recommended to characterise healthcare behaviours and clinical decision-making, to optimise care for this at risk group.

The seasonable distribution of the disease suggested that meteorological factors may influence the incidence of mumps. The aim of this study was to explore the possible association between meteorological factors and the incidence of mumps, and to provide scientific evidence to relevant health authorities for the disease control and prevention. Methods We obtained the data of mumps cases and daily meteorological factors in Fujian Province in Eastern China over the period of 2005\u20132013. Using distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) approach, we assessed the relationship between the meteorological factors and mumps incidence. Results The effects of meteorological factors on the mumps incidence were all non-linear. Compared with the lowest risk values, the upper level of precipitation, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity could increase the risk of mumps, whereas the low level of wind velocity, temperature, diurnal temperature range and sunshine duration may also increase the risk. Moderate atmospheric pressure and low wind velocity had larger cumulative effects within 30lagdays and the relative risks were 10.02 (95%CI: 2.47\u201340.71) and 12.45 (95%CI: 1.40\u2013110.78). For temperature, the cumulative effect within 30lagdays of minimum temperature was higher than that from maximum temperature in most populations. The cumulative effects of minimum temperature for males, children aged 10\u201314 and students were higher than those in other populations. Conclusions Meteorological factors, especially temperature and wind velocity, should be taken into consideration in the prevention and warning of possible mumps epidemic. Special attention should be paid to the vulnerable populations, such as teenagers and young adults.","publish_time":"2018-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Wenqi; Li, Yuying; Han, Weixiao; Xue, Li; Zhang, Wenchao; Ma, Wei; Bi, Peng","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5c4304e41fc91be1e2f7817321c5a8e7c250d63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112015.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29734606/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969717331662; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717331662","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Eastern China"],"keyphrases":["incidence of mumps","mumps incidence","risk of mumps","effects of meteorological factors","daily meteorological factors","Conclusions Meteorological factors","maximum temperature","cumulative effects of minimum temperature","lagdays of minimum temperature","data of mumps cases","Abstract Background Mumps","diurnal temperature range","warning of possible mumps epidemic","low wind velocity","low level of wind velocity","larger cumulative effects","prevention","vulnerable populations","Moderate atmospheric pressure","lowest risk values","disease control","relative humidity","possible association","relative risks","upper level of precipitation","relevant health authorities","important public health issue","distributed lag non-linear model","Fujian Province","world","Eastern China","sunshine duration","DLNM","approach","scientific evidence","males","teenagers","children","relationship","period","study","consideration","recent outbreaks","young adults","seasonable distribution","students","Methods","Special attention","aim"],"language":"en"},

In the case of positive-stranded RNA viruses, the ability to translate and, thus, replicate their infecting genome is dependent upon hijacking host proteins. To identify proteins that participate in West Nile virus (WNV) replication, we tested the ability of siRNAs designed to knock-down the expression of a large subset of human genes to interfere with replication of WNV replicons. Here we report that multiple siRNAs for proteasome subunits interfered with WNV genome amplification. Specificity of the interference was shown by demonstrating that silencing proteasome subunits did not interfere with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons. Drugs that blocked proteasome activity were potent inhibitors of WNV genome amplification even if cells were treated 12 h after infection, indicating that the proteasome is required at a post-entry stage(s) of the WNV infection cycle.","publish_time":"2009-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gilfoy, Felicia; Fayzulin, Rafik; Mason, Peter W.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a80751d5415f2d5a22d541111db94909429c89aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103393.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682208007861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19101004/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208007861; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.11.034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV"],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["replication of WNV replicons","WNV infection cycle","proteasome activity","potent inhibitors of WNV genome amplification","silencing proteasome subunits","infecting genome","ability of siRNAs","hijacking host proteins","host cell","multiple siRNAs","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons","West Nile virus","stranded RNA viruses","cells","large subset of human genes","macromolecular synthetic processes","case of positive","post-entry stage","expression","lifecycle of intracellular pathogens","Drugs","interference","Specificity"],"language":"en"},

To clarify the frequency of viral pneumonia among patients with acute progressive clinical courses that required a differential diagnosis between ILDs and pneumonia, and to determine the most frequent ILDs misdiagnosed in cases of viral pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients hospitalized from 2010 to 2017 with an acute clinical course (\u226430 days) who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for the differential diagnosis of infection and ILDs. We performed a multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses using the patients\u0027 preserved BAL fluid. The final diagnosis was made by a multidisciplinary approach and after considering the PCR results. The diagnosis at discharge was compared to the final diagnosis. RESULTS: Among the 109 patients, 53 were diagnosed with viral pneumonia. Viral pneumonia and other diseases showed some differences in symptoms and laboratory data; however, the differences were small or overlapped. Viral pneumonia was misdiagnosed on discharge as acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (AFOP/COP/CEP) (n=22), acute interstitial pneumonia (n=5), connective tissue disease-related ILDs (n=3), unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia (n=2), drug-induced ILD (n=1), and pneumonia (n=20). CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the patients who underwent BAL had viral pneumonia. The most common ILD-related misdiagnoses were AFOP/COP/CEP. Differences in symptoms and laboratory findings between viral pneumonia and other diseases were small, and viral pneumonia should be included in the differential diagnosis when physicians encounter cases in which the abovementioned ILDs are suspected.","publish_time":"2019-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ishiguro, Takashi; Kobayashi, Yasuhito; Uozumi, Ryuji; Takata, Naomi; Takaku, Yotaro; Kagiyama, Naho; Kanauchi, Tetsu; Shimizu, Yoshihiko; Takayanagi, Noboru","journal":"Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d58ccdb0252429f7c74ece67b505a2afd7e08c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6949447.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.2696-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31839671/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL","AFOP/COP/CEP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of viral pneumonia","frequency of viral pneumonia","acute interstitial pneumonia","unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia","cryptogenic organizing pneumonia","chronic eosinophilic pneumonia","chest imaging findings of viral pneumonia","acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia","abovementioned ILDs","frequent ILDs","certain ILDs","final diagnosis","differential diagnosis of infection","differences","acute clinical course","connective tissue disease-related ILDs","interstitial lung diseases","acute progressive clinical courses","AFOP","laboratory findings","clinical characteristics","COP","symptoms","discharge","CEP","PCR results","patients\u0027 preserved BAL fluid","common ILD-related misdiagnoses","laboratory data","multiplex PCR","drug-induced ILD","respiratory viruses","overlap","days","multidisciplinary approach","physicians","bronchoalveolar lavage","OBJECTIVE","half","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Liver impairment of unknown cause is present in 29% of patients with A(H7N9) infection, some of whom experience severe liver injury. Hypoxic hepatitis (HH) is a type of acute severe liver injury characterized by an abrupt, massive increase in serum aminotransferases resulting from anoxic centrilobular necrosis of liver cells. In the intensive care unit (ICU), the prevalence of HH is \u223C1%\u20132%. Here, we report a 1.8% (2/112) incidence of HH in the largest single-centre cohort of ICU patients with A(H7N9) infection. Both HH patients presented with multiple organ failure (MOF) involving respiratory, cardiac, circulatory and renal failure and had a history of chronic heart disease. On admission, severe liver impairment was found. Peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values were 937 and 1281 U/L, and 3117 and 3029 U/L, respectively, in the two patients. Unfortunately, both patients died due to deterioration of MOF. A post-mortem biopsy in case 1 confirmed the presence of centrilobular necrosis of the liver, and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of A(H7N9)-specific genes was negative, which excluded A(H7N9)-related hepatitis. The incidence of HH in A(H7N9) patients is similar to that in ICU patients with other aetiologies. It seems that patients with A(H7N9) infection and a history of chronic heart disease with a low left ventricular ejection fraction on admission are susceptible to HH, which presents as a marked elevation in ALT at the time of admission.","publish_time":"2016-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, YiMin; Liu, JiMin; Yu, Liang; Zhou, Ning; Ding, Wei; Zheng, ShuFa; Shi, Ding; Li, LanJuan","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c481fdcf995099e14997dabd9fe3b47ce8784020.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4735056.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26733380/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hypoxic"],"organizations":["HH","ICU","MOF","ALT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H7N9","HH patients","incidence of HH","severe liver impairment","prevalence of HH","infection","type of acute severe liver injury","largest single-centre cohort of ICU patients","Liver impairment of unknown cause","anoxic centrilobular necrosis of liver cells","ALT","history of chronic heart disease","time of admission","presence of centrilobular necrosis","aspartate aminotransferase","renal failure","deterioration of MOF","Hypoxic hepatitis","related hepatitis","multiple organ failure","Peak alanine aminotransferase","low left ventricular ejection fraction","serum aminotransferases","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","massive increase","case","values","AST","virus","marked elevation","intensive care unit","Avian influenza","specific genes","post-mortem biopsy","aetiologies"],"language":"en"},

Concerns regarding infectious disease outbreaks (SARS, pandemic influenza) have intensified the need to understand public perceptions of quarantine and other social distancing measures. METHODS: We conducted a telephone survey of the general population in the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario, Canada. Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) technology was used. A final sample of 500 individuals was achieved through standard random-digit dialing. RESULTS: Our data indicate strong public support for the use of quarantine when required and for serious legal sanctions against those who fail to comply. This support is contingent both on the implementation of legal safeguards to protect against inappropriate use and on the provision of psychosocial supports for those affected. CONCLUSION: To engender strong public support for quarantine and other restrictive measures, government officials and public health policy-makers would do well to implement a comprehensive system of supports and safeguards, to educate and inform frontline public health workers, and to engage the public at large in an open dialogue on the ethical use of restrictive measures during infectious disease outbreaks.","publish_time":"2009-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tracy, C Shawn; Rea, Elizabeth; Upshur, Ross EG","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6e819e9d3fdfd19cafd2ddf160b9ed2cfd9a27a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2804616.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20015400/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-9-470","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ontario","Canada"],"keyphrases":["use of quarantine","public perceptions of quarantine","strong public support","ethical use of restrictive measures","inappropriate use","public health policy-makers","frontline public health workers","infectious disease outbreaks","social distancing measures","implementation of legal safeguards","telephone interviewing","telephone survey","individual rights","collective rights","serious legal sanctions","provision of psychosocial supports","government officials","Greater Toronto Area","general population","SARS","dynamic interplay","pandemic influenza","sharp relief","need","open dialogue","individuals","Ontario","Canada","CATI","Concerns","data","standard random-digit dialing","hand","citizen","Computer","technology","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","final sample","comprehensive system","community","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Persistent mucosal inflammation is a hallmark of the disease. Epithelial microbiota dysbiosis is found in other chronic inflammatory mucosal diseases; however, the relationship between tracheal microbiota composition and iSGS is unknown. OBJECTIVES: Given the critical role for host defense at mucosal barriers, we analyzed tissue specimens from iSGS patients for the presence of microbial pathogens. METHODS: Utilizing 20 human iSGS, 20 intubation-related tracheal stenosis (iLTS) and 10 healthy control specimens we applied molecular, immunohistochemical, electron microscopic, immunologic and Sanger\u2122 sequencing techniques. MAIN RESULTS: With unbiased culture-independent nucleic acid, protein, and immunologic approaches, we demonstrate that Mycobacterium species are uniquely associated with iSGS. Phylogenetic analysis of the mycobacterial virulence factor rpoB suggests that rather than Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (Mtb), a variant member of the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex (MtbC), or a closely related novel mycobacterium is present in iSGS specimens.

Proteomic profiling indicates an increased expression of CD13 in phagocytes during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of CD13 on the internalization and intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis in monocytes. METHODS: Magnetic nanoparticles and confocal microscopy were used to observe interactions between CD13 and M. tuberculosis. Mycobacterial entry and intracellular survival in monocytes were assessed with and without anti\u2010CD13 antibody (WM15 and WM47) using flow cytometry and colony formation assay. RESULTS: By using magnetic nanoparticles and confocal microscopy, M. tuberculosis was found to be capable of binding to either soluble CD13 or membranous CD13 on monocytes. Flow cytometry showed that pretreatment of monocytes with WM15 or WM47 reduced the number of intracellular M. tuberculosis. Collectively, the data suggest that CD13 is a binding and entry receptor for M. tuberculosis on monocytes. Treatment of infected monocytes showed a greater effect of WM47 than WM15 in reducing the intracellular colonization of M. tuberculosis, suggesting that specific epitopes of CD13 may play an important role modulating intracellular M. tuberculosis survival. CONCLUSIONS: CD13 acts as a receptor for M. tuberculosis on human monocytes. The molecule facilitates internalization, and interaction of CD13 with an anti\u2010CD13 antibody reduces intracellular M. tuberculosis survival.","publish_time":"2013-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Hsin\u2010Tsung; Tsai, I\u2010Fang; Wu, Chien\u2010Liang; Lu, Yen\u2010Ta","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8cb473ae0b7d97fe75a93826c80f335f46008e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169105.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.12191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24011358/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of CD13","tuberculosis survival","soluble CD13","interaction of CD13","membranous CD13","CD13 acts","anti\u2010CD13 antibody","intracellular survival","increased expression of CD13","specific epitopes of CD13","pretreatment of monocytes","human monocytes","Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection","number of intracellular","intracellular colonization","WM15","Treatment of infected monocytes","entry receptor","flow cytometry","confocal microscopy","Magnetic nanoparticles","internalization","greater effect of WM47","important role","capable of binding","Mycobacterial entry","phagocytes","Aminopeptidase N","colony formation assay","outer membrane","OBJECTIVE","ectoenzyme","METHODS","interactions","Proteomic profiling","variety of cells","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","study","molecule","RESULTS","data","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Despite the broad antiviral activity of IFITM3, viruses like Lassa virus (LASV), are fully resistant to its inhibitory effects. It is currently unclear whether resistance arises from a highly efficient fusion machinery that is capable of overcoming IFITM3 restriction or the ability to enter from cellular sites devoid of this factor. Here, we constructed and validated a functional IFITM3 tagged with EGFP or other fluorescent proteins. This breakthrough allowed live cell imaging of virus co-trafficking and fusion with endosomal compartments in cells expressing fluorescent IFITM3. Three-color single virus and endosome tracking revealed that sensitive (IAV), but not resistant (LASV), viruses become trapped within IFITM3-positive endosomes where they underwent hemifusion but failed to release their content into the cytoplasm. IAV fusion with IFITM3-containing compartments could be rescued by amphotericin B treatment, which has been previously shown to antagonize the antiviral activity of this protein. By comparison, virtually all LASV particles trafficked and fused with endosomes lacking detectable levels of fluorescent IFITM3, implying that this virus escapes restriction by utilizing endocytic pathways that are distinct from the IAV entry pathways. The importance of virus uptake and transport pathways is further reinforced by the observation that LASV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion is inhibited by IFITM3 and other members of the IFITM family expressed in target cells. Together, our results strongly support a model according to which IFITM3 accumulation at the sites of virus fusion is a prerequisite for its antiviral activity and that this protein traps viral fusion at a hemifusion stage by preventing the formation of fusion pores. We conclude that the ability to utilize alternative endocytic pathways for entry confers IFITM3-resistance to otherwise sensitive viruses.","publish_time":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suddala, Krishna C.; Lee, Christine C.; Meraner, Paul; Marin, Mariana; Markosyan, Ruben M.; Desai, Tanay M.; Cohen, Fredric S.; Brass, Abraham L.; Melikyan, Gregory B.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b25bae266584f12c3b5af9e5cf3e81c84808c36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6347298.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640957/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007532","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFP","LASV","IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFITM3-resistance","IFITM3 accumulation","functional IFITM3","IAV fusion","sites of virus fusion","IFITM3-positive endosomes","broad antiviral activity of IFITM3","fusion of diverse viruses","Lassa virus","detectable levels of fluorescent IFITM3","capable of overcoming IFITM3 restriction","LASV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion","virus escapes restriction","efficient fusion machinery","formation of fusion pores","IAV entry pathways","protein traps viral fusion","Three-color single virus","importance of virus uptake","sensitive viruses","transport pathways","LASV particles","live cell imaging of virus co-trafficking","alternative endocytic pathways","ability","transmembrane protein","fluorescent proteins","endosomal compartments","endosome tracking","hemifusion stage","target cells","cellular sites devoid","Late endosome-resident interferon","observation","Influenza","prerequisite","IFITM family","breakthrough","EGFP","factor","model","members","amphotericin B treatment","content","inhibitory effects","comparison","understood mechanism","cytoplasm","results"],"language":"en"},

The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches, 2 of which include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (\u002B) RNA and double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (\u2212) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from \u002BRNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas -RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of \u002BRNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, particularly, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy. The majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent advances of metagenomics have led to the discovery of many new groups of RNA viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings enable a far more complete reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than what was attainable previously. This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore Classes of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related hosts, such as plants and animals. These results call for a major revision of the existing taxonomy of RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wolf, Yuri I.; Kazlauskas, Darius; Iranzo, Jaime; Luc\u00CDa-Sanz, Adriana; Kuhn, Jens H.; Krupovic, Mart; Dolja, Valerian V.; Koonin, Eugene V.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6e5c7919fa1f35244c27ef7e31f6b5817211b66.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b6834722e073758e71732fc83979fb6a49f20333.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/451740","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolution of RNA viruses","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","positive-sense RNA viruses","existing taxonomy of RNA viruses","new groups of RNA viruses","RNA virus taxonomy","dsRNA viruses","RNA virus RdRps","diverse viruses","Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution","global RNA virome","distinct RNA helicases","extensive transfer of viruses","replication of larger RNA genomes","different Baltimore Classes of viruses","RdRp tree","horizontal virus transfer","virus genome expression","virus-host interactions","RdRp phylogenetic tree construction","Subsequent evolution","resulting tree","tree topology","related hosts","major branches","complete reconstruction","detailed phylogenomic reconstruction","major revision","eukaryotic virome","negative-sense","plants","animals","wide range of hosts","Recent advances of metagenomics","recent advances of metaviromics","extensive gene module exchange","independent occasions","universal gene","Phylogenomic analysis","mix of positive","present results","network of evolutionary relationships","independent capture of additional genes","refinement","numerous human","thorough reevaluation","eukaryotes","enormous diversity","underlying multiple sequence alignments","single jelly","common ancestors","iterative computational procedure","discovery","scaffold","plant pathogens","capsid protein","majority","findings"],"language":"en"},

In Experiment 1, apparent fat absorption (AFA) was significantly higher (P \u003C 0.05) for control (85.9%) than for M (78.5%) and S (78.3%) groups, and AME, for the control group was significantly higher than all the PEMS-survivor groups. In Experiment 2, Group L had a higher AFA and AMEn than Group S. AFA and AMEn improved in both groups over time. The digestive capabilities of PEMS survivors were depressed proportionally to the degree of stunting. Impaired fat digestibility and dietary energy utilization in PEMS-afflicted birds are likely contributors to stunted growth and reduced recovery rates.","publish_time":"2001-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Odetallah, N.

Medical providers, teams, and organizations have needed to shift their visits away from face-to-face visits and toward telehealth (both by phone and through video). Palliative care teams who practice in the community setting are faced with a difficult task: How do we actively triage the most urgent visits while keeping our vulnerable patients safe from the pandemic? MEASURES: The following are recommendations created by the Palo Alto Medical Foundation Palliative Care and Support Services team to help triage and coordinate for timely, safe, and effective palliative care in the community and outpatient setting during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Patients are initially triaged based on location followed by acuity. Interdisciplinary care is implemented using strict infection control guidelines in the setting of limited personal protective equipment resources. We implement thorough screening for COVID-19 symptoms at multiple levels before a patient is seen by a designated provider. CONCLUSIONS/LESSONS LEARNED: We recommend active triaging, communication, and frequent screening for COVID-19 symptoms for palliative care patients been evaluated in the community setting. An understanding of infection risk, mutual consent between designated providers, patients, and their families are crucial to maintaining safety while delivering community-based palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tran, David L.; Lai, Steve R.; Salah, Ramy Y.; Wong, Angela Y.; Bryon, Jill N.; McKenna, Meghan C.; Chan, Yvonne K.","journal":"J Pain Symptom Manage","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.03.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32276099/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["palliative care patients","Palliative care teams","effective palliative care","community setting","pandemic","Interdisciplinary care","ongoing COVID","Palo Alto Medical Foundation Palliative Care","Medical providers","vulnerable patients safe","symptoms","medical system","designated providers","face-to-face visits","urgent visits","setting of limited personal protective equipment resources","frequent screening","thorough screening","unprecedented shift","understanding of infection risk","strict infection control guidelines","mutual consent","Support Services team","recommendations","communication","outpatient","active triaging","families","multiple levels","safety","organizations","LESSONS","following","telehealth","coronavirus disease","difficult task","phone","CONTEXT","MEASURES","location","video","acuity","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Lung infection is a common clinical feature and contributes to disease severity as well as viral transmission. Animal models are often required to study viral infections and therapies, especially during an initial outbreak. Histopathology studies allow for identification of lesions and affected cell types to better understand viral pathogenesis and clarify effective therapies. Use of immunostaining allows detection of presumed viral receptors and viral tropism for cells can be evaluated to correlate with lesions. In the lung, lesions and immunostaining can be qualitatively described to define the cell types, microanatomic location, and type of changes seen. These features are important and necessary, but this approach can have limitations when comparing treatment groups. Semiquantitative and quantitative tissue scores are more rigorous as these provide the ability to statistically compare groups and increase the reproducibility and rigor of the study.

At the two time points, group A rotavirus was detected in 8.6% and 16.2% of the adolescents and 5.2% and 17.2% of the adults, respectively. Reverse transcription\u2010PCR with consensus primers followed by multiplex genotyping PCR detected common strains G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], and G4P[8] in a total of 53.1% of the samples from 1993 to 1996, while the only prevalent strain identified in 2004\u20132007 was G2P[4] (23.5% of total). Uncommon rotavirus strains (G1P[4], G2P[8] G9P[6]/P[4]) increased from 7.8% (1993\u20131996) to 41.2% (2004\u20132007), while the prevalence of mixed rotavirus infections was high (39%/35%) at both time points. Mixed infections detected by multiplex PCR were confirmed by sequencing two or more individual genotype\u2010specific PCR products of the VP7 and VP4 genes from the same sample. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences showed circulation of a heterogeneous rotavirus strain population comprising genotypes G1 (lineages I and IIb), G2 (lineages I and IIb), G4 (lineage Ia), P[4] (lineages P[4]\u20105 and P[4]\u20101), P[8] (lineages P[8]\u2010II and P[8]\u2010III), and P[6] (M37\u2010like lineage). The VP6 gene sequences of the nontypeable strains were most homologous to animal strains. This study documents the molecular epidemiology of rotavirus strains in adolescents and adults in India, and suggests that it may be important to monitor these strains over time for the potential impact on rotavirus vaccines under development for use in the Indian population.

In the majority of cases, the cause of the fever is unknown. Although respiratory viruses are commonly associated with this condition, the etiologic significance of this finding remains unclear and is therefore the subject of this study. STUDY DESIGN: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected during 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia in children age 0\u201318 years, being treated at a children\u2019s oncology unit between January 2013 and June 2014. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the presence of 16 respiratory viruses. Follow-up samples were collected from children who tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Rhinoviruses were genotyped by VP4/VP2 sequencing. Fisher\u2019s exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for group comparisons. RESULTS: At least one respiratory virus was detected in samples from 39 of 87 episodes of febrile neutropenia (45%), with rhinoviruses the most frequently detected. Follow-up samples were collected after a median of 28 days (range, 9\u201374 days) in 32 of the 39 virus-positive episodes. The respiratory viral infection had resolved in 25 episodes (78%). The same virus was detected at follow-up in one coronavirus and six rhinovirus episodes. Genotyping revealed a different rhinovirus species in two of the six rhinovirus infections. CONCLUSION: The frequency of respiratory viral infections in this group of patients suggests an etiologic role in febrile neutropenia. However, these findings must be confirmed in larger patient cohorts.","publish_time":"2016-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00F6derman, Martina; Rhedin, Samuel; Tolfvenstam, Thomas; Rotz\u00E9n-\u00D6stlund, Maria; Albert, Jan; Broliden, Kristina; Lindblom, Anna","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3c04715d99a379da9cf526b7542f027cf0a04c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4911076.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27309354/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0157398","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","episodes of febrile neutropenia","rhinovirus episodes","virus-positive episodes","Follow-up samples","frequency of respiratory viral infections","rhinovirus infections","children age","days","Rhinoviruses","different rhinovirus species","group of patients","etiologic role","etiologic significance","group comparisons","STUDY DESIGN","Fisher\u2019s exact test","Mann-Whitney U test","chemotherapy","cause","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","median","Real-time polymerase chain reaction","fever","VP4","Genotyping","years","range","condition","CONCLUSION","presence","OBJECTIVE","coronavirus","larger patient cohorts","majority of cases","VP2 sequencing","treatment of malignancies","children\u2019s oncology unit","findings","subject","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

It is known that production of inhibitory factors may result in the inability of the host to clear viruses, resulting in chronic viral persistence. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) has been identified as a novel effector molecule of CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B) Foxp3(\u002B) regulatory T (Treg) cells that inhibits immune activity by binding to FC\u03B3RIIB expressed primarily on antigen presenting cells (APC). In this study, we show that infection of mice with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus WE (LCMV WE) leads to increased plasma levels of FGL2, which were detected as early as 2 days post-infection (pi) and persisted until day 50 pi. Mice deficient in FGL2 (fgl2(\u2212/\u2212)) had increased viral titers of LCMV WE in the liver early p.i but cleared the virus by day 12 similar to wild type mice. Dendritic cells (DC) isolated from the spleens of LCMV WE infected fgl2(\u2212/\u2212) had increased expression of the DC maturation markers CD80 and MHC Class II compared to wild type (fgl2(\u002B/\u002B)). Frequencies of CD8(\u002B) and CD4(\u002B) T cells producing IFN\u03B3 in response to ex vivo peptide re-stimulation isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes were also increased in LCMV WE infected fgl2 (\u2212/\u2212) mice. Increased frequencies of CD8(\u002B) T cells specific for LCMV tetramers GP(33) and NP(396) were detected within the liver of fgl2(\u2212/\u2212) mice. Plasma from fgl2(\u2212/\u2212) mice contained higher titers of total and neutralizing anti-LCMV antibody. Enhanced anti-viral immunity in fgl2(\u2212/\u2212) mice was associated with increased levels of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), hepatic necrosis and inflammation following LCMV WE infection. These data demonstrate that targeting FGL2 leads to early increased viral replication but enhanced anti-viral adaptive T \u0026 B cell responses.

There is still uncertainty around the scale and duration of this exposure event. This has implications for the estimated transmissibility of the coronavirus and as such, these potential scenarios should be explored. Methods: We used a stochastic branching process model, parameterised with available data where possible and otherwise informed by the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, to simulate the Wuhan outbreak. We evaluated scenarios for the following parameters: the size, and duration of the initial transmission event, the serial interval, and the reproduction number (R0). We restricted model simulations based on the number of observed cases on the 25th of January, accepting samples that were within a 5% interval on either side of this estimate. Results: Using a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval suggested a larger initial transmission event and a higher R0 estimate. Using a SARs-like serial interval we found that the most likely scenario produced an R0 estimate between 2-2.7 (90% credible interval (CrI)). A pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in an R0 estimate between 2-3 (90% CrI). There were other plausible scenarios with smaller events sizes and longer duration that had comparable R0 estimates. There were very few simulations that were able to reproduce the observed data when R0 was less than 1. Conclusions: Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported. We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration. Scenarios with a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in a higher R0 and were equally plausible to scenarios with SARs-like serial intervals.","publish_time":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abbott, Sam; Hellewell, Joel; Munday, James; Funk, Sebastian","journal":"Wellcome Open Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94475eaa419b11d7edf53c2fe4e423acef0ce881.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156988.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15718.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32322691/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs2ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["higher R0 estimate","comparable R0 estimates","initial exposure event","pre-intervention SARS","credible interval","plausible scenarios","serial intervals","potential scenarios","decreasing event size","larger initial transmission event","point-source exposure event","longer duration","Wuhan outbreak","observed data","model simulations","Results","CrI","current novel coronavirus outbreak","number of observed cases","available data","reproduction number","stochastic branching process model","Huanan seafood wholesale market","smaller events sizes","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","China","Background","scale","following parameters","estimated transmissibility","likely scenario","implications","Methods","uncertainty","Conclusions","samples"],"language":"en"},

The present study investigated the genotypic relationship between CK/CH/LDL/97I-type strains and reference IBVs based on S1 gene comparisons and the protection provided by vaccination with commercial vaccines and attenuated homologous and heterologous strains. Phylogenetic analysis and the comparison of S1 showed that CK/CH/LDL/97I-type virus might be a new serotype compared to vaccine strains and other types of IBV isolates in China. Protection efficacy was evaluated by morbidity, mortality, and virus re-isolation from the challenged chicks. Complete protection by IBV vaccination was provided by the homologous strain but sufficient respiratory protection was not provided by the commercial vaccines.

The majority of these infections in children are of viral etiology. In this study, we evaluated the incidence of viral ARI among children in Lebanon. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children presenting with symptoms of ARI were prospectively recruited between September 2009 to February 2012. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from patients and screened for 11 respiratory viruses using a multiplex Luminex-based PCR assay. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-one patients were recruited with a median age of 1 year (IQR: 0 \u2013 5). Out of 221 patients, 116 (52.5%) were positive for at least one virus, the majority (103/116; 88.8%) of which were in children under 6-year of age. Overall, 188 viruses were detected. Rhinovirus (RhV) was the most common virus detected in 81 (69.8%) patients followed by coxsackie virus and echovirus (CVEV) which were detected as one target in the panel in 45 (38.8%), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV types: 1, 2, 3, 4) in 24 (20.7%) patients. Coinfection with more than one virus was detected in 49 (42.9%) patients. RhV and CVEV were the most common viruses associated with co-infections and higher risk of rhinorrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Viral pathogens account for at least half of the ARIs in Lebanon, with a high frequency of co-infections being detected.","publish_time":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Masoud, Khaldoun; Hanna-Wakim, Rima; Zaraket, Hassan; Kharroubi, Samer; Araj, George F; Matar, Ghassan M; Dbaibo, Ghassan","journal":"Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14e878a6400d8320e2c781a76edc4a14f4cec1df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6827722.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4084/mjhid.2019.059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31700584/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARI","CVEV"],"locations":["Lebanon"],"keyphrases":["PATIENTS","children","respiratory viruses","common viruses","parainfluenza viruses","coxsackie virus","Acute respiratory infections","incidence of viral ARI","high frequency of co-infections","symptoms of ARI","Lebanon","viral etiology","CVEV","year of age","RhV","majority","Viral pathogens account","median age","multiplex Luminex-based PCR assay","half","higher risk of rhinorrhea","ARIs","BACKGROUND","echovirus","leading cause of death","CONCLUSIONS","PIV types","IQR","METHODS","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","target","panel","study","Rhinovirus","Coinfection","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Efficient utilization of health resources requires information regarding the trends of TJR. This study investigated the association of TJR with the demographic characteristics in Taiwan from 1998 to 2009. It also estimated the demand for total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) in the next two decades. Methods International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) procedure codes were used to identify the data for primary and revision TKRs and THRs between the years 1998 and 2009 from Taiwan\u0027s National Health Insurance Research Database. Age- and sex-specific rates of such procedures were calculated. The trend in TJR rate and its future estimation were studied with regression analyses. Results From 1998 to 2009, the number of primary TKRs increased by 99.1% and that of primary THRs increased by 11.3%. The number of revision TKRs increased by 3.1% and that of revision THRs decreased by 13.2%. Compared with their respective rates in 2005, the rates of primary TKR and primary THR were projected to increase by 508.2% and 69.7%, respectively, in 2030. The rate of revision TKR was predicted to increase by 75.3% and that of revision THR to decrease by 36.1%. Conclusion This study gives an insight into the current status burden of TJR in Taiwan. TJR rate projection would be useful for future planning of budget and resources for TJR in Taiwan.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Atul; Tsai, Wen-Chen; Tan, Tai-Sheng; Kung, Pei-Tseng; Chiu, Li-Ting; Ku, Ming-Chou","journal":"Journal of the Chinese Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2ade240ec3aed8001f7dc072f107e0bc91b679e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105048.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26318767/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1726490115001501; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1726490115001501; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcma.2015.06.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TJR","National Health Insurance Research Database","THR","TKR"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["association of TJR","trends of TJR","primary THRs","revision THRs","TJR rate projection","rates of primary TKR","rate of revision TKR","number of primary TKRs","number of revision TKRs","total knee replacement","total hip replacement","total expenditures","current status burden of TJR","Abstract Background Total joint replacement","health care","respective rates","study","Efficient utilization of health resources","sex-specific rates","future estimation","future planning of budget","Taiwan\u0027s National Health Insurance Research Database","information","accounts","substantial proportion","insight","years","ICD","demographic characteristics","demand","Methods International Classification of Diseases","regression analyses","Age","procedures","procedure codes","Conclusion","decades","Results"],"language":"en"},

STAT1 is a 91 kDa protein originally identified as the mediator of the cellular response to interferon (IFN) \u03B1, and thereafter found to be a major component of the cellular response to IFN\u03B3. STAT1 is, in fact, involved in the response to several cytokines and to growth factors. It is activated by cytokine receptors via kinases of the JAK family. STAT1 becomes phosphorylated and forms a dimer which enters the nucleus and triggers the transcription of its targets. Although not lethal at birth, selective gene deletion of STAT1 in mice leads to rapid death from severe infections, demonstrating its major role in the response to pathogens. Similarly, in humans who do not express STAT1, there is a lack of resistance to pathogens leading to premature death. This indicates a key, non-redundant function of STAT1 in the defence against pathogens. Thus, to successfully infect organisms, bacterial, viral or parasitic pathogens must overcome the activity of STAT1, and almost all the steps of this pathway can be blocked or inhibited by proteins produced in infected cells. Interestingly, some pathogens, like the oncogenic Epstein\u2013Barr virus, have evolved a strategy which uses STAT1 activation.","publish_time":"2010-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Najjar, Imen; Fagard, Remi","journal":"Biochimie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ea11c607b7db58cb8fba01c3fe50d4348cf60f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117016.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2010.02.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20159032/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300908410000532; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300908410000532","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JAK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["express STAT1","Abstract STAT1","activity of STAT1","STAT1 activation","selective gene deletion of STAT1","non-redundant function of STAT1","cellular response","parasitic pathogens","STAT family of transcription factors","growth factors","rapid death","major role","JAK family","major component","premature death","mice","STAT4","STAT3","severe infections","STAT5A","birth","mediator","interferon","STAT2","Barr virus","STAT5B","kinases","oncogenic Epstein","strategy","key","lack of resistance","defence","cytokine receptors","organisms","STAT6","dimer","kDa protein","IFN\u03B3","cytokines","proteins","infected cells","nucleus","steps","humans","pathway","targets"],"language":"en"},

This research views such spreads as geo-social interaction problems, because population mobility connects different groups of people over geographical locations via which the viruses transmit. Previous research argued that geo-social interaction patterns identified from population movement data can provide great potential in designing effective pandemic mitigation. However, little work has been done to examine the effectiveness of designing control strategies taking into account geo-social interaction patterns. METHODS: To address this gap, this research proposes a new framework for effective disease control; specifically this framework proposes that disease control strategies should start from identifying geo-social interaction patterns, designing effective control measures accordingly, and evaluating the efficacy of different control measures. This framework is used to structure design of a new visual analytic tool that consists of three components: a reorderable matrix for geo-social mixing patterns, agent-based epidemic models, and combined visualization methods. RESULTS: With real world human interaction data in a French primary school as a proof of concept, this research compares the efficacy of vaccination strategies between the spatial\u2013social interaction patterns and the whole areas. The simulation results show that locally targeted vaccination has the potential to keep infection to a small number and prevent spread to other regions. At some small probability, the local control strategies will fail; in these cases other control strategies will be needed. This research further explores the impact of varying spatial\u2013social scales on the success of local vaccination strategies. The results show that a proper spatial\u2013social scale can help achieve the best control efficacy with a limited number of vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: The case study shows how GS-EpiViz does support the design and testing of advanced control scenarios in airborne disease (e.g., influenza). The geo-social patterns identified through exploring human interaction data can help target critical individuals, locations, and clusters of locations for disease control purposes. The varying spatial\u2013social scales can help geographically and socially prioritize limited resources (e.g., vaccines).","publish_time":"2016-08-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Wei","journal":"Int J Health Geogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77907b0bbf75ae10794ca69d97b9874159db1857.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4980799.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12942-016-0059-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27510908/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["geo-social patterns","disease control strategies","geo-social interaction problems","account geo-social interaction patterns","social scales","local control strategies","effective disease control","geo-social mixing patterns","disease control purposes","effective control measures","best control efficacy","efficacy of different control measures","efficacy of vaccination strategies","airborne disease","testing of advanced control scenarios","real world human interaction data","success of local vaccination strategies","Previous research","population mobility","new framework","population movement data","impact of varying spatial","design","clusters of locations","geographical locations","targeted vaccination","small number","limited number of vaccines","simulation results","effective pandemic mitigation","great potential","small probability","limited resources","different groups of people","combined visualization methods","new visual analytic tool","French primary school","epidemic models","reorderable matrix","agent","critical individuals","spatio-temporal course","components","proof of concept","spreads","GS-EpiViz","case study","infection","BACKGROUND","gap","cases","areas","CONCLUSIONS","viruses","regions","influenza","effectiveness","little work"],"language":"en"},

After the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, recently diagnosed novel betacoronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 has spread across 203 countries and territories in all 5 major continents. World Health Organization (WHO) declared this as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Subsequently on February 11, 2020 a new name was given to this disease i.e. COVID-19 by an expert group from WHO. As of April 12, 2020, 10:00 CET, GMT\u002B2:00, 1,696,588 confirmed cases and 105,952 confirmed deaths have been reported to the WHO. (Coronavirus disease 2019, situation report 83). It possibly originated from a small animal market in Wuhan, China. A cluster of patients were admitted with unusual pneumonia not responding to treatment in various hospitals. Epidemiological, genomic analysis and correlation with other coronaviruses led to the isolation of new coronavirus, closely resembling the bat coronaviruses, from such patients in Wuhan. They were identified as the SARS-CoV-2. This virus infection presents as influenza like illness in the affected people. Fever, cough, respiratory distress with fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are common symptoms seen in adults. This may progress on to respiratory distress, hypoxia, need for oxygen supplementation and ventilator support as seen in patients in the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2003) in Guangdong, China. The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-1 was less as compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it was well controlled with good public health efforts. The present COVID-19 epidemic is still in the acceleration phase of 3 and 4 in various countries. Without any effective antiviral agents available at present, the need of the hour is early case detection, isolation of cases, use of good preventive care measures by the household contacts and in the hospital set up. The results of ongoing clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin alone or in combination and a new antiviral agent remdesivir may help to treat some of the infections. A need for effective vaccine is being seen an as good preventive strategy in this pandemic. However the results of clinical trials and incorporation of vaccines in public health programs is a long way to go.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaul, Dinesh","journal":"Curr Med Res Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74e8420500aa12efcaf64b034fed63ff0b231bc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194867.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmrp.2020.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352081720300398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363221/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352081720300398","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","isolation of new coronavirus","epidemic","Coronavirus disease","Coronavirus infections","need","transmissibility of SARS","good public health efforts","public health programs","respiratory distress","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","isolation of cases","confirmed cases","results of clinical trials","good preventive strategy","public health emergency of international concern","pandemic threats","present COVID","World Health Organization","H1N1 influenza pandemic","cluster of patients","Wuhan","China","various countries","good preventive care measures","results of ongoing clinical trials","new antiviral agent remdesivir","bat coronaviruses","effective antiviral agents available","confirmed deaths","effective vaccine","various hospitals","incorporation of vaccines","vomiting","nausea","combination","fatigue","diarrhea","hydroxychloroquine","novel betacoronavirus","hour","early case detection","household contacts","illness","azithromycin","common symptoms","oxygen supplementation","treatment","genomic analysis","correlation","ventilator support","small animal market","unusual pneumonia","hypoxia","cough","long way","adults","territories","affected people","GMT","Fever","situation report","major continents","acceleration phase","expert group","decades","Guangdong","CET"],"language":"en"},

In the time that has passed since, additional ER domains have been discovered and characterized. These include the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), the ER quality control compartment (ERQC), where ER-associated degradation (ERAD) occurs, and the plasma membrane-associated membrane (PAM). Insight has been gained into the separation of nuclear envelope proteins from the remainder of the ER. Research has also shown that the biogenesis of peroxisomes and lipid droplets occurs on specialized membranes of the ER. Several studies have shown the existence of specific marker proteins found on all these domains and how they are targeted there. Moreover, a first set of cytosolic ER-associated sorting proteins, including phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS-2) and Rab32 have been identified. Intra-ER targeting mechanisms appear to be superimposed onto ER retention mechanisms and rely on transmembrane and cytosolic sequences.

In this paper, an implicit biological membrane environment has been constructed in lattice space, in which the lipid chains and water molecules were represented by the unoccupied lattice sites. The biological membrane was characterized with three features: stronger hydrogen bonding interaction, membrane lateral pressure, and lipophobicity index for the amino acid residues. In addition to the hydrocarbon core spanning region and the water solution, the lipid interface has also been represented in this implicit membrane environment, which was proved to be effective for the transmembrane protein\u0027s folding. The associated Monte Carlo simulations have been performed for SARS-CoV E protein and M2 protein segment (residues 18\u201360) of influenza A virus. It was found that the coil\u2013helix transition of the transmembrane segment occurred earlier than the coil\u2013globule transition of the two terminal domains. The folding process and final orientation of the amphipathic helical block in water solution are obviously influenced by its corresponding hydrophobicity/lipophobicity. Therefore, this implicit membrane environment, though in lattice space, can make an elaborate balance between different driving forces for the membrane protein\u0027s folding, thus offering a potential means for the simulation of transmembrane protein oligomers in feasible time.","publish_time":"2010-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yantao; Wang, Mingliang; Zhang, Qianling; Liu, Jianhong","journal":"Biophysical Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a9093854e8516041c2c38b8172e3ba5e1541403.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117040.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20079964/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpc.2009.12.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301462209002440; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301462209002440","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["implicit membrane environment","implicit biological membrane environment","complexity of biological membrane","membrane lateral pressure","transmembrane segment","computer simulation of transmembrane protein\u0027s folding","simulation of transmembrane protein oligomers","water solution","lattice space","folding process","M2 protein segment","water molecules","coil","unoccupied lattice sites","SARS-CoV E protein","lipophobicity index","globule transition","helix transition","lipid chains","lipid interface","amino acid residues","stronger hydrogen bonding interaction","different driving forces","amphipathic helical block","final orientation","features","hydrocarbon core spanning region","elaborate balance","potential means","feasible time","addition","paper","associated Monte Carlo simulations","terminal domains","corresponding hydrophobicity","influenza","virus"],"language":"en"},

These mutants failed to efficiently infect BHK cells expressing CEACAM1b (BHK-R2), due to their low entry into this cell line, although they infected cells expressing CEACAM1a (BHK-R1) in a manner similar to that of wild-type (wt) JHMV cl-2 (Matsuyama and Taguchi, Virology 273, 80\u201389, 2000). Following the repeated passage of these mutants through BHK-R2 cells, viruses were no longer isolated from srr11-infected cells, while two distinct mutants, srr7A and srr7B, were obtained from srr7-infected cells. Srr7A and srr7B grew 2 log10 higher than srr7 and induced fusion in BHK-R2 cells, being similar to wt virus. In addition to the amino acid change at position 1114 that stemmed from parental srr7, srr7A and srr7B had mutations around position 280, corresponding to the third region of the S1N330 receptor-binding site (S1N330-III) common to all MHV strains examined thus far. Srr7A and srr7B S proteins showed high fusogenicity in both BHK-R1 and BHK-R2 cells, like the wt virus, while srr7Aa and srr7Ba S proteins, which had mutations in S1N330-III but not at amino acid 1114, exhibited profoundly reduced fusion activity in these cell lines. These findings suggest that communication between S1N330-III and the amino acid at position 1114 is important for efficient fusion activity in BHK-R2 cells. S1N330-III is a possible region in the S1 involved in viral entry into cells.","publish_time":"2002-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matsuyama, Shutoku; Taguchi, Fumihiro","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/110f5cd40aa0ff4381f7abc3cabbc629f9794e66.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682202913917; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682202913917","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BHK","JHMV","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BHK cells","BHK-R2 cells","srr7-infected cells","BHK-R1","srr11-infected cells","srr7B S proteins","wt virus","amino acid mutation","amino acid change","parental srr7","distinct mutants","S1N330 receptor-binding site","induced fusion","JHMV","efficient fusion activity","srr7Ba S proteins","mutations","Leu","mouse hepatitis virus","manner similar","MHV strains","low entry","viral entry","possible region","cell lines","soluble receptor-resistant","high fusogenicity","log10 higher","murine coronavirus","positions","srr7Aa","wild-type","viruses","CEACAM1b","Matsuyama","Phe","addition","repeated passage","CEACAM1a","Taguchi","Virology","spike","findings","communication"],"language":"en"},

Understanding reasons for nonadherence to crisis guidelines is needed to improve crisis management. We identified and measured barriers and conditions for optimal adherence as perceived by 4 categories of health care professionals.

The groups were asked to appraise barriers encountered during 4 outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], Clostridium difficile ribotype 027, rubella, and avian influenza) according to a 5-point Likert scale. When at least 33% of the participants responded \u201Cstrongly agree,\u201D \u201Cagree,\u201D or \u201Crather agree than disagree,\u201D a barrier was defined as \u201Coften experienced.\u201D The common (\u201Cgeneric\u201D) barriers were included in a univariate and multivariate model.

The cross-sectional study also yielded profession-specific sets of often-experienced barriers. Conclusion To improve adherence to crisis guidelines, the generic barriers should be addressed when developing guidelines, irrespective of the infectious agent.

For the case with windward pollutant emission at the 3rd floor within a re-entry, the pollutant migrated downwards due to the downwash created by the wind.

Objective: The purposes of this study were to assess the occurrence of RV, enterovirus, and coronavirus infections in wheezing infants and to evaluate the association of these viral findings with early school-age asthma. Methods: In 1999, outcome in relation to asthma was studied in 82 of 100 initially recruited children who had been hospitalized for wheezing in infancy during the period 1992-1993. In 2000, etiologic viral studies regarding the index episode of wheezing were supplemented by rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus detection by RT-PCR from frozen nasopharyngeal aspirates in 81 of the children for whom adequate samples were available. Of these children, 66 had participated in the follow-up in 1999. Results: Rhinoviruses were identified in 27 (33%) of the 81 children, enteroviruses in 10 (12%), and coronaviruses in none. Rhinoviruses were present as single viral findings in 22 (81%) of the 27 rhinovirus-positive cases, and rhinovirus infections were associated with the presence of atopic dermatitis in infancy. Enteroviruses were commonly encountered in mixed infections and had no association with atopy. As single viral findings, rhinoviruses were associated with the development of asthma (P = .047; odds ratio, 4.14; 95% CI, 1.02-16.77 versus rhinovirus-negative cases [by logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and atopic dermatitis on entry)]. Conclusion: Our results present rhinoviruses as important inducers of wheezing even in infancy. The association with atopy and subsequent asthma calls for reevaluation of the role of rhinoviruses in the development of asthma.

The aim of this study was to explore the post-crisis psychological distress among residents in Taiwan after the SARS epidemic. Methods The target population consisted of a nationwide representative sample of residents aged \u2265 18 years. Data were collected using computer assisted telephone interview systems by stratified random sampling according to geographic area. The survey (n = 1278) was conducted in November 2003, about 4 months after resolution of the SARS crisis in Taiwan. The maximum deviation of sampling error at the 95% confidence level was \u00B1 2.74%. Psychological distress was measured by a question related to subject\u0027s changes in perception of life, plus the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the correlation of psychological distress. Results About 9.2% of the participants reported that their perceptions of life became more pessimistic following the SARS crisis. The prevalence of psychiatric morbidity was 11.7%. Major predictors of higher levels of pessimism after the SARS epidemic included demographic factors, perception of SARS and preparedness, knowing people or having personal experiences of SARS-related discrimination, and individual worries and psychiatric morbidity. The correlates of symptomatic cases, as indicated by the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale, included age \u2265 50 years, senior high school graduate, and worries about recurrence of SARS. Conclusion Psychological distress was significantly correlated with demographic factors and perception regarding the SARS epidemic. It is suggested that marketing of mental health education should be segmented according to age and education level, which should enhance crisis communication for newly emerging infectious diseases among community populations.","publish_time":"2010-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Eugene Yu-Chang; Lee, Ming-Been; Tsai, Shang-Ta; Yang, Chih-Chien; Morisky, Donald Edward; Tsai, Liang-Ting; Weng, Ya-Ling; Lyu, Shu-Yu","journal":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3476310f16e515bb1fdeef6da542380370f5e655.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f493291354421497889bb288a24c64b51919fce1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664610600873; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664610600873; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0929-6646(10)60087-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20654792/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3106105?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["SARS crisis","perception of SARS","SARS epidemic","recurrence of SARS","personal experiences of SARS","post-crisis psychological distress","Taiwan","correlation of psychological distress","Conclusion Psychological distress","crisis communication","perception of life","demographic factors","age","item Brief Symptom Rating Scale","years","education level","prevalence of psychiatric morbidity","individual worries","random sampling","related discrimination","perceptions of life","marketing of mental health education","confidence level","World Health Organization","nationwide representative sample of residents","maximum deviation of sampling error","pandemic","emerging infectious diseases","senior high school graduate","severe acute respiratory syndrome","telephone interview systems","Major predictors of higher levels of pessimism","preparedness","people","question","target population","computer","community populations","travel alert list","subject\u0027s changes","resolution","Purpose","participants","geographic area","study","months","Multivariate logistic regression","correlates of symptomatic cases","Methods","Background","Data","survey","Results","aim"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiological studies of these viruses in bats often utilize serology to describe viral dynamics, with particular attention paid to juveniles, whose birth increases the overall susceptibility of the population to a viral outbreak once maternal immunity wanes. However, little is understood about bat immunology, including the duration of maternal antibodies in neonates. Understanding duration of maternally derived immunity is critical for characterizing viral dynamics in bat populations, which may help assess the risk of spillover to humans. We conducted two separate studies of pregnant Pteropus bat species and their offspring to measure the half-life and duration of antibodies to 1) canine distemper virus antigen in vaccinated captive Pteropus hypomelanus; and 2) Hendra virus in wild-caught, naturally infected Pteropus alecto. Both of these pteropid bat species are known reservoirs for henipaviruses. We found that in both species, antibodies were transferred from dam to pup. In P. hypomelanus pups, titers against CDV waned over a mean period of 228.6 days (95% CI: 185.4\u2013271.8) and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 96.0 days (CI 95%: 30.7\u2013299.7). In P. alecto pups, antibodies waned over 255.13 days (95% CI: 221.0\u2013289.3) and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 52.24 days (CI 95%: 33.76\u201380.83). Each species showed a duration of transferred maternal immunity of between 7.5 and 8.5 months, which was longer than has been previously estimated. These data will allow for more accurate interpretation of age-related Henipavirus serological data collected from wild pteropid bats.","publish_time":"2013-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Epstein, Jonathan H.; Baker, Michelle L.; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos; Middleton, Deborah; Barr, Jennifer A.; DuBovi, Edward; Boyd, Victoria; Pope, Brian; Todd, Shawn; Crameri, Gary; Walsh, Allyson; Pelican, Katey; Fielder, Mark D.; Davies, Angela J.; Wang, Lin-Fa; Daszak, Peter","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7b6ba6c543bcfd967c19fc3663abee090ed3a25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3695084.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23826322/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067584","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days","duration of antibodies","duration of maternal antibodies","Hendra virus","pteropid bat species","Ebola virus","Marburg virus","viral dynamics","separate studies of pregnant Pteropus bat species","mean terminal phase half-life","bat populations","bat immunology","wild pteropid bats","maternal immunity wanes","canine distemper virus antigen","viral outbreak","henipaviruses","hypomelanus pups","derived immunity","infected Pteropus alecto","mean period","alecto pups","vaccinated captive Pteropus hypomelanus","Old World frugivorous bats","Epidemiological studies","accurate interpretation of age-related Henipavirus serological data","emerging zoonotic viruses of significant public health concern","natural hosts","Nipah","offspring","CDV","particular attention","birth","juveniles","overall susceptibility","titers","serology","reservoirs","neonates","risk of spillover","humans","dam","months"],"language":"en"},

Four antigenic sites have been defined (A, B, C, and D). The sites involved in the neutralization of TGEV are: A, D, and B, sites A and D being antigenically dominant for TGEV neutralization in vitro. These two sites have specific properties of interest: site A is highly conserved and is present in coronaviruses of three animal species, and site D can be represented by synthetic peptides. Both sites might be relevant in protection in vivo. PRCV does not have sites B and C, due to a genomic deletion. Complex antigenic sites, i.e., conformation and glycosylation dependent sites, have been represented by simple mimotopes selected from a library expressing recombinant peptides with random sequences, or by anti-idiotypic internal image monoclonal antibodies. An epidemiological tree relating the TGEVs and PRCVs has been proposed. The estimated mutation fixation rate of 7 \u00B1 2 \u00D7 10\u22124 substitutions per nucleotide and year indicates that TGEV related coronaviruses show similar variability to other RNA viruses. In order to induce secretory immunity, different segments of the S gene have been expressed using avirulent forms of Salmonella typhimurium and adenovirus.

Objective We sought to examine the relation of the nasal microbiota at bronchiolitis-related hospitalization and 3 later points to the risk of recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. Methods In 17 US centers researchers collected clinical data and nasal swabs from infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Trained parents collected nasal swabs 3 weeks after hospitalization and, when healthy, during the summer and 1 year after hospitalization. We applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to all nasal swabs. We used joint modeling to examine the relation of longitudinal nasal microbiota abundances to the risk of recurrent wheezing. Results Among 842 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, there was 88% follow-up at 3 years, and 31% had recurrent wheezing. The median age at enrollment was 3.2 months (interquartile range, 1.7-5.8 months). In joint modeling analyses adjusting for 16 covariates, including viral cause, a 10% increase in relative abundance of Moraxella or Streptococcus species 3 weeks after day 1 of hospitalization was associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing (hazard ratio [HR] of 1.38 and 95% high-density interval [HDI] of 1.11-1.85 and HR of 1.76 and 95% HDI of 1.13-3.19, respectively). Increased Streptococcus species abundance the summer after hospitalization was also associated with a greater risk of recurrent wheezing (HR, 1.76; 95% HDI, 1.15-3.27). Conclusions Enrichment of Moraxella or Streptococcus species after bronchiolitis hospitalization was associated with recurrent wheezing by age 3 years, possibly providing new avenues to ameliorate the long-term respiratory outcomes of infants with severe bronchiolitis.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mansbach, Jonathan M.; Luna, Pamela N.; Shaw, Chad A.; Hasegawa, Kohei; Petrosino, Joseph F.; Piedra, Pedro A.; Sullivan, Ashley F.; Espinola, Janice A.; Stewart, Christopher J.; Camargo, Carlos A.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3bcd82d8c1991aa3b1448ed237df0c427d672685.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7010548.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674919315167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31738994/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674919315167; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2019.10.034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HDI"],"locations":["Streptococcus"],"keyphrases":["bronchiolitis hospitalization","increased risk of recurrent wheezing","development of recurrent wheezing","greater risk of recurrent wheezing","bronchiolitis-related hospitalization","nasal swabs","severe bronchiolitis","HR","years","HDI","Increased Streptococcus species abundance","relation of longitudinal nasal microbiota abundances","weeks","summer","high-risk group of infants","months","median age","long-term respiratory outcomes of infants","relative abundance of Moraxella","joint modeling analyses","Conclusions Enrichment of Moraxella","clinical data","US centers researchers","later points","hazard ratio","covariates","new avenues","enrollment","S rRNA gene sequencing","airway microbiome","interquartile range","Trained parents","asthma","day","viral cause","Methods","role","high-density interval","follow-up","Results","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Deciding on the number, geographic location and hospitals to be selected as sentinel sites was a challenge. Based on the recently published WHO guideline for influenza surveillance (2012), this study presents the process for hospital sentinel site selection. METHODS: From the 2,165 hospitals in Indonesia, the first step was to shortlist to hospitals that had previously participated in respiratory disease surveillance systems and had acceptable surveillance performance history. The second step involved categorizing the shortlist according to five regions in Indonesia to maximize geographic representativeness. A checklist was developed based on the WHO recommended attributes for sentinel site selection including stability, feasibility, representativeness and the availability of data to enable disease burden estimation. Eight hospitals, a maximum of two per geographic region, were visited for checklist administration. Checklist findings from the eight hospitals were analyzed and sentinel sites selected in the third step. RESULTS: Six hospitals could be selected based on resources available to ensure system stability over a three-year period. For feasibility, all eight hospitals visited had mechanisms for specimen shipment and the capacity to report surveillance data, but two had limited motivation for system participation. For representativeness, the eight hospitals were geographically dispersed around Indonesia, and all could capture cases in all age and socio-economic groups. All eight hospitals had prerequisite population data to enable disease burden estimation. The two hospitals with low motivation were excluded and the remaining six were selected as sentinel sites. CONCLUSIONS: The multi-step process enabled sentinel site selection based on the WHO recommended attributes that emphasize right-sizing the surveillance system to ensure its stability and maximizing its geographic representativeness. This experience may guide other countries interested in adopting WHO\u2019s influenza surveillance standards for sentinel site selection.","publish_time":"2014-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Susilarini, Ni Ketut; Sitorus, Martahan; Praptaningsih, Catharina Yekti; Sampurno, Ondri Dwi; Bratasena, Arie; Mulyadi, Ester; Rusli, Roselinda; Fandil, Ahmad; Mangiri, Amalya; Apsari, Hana; Hariyanto, Edy; Samaan, Gina","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f25223579f443edc058800f30c4fe8847a6ab57.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4179842.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-14-424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25248619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["hospitals","sentinel sites","surveillance data","sentinel hospital","hospital sentinel site selection","geographic representativeness","Indonesia","system stability","influenza surveillance standards","respiratory disease surveillance systems","acceptable surveillance performance history","system participation","geographic region","geographic location","disease burden estimation","multi-step process","availability of data","feasibility","attributes","checklist administration","Checklist findings","shortlist","prerequisite population data","limited motivation","low motivation","severe acute respiratory infection","SARI","capacity","specimen shipment","cases","mechanisms","regions","study","resources available","age","socio-economic groups","CONCLUSIONS","countries","three-year period","guideline","number","maximum","BACKGROUND","challenge","experience","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to determine whether cytokines that can be expressed by mucosal cells have an effect on the rotavirus susceptibility of cultured human enterocytes. METHODS: Caco-2 and HT-29 cells were pretreated with various cytokines before challenge with rotavirus. RESULTS: Interleukin (IL)-1, interferon (IFN)-alpha, and IFN-gamma pretreatment led to a dose-dependent resistance to rotavirus infection. Maximum effects occurred after 72 hours of pretreatment, whereas no detectable inhibition occurred with \u003C12 hours of pretreatment. Liposomal transfection of single-shelled and double-shelled rotavirus particles bypassed the block to rotavirus replication in IFN-gamma- and IL-1- treated but not IFN-alpha-treated cells. Binding studies with purified, metabolically labeled rotavirus showed no significant difference among IFN-gamma- and IFN-alpha-treated and control Caco-2 cells. Viral entry into Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited by IFN-gamma and IL-1 but not IFN-alpha. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma induce rotavirus resistance by different mechanisms, suggesting that cytokines play a role in host defense against viral agents by changing the phenotype of intestinal epithelial cells.

Transition metals from Mn(II) to Zn(II) function as metalloenzyme cofactors in all living cells, and the successful pathogen is capable of mounting an adaptive response to mitigate the effects of host control of transition metal bioavailability. Emerging evidence suggests that Mn, Fe, and Zn are withheld from the pathogen in classically defined nutritional immunity, while Cu is used to kill invading microorganisms. This Account summarizes new molecular-level insights into copper trafficking across cell membranes from studies of a number of important bacterial pathogens and model organisms, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, to illustrate general principles of cellular copper resistance. Recent highlights of copper chemistry at the host\u2013microbial pathogen interface include the first high resolution structures and functional characterization of a Cu(I)-effluxing P(1B)-ATPase, a new class of bacterial copper chaperone, a fungal Cu-only superoxide dismutase SOD5, and the discovery of a small molecule Cu-bound SOD mimetic. Successful harnessing by the pathogen of host-derived bactericidal Cu to reduce the bacterial load of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an emerging theme; in addition, recent studies continue to emphasize the importance of short lifetime protein\u2013protein interactions that orchestrate the channeling of Cu(I) from donor to target without dissociation into bulk solution; this, in turn, mitigates the off-pathway effects of Cu(I) toxicity in both the periplasm in Gram negative organisms and in the bacterial cytoplasm. It is unclear as yet, outside of the photosynthetic bacteria, whether Cu(I) is trafficked to other cellular destinations, for example, to cuproenzymes or other intracellular storage sites, or the general degree to which copper chaperones vs copper efflux transporters are essential for bacterial pathogenesis in the vertebrate host. Future studies will be directed toward the identification and structural characterization of other cellular targets of Cu(I) trafficking and resistance, the physical and mechanistic characterization of Cu(I)-transfer intermediates, and elucidation of the mutual dependence of Cu(I) trafficking and cellular redox status on thiol chemistry in the cytoplasm. Crippling bacterial control of Cu(I) sensing, trafficking, and efflux may represent a viable strategy for the development of new antibiotics.","publish_time":"2014-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Yue; Chang, Feng-Ming James; Giedroc, David P.","journal":"Acc Chem Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a44db0cd6d4fc9de13845db4c130a7d82560f682.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4268108.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ar500300n; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial control of Cu","fungal Cu","channeling of Cu","cellular targets of Cu","mechanistic characterization of Cu","copper trafficking","pathway effects of Cu","derived bactericidal Cu","mutual dependence of Cu","pathogen of host","bacterial cytoplasm","bacterial pathogenesis","new class of bacterial copper chaperone","general principles of cellular copper resistance","successful pathogen","copper chaperones vs copper efflux transporters","small molecule Cu-bound SOD mimetic","Recent highlights of copper chemistry","number of important bacterial pathogens","vertebrate host","effects of host control of transition metal bioavailability","recent studies","cellular destinations","microbial pathogen interface","bacterial load of reactive oxygen species","microbial pathogens","functional characterization","cellular redox status","structural characterization","Transition metals","Future studies","Mn","Zn","nutritional immunity","development of new antibiotics","general degree","model organisms","Salmonella species","new molecular-level insights","protein interactions","thiol chemistry","emerging theme","Emerging evidence","Successful harnessing","invading microorganisms","row late d-block transition metal ions","Gram negative organisms","importance of short lifetime protein","Escherichia coli","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","cell membranes","high resolution structures","ROS","discovery","Streptococcus pneumoniae","living cells","text","human innate immune system","cuproenzymes","intracellular storage sites","elucidation","superoxide dismutase SOD5","ATPase","metalloenzyme cofactors","viable strategy","means","periplasm","Account","example","adaptive response","addition","toxicity","process","identification","sensing","bulk solution","effluxing P","transfer intermediates","dissociation","turn","donor","Image","photosynthetic bacteria"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of a multi-institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID-19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher\u0027s exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. RESULTS: Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p \u003C 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground-glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoon, Soon Ho; Lee, Kyung Hee; Kim, Jin Yong; Lee, Young Kyung; Ko, Hongseok; Kim, Ki Hwan; Park, Chang Min; Kim, Yun-Hyeon","journal":"Korean J Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/938eca42d73a6e5445fc7617b37e1aae84f712a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7082662.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32100485/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":["Society of Thoracic Radiology"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["patchy lesions","CT findings of COVID","shape of pulmonary lesions","large confluent lesions","small nodular lesions","pneumonia","Chest CT images","chest radiographic","chest radiography","CT scans","pure ground-glass opacities","mixed ground-glass opacities","nodular shape","normal chest radiographs","bilateral peripheral posterior lungs","considerable proportion of patients","peripheral consolidations","bilateral involvement","parenchymal abnormalities","posterior lung fields","computed tomography","preliminary report","Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology","unilobar reversed halo sign","novel coronavirus disease","multi-institutional collaboration","infections","study","Fisher\u0027s exact test","lower lobes","bronchovascular bundles","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","total","CONCLUSION","baseline","MATERIALS","pleura","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

While age-related changes in primary lymphoid organs (bone marrow, and, in particular, the thymus, which involutes in the first third of life) have been long appreciated, changes affecting aging secondary lymphoid organs, and, in particular, aging lymph nodes (LNs) have been less well characterized.

In the present study, we explored the interplay between PCV2 replication and the UPS in PK15 cells and found that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor (MG132 and lactacystin) significantly decreased the PCV2 titer at the early infection stage. We further revealed that inhibition of the UPS did not affect virus entry but decreased viral protein expression and RNA transcription potentially in a cell cycle-dependent manner. PCV2 infection has little effect on the chymotrypsin-like activity, and the gene-silencing of ubiquitin reduced the PCV2 titer, which indicates that the effective replication of PCV2 may be related to protein ubiquitination. Taken together, our data suggested that PCV2 replication requires the UPS machinery, which may represent a potential antiviral target against PCV2.","publish_time":"2014-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Shuang; Yan, Weidong; Gu, Wei; He, Qigai","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c28106424c8a2b999b5057881d31cdaa9c9433b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127601.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24889239/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221400110X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268221400110X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.03.028","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPS","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV2 replication","PCV2 infection","PCV2 titer","effective replication of PCV2","viral infection","UPS machinery","viral protein expression","early infection stage","ubiquitin-proteasome system","Abstract Porcine circovirus type","proteasome inhibitor","protein ubiquitination","primary causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated diseases","RNA transcription","treatment","virus entry","lactacystin","interplay","role","little effect","PK15 cells","cell cycle-dependent manner","activity","MG132","chymotrypsin","PCVAD","gene-silencing","potential antiviral target","present study","data","inhibition"],"language":"en"},

The two events were supposed to be correlated, also based on the limited information available about the new virus. Despite that clear indications about the role of particulate matter (PM) in the virus mechanism dispersion cannot be found in literature, some researchers supposed that PM can act as virus carrier, promoting its diffusion through the air. This paper, for the first time, analyses the PM10 situation in Lombardy (from 10th February to 27th March 2020), several days before the sanitary emergency explosion. The data of the detected infection cases are reported and discussed parallelly. As a comparison, the situation of Piedmont, located near to the Lombardy is also presented. Data are reported for Brescia, Bergamo, Cremona, Lodi, Milano, Monza-Brianza, Pavia (Lombardy), Alessandria, Vercelli, Novara, Biella, Asti, and Torino (Piedmont). The results show that it is not possible to conclude that COVID-19 diffusion mechanism also occurs through the air, by using PM10 as a carrier. In particular, it is shown that Piedmont cities, presenting lower detected infections cases in comparison to Brescia and Bergamo in the investigated period, had most sever PM10 pollution events in comparison to Lombardy cities. This first study may serve as a reference to better understand and predict the factors affecting the COVID-19 diffusion and transmission routes, focusing on the role of air particulate matter in the atmosphere.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bontempi, E.","journal":"Environ Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2aac17719e997a27ebf02a675e212a01728fe0fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7204748.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120305326; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109639; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305326?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brescia","Bergamo","Vercelli","Lombardy"],"keyphrases":["Lombardy cities","Brescia","comparison","PM10 situation","period of PM10 pollution","PM10 pollution events","Piedmont cities","diffusion mechanism","virus carrier","situation of Piedmont","severe cases of COVID","role of air particulate matter","lower detected infections cases","role of particulate matter","detected infection cases","Bergamo areas","new virus","virus mechanism dispersion","days","data","investigated period","Milano","Lodi","Monza-Brianza","Biella","Asti","Vercelli","Alessandria","Pavia","Cremona","\u03BCg","m3","Novara","attention limit","limited information available","literature","concentration","transmission routes","clear indications","sanitary emergency explosion","Torino","time","atmosphere","Italy","researchers","factors","study","reference","results","paper","beginning"],"language":"en"},

Sensitive molecular-based assays aid virus detection, but the clinical significance of positive tests remains uncertain as some viruses may be found in both acutely ill and healthy children. We describe disease-pathogen associations of respiratory viruses and quantify virus-specific attributable risk of ARIs in healthy children during the first 2 years of life. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight term newborn babies in Brisbane, Australia, were recruited progressively into a longitudinal, community-based, birth cohort study conducted between September 2010 and October 2014. A daily tick-box diary captured predefined respiratory symptoms from birth until their second birthday. Weekly parent-collected nasal swabs were batch-tested for 17 respiratory viruses by PCR assays, allowing calculation of virus-specific attributable fractions in the exposed (AFE) to determine the proportion of virus-positive children whose ARI symptoms could be attributed to that particular virus. RESULTS: Of 8100 nasal swabs analysed, 2646 (32.7%) were virus-positive (275 virus codetections, 3.4%), with human rhinoviruses accounting for 2058/2646 (77.8%) positive swabs. Viruses were detected in 1154/1530 (75.4%) ARI episodes and in 984/4308 (22.8%) swabs from asymptomatic periods. Respiratory syncytial virus (AFE: 68% (95% CI 45% to 82%)) and human metapneumovirus (AFE: 69% (95% CI 43% to 83%)) were strongly associated with higher risk of lower respiratory symptoms. DISCUSSION: The strong association of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus with ARIs and lower respiratory symptoms in young children managed within the community indicates successful development of vaccines against these two viruses should provide substantial health benefits.","publish_time":"2017-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarna, Mohinder; Lambert, Stephen B; Sloots, Theo P; Whiley, David M; Alsaleh, Asma; Mhango, Lebogang; Bialasiewicz, Seweryn; Wang, David; Nissen, Michael D; Grimwood, Keith; Ware, Robert S","journal":"Thorax","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/829ce386c84e17559ca6a06ee9aee0475e473343.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7b9f9339ac1f541b560e1c3c0ce6697cb8c8cc3b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6166599.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29247051/; https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2017-210233","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["virus-positive","calculation of virus","proportion of virus","virus codetections","particular virus","predefined respiratory symptoms","strong association of respiratory syncytial virus","positive children","positive swabs","virus-specific attributable risk of ARIs","higher risk of lower respiratory symptoms","disease-pathogen associations of respiratory viruses","healthy children","ARI symptoms","AFE","nasal swabs","Viral acute respiratory infections","young children","human metapneumovirus","Sensitive molecular-based assays aid virus detection","community","clinical significance of positive tests","specific attributable fractions","human rhinoviruses accounting","PCR assays","ARI episodes","birth cohort study","substantial health benefits","cause substantial child morbidity","daily tick-box diary","term newborn babies","batch","Brisbane","Australia","INTRODUCTION","successful development of vaccines","Weekly parent","DISCUSSION","METHODS","years of life","asymptomatic periods","RESULTS","birthday"],"language":"en"},

Inoculation of IDV to na\u00EFve calves resulted in mild respiratory disease histologically characterized by tracheitis. As several studies have associated the presence of IDV with acute bovine respiratory disease (BRD), we sought to investigate the efficacy of an inactivated IDV vaccine. Vaccinated calves seroconverted with hemagglutination inhibition titers 137\u2013169 following two doses. Non-vaccinated calves challenged with a homologous virus exhibited signs of mild respiratory disease from days four to ten post challenge which was significantly different than negative controls at days five and nine post challenge. Peak viral shedding of approximately 5 TCID50/mL was measured in nasal and tracheal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids four to six days post challenge. Viral titers were significantly (P \u003C0.05) decreased 1.4 TCID50/mL, 3.6 TCID50/mL and 5.0 TCID50/mL, respectively, in the aforementioned samples collected from vaccinated animals compared to non-vaccinated controls at peak shedding. Viral antigen was detected in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinates and trachea by immunohistochemistry from all unvaccinated calves but in significantly fewer vaccinates. Inflammation characterized by neutrophils was observed in the nasal turbinate and trachea but not appreciably in lungs. Together these results support an etiologic role for IDV in BRD and demonstrate that partial protection is afforded by an inactivated vaccine.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hause, Ben M.; Huntimer, Lucas; Falkenberg, Shollie; Henningson, Jamie; Lechtenberg, Kelly; Halbur, Tom","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/279ba3b464e77475ae1a72222912002711eefbea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117347.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516308239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28110784/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516308239; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.12.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TCID50","Non-vaccinated calves","days post challenge","non-vaccinated controls","inactivated IDV vaccine","signs of mild respiratory disease","respiratory epithelium","vaccinated animals","na\u00EFve calves","presence of IDV","unvaccinated calves","Inoculation of IDV","Viral titers","Peak viral shedding","acute bovine respiratory disease","nasal turbinates","BRD","peak shedding","inactivated vaccine","Viral antigen","homologous virus","negative controls","hemagglutination inhibition titers","proposed influenza D virus","bronchoalveolar lavage fluids","swine","tracheal swabs","immunohistochemistry","etiologic role","partial protection","neutrophils","results","aforementioned samples","efficacy","tracheitis","fewer","studies","cattle","Inflammation","doses","lungs"],"language":"en"},

A defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) in MERS-CoV spike protein can potentially serve as a subunit vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV infections. To identify an ideal vaccine candidate, we have constructed five different versions of RBD fragments, S350-588-Fc, S358-588-Fc, S367-588-Fc, S367-606-Fc, and S377-588-Fc (their names indicate their residue range in the spike protein and their C-terminal Fc tag), and further investigated their receptor binding affinity, antigenicity, immunogenicity, and neutralizing potential. The results showed that S377-588-Fc is among the RBD fragments that demonstrated the highest DPP4-binding affinity and induced the highest-titer IgG antibodies in mice. In addition, S377-588-Fc elicited higher-titer neutralizing antibodies than all the other RBD fragments in mice, and also induced high-titer neutralizing antibodies in immunized rabbits. Structural analysis suggests that S377-588-Fc contains the stably folded RBD structure, the full receptor-binding site, and major neutralizing epitopes, such that additional structures to this fragment introduce non-neutralizing epitopes and may also alter the tertiary structure of the RBD. Taken together, our data suggest that the RBD fragment encompassing spike residues 377-588 is a critical neutralizing receptor-binding fragment and an ideal candidate for development of effective MERS vaccines, and that adding non-neutralizing structures to this RBD fragment diminishes its neutralizing potential. Therefore, in viral vaccine design, it is important to identify the most stable and neutralizing viral RBD fragment, while eliminating unnecessary and non-neutralizing structures, as a means of \u201Cimmunofocusing\u201D.","publish_time":"2014-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Cuiqing; Wang, Lili; Tao, Xinrong; Zhang, Naru; Yang, Yang; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Li, Fang; Zhou, Yusen; Jiang, Shibo; Du, Lanying","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e582bc041b65f0b488e292996f0c07d6dae95143.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8372200a0a5a24d19771c584a403e2b4281eddfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4194190.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X14012559; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.08.086; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14012559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25240756/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["neutralizing potential","viral RBD fragment","non-neutralizing structures","critical neutralizing receptor-binding fragment","non-neutralizing epitopes","major neutralizing epitopes","folded RBD structure","S377","receptor binding affinity","different versions of RBD fragments","receptor-binding site","MERS-CoV spike protein","MERS-CoV infections","C-terminal Fc tag","development of effective MERS vaccines","defined receptor-binding domain","ideal vaccine candidate","highest DPP4-binding affinity","ideal candidate","high-titer","subunit vaccine candidate","highest-titer IgG antibodies","additional structures","higher-titer","spike residues","mice","viral vaccine design","S367","high priority","tertiary structure","emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","S350","antigenicity","immunogenicity","residue range","humans","means","S358","immunized rabbits","names","Structural analysis","data","immunofocusing","results"],"language":"en"},

Hybridization-based target enrichment is one potential method for increasing the sensitivity of viral detection via high-throughput sequencing. RESULTS: This study expands upon two previously developed panels of virus enrichment probes (for filoviruses and for respiratory viruses) to include other viruses of biodefense and/or biosurveillance concern to the U.S. Department of Defense and various international public health agencies. The newly expanded and combined panel is tested using carefully constructed synthetic metagenomic samples that contain clinically relevant amounts of viral genetic material. Target enrichment results in a dramatic increase in sensitivity for virus detection as compared to shotgun sequencing, yielding full, deeply covered viral genomes from materials with Ct values suggesting that amplicon sequencing would be likely to fail. Increased pooling to improve cost- and time-effectiveness does not negatively affect the ability to obtain full-length viral genomes, even in the case of co-infections, although as expected, it does decrease depth of coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Hybridization-based target enrichment is an effective solution to obtain full-length viral genomes for samples from which virus detection would fail via unbiased, shotgun sequencing or even via amplicon sequencing. As the development and testing of probe sets for viral target enrichment expands and continues, the application of this technique, in conjunction with deeper pooling strategies, could make high-throughput sequencing more economical for routine use in biosurveillance, biodefense and outbreak investigations.

An outbreak of acute febrile syndrome affecting 22 refugees resident at the Asylum Seekers Centre of Castelnuovo di Porto in Rome has been reported, and the preventive and control measures adopted have been described as an example of public health safety. Methods Pharyngeal swab and whole-blood samples were collected from 22 cases observed and analyzed for standard bacterial cultures and respiratory and herpesviruses by qualitative CLART PneumoVir2 and Entherpex microarray. Results A possible respiratory-transmitted etiology and a concomitant reactivation of multiple herpesviruses have been evidenced. The epidemiological investigation showed that the spread of the epidemic was promoted because patients were hosted in neighboring rooms or in the same room, facilitating the rapid spread of infectious disease. Conclusions The potential way of transmission was supposed, and preventive measures for infection control were adopted. The measures adopted are an example of best practice for outbreak management, and the microbiological surveillance is recommended for public health improvement.","publish_time":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ciccozzi, M.; Riva, E.; Vita, S.; Cella, E.; Fogolari, M.; Spoto, S.; Lopalco, M.; Ceccarelli, G.; Angeletti, S.","journal":"Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26a32c5f0bf12828c52ebdd73260941c709c73f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111893.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031836/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2018.05.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350618301963; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350618301963","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Entherpex"],"locations":["Rome"],"keyphrases":["preventive measures","control measures","public health improvement","example of public health safety","outbreak management","important public health issue","management of infectious outbreaks","rapid spread of infectious disease","infection control","example of best practice","concomitant reactivation of multiple herpesviruses","possible respiratory-transmitted etiology","outbreak of acute febrile syndrome","closed settings","refugees resident","qualitative CLART PneumoVir2","Asylum Seekers Centre of Castelnuovo","microbiological surveillance","Porto","standard bacterial cultures","blood samples","Entherpex microarray","cases","Abstract Objectives","Methods Pharyngeal swab","potential way of transmission","patients","neighboring rooms","Conclusions","epidemiological investigation","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Large entities that support chiropractic education or practice were invited to participate in this report. Leaders of various entities were emailed an invitation. A designee who was assigned by the leader provided a brief synopsis of actions the entity had taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only entities that responded are included in this report. RESULTS: Five entities agreed to participate: The Council on Chiropractic Education, Association of Chiropractic Colleges, Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards, National Board of Chiropractic Examiners, and the NCMIC. Common themes included (1) recognizing the crisis and taking action; (2) establishing a safe working environment for staff so that services could continue; (3) delivering communications to stakeholders (chiropractic students, practitioners, licensing boards, and others) to guide decisions and direct actions; and (4) continuing to monitor the situation and respond as new information becomes available. CONCLUSION: These entities serve a large portion of the chiropractic profession. They have been quick to respond in a responsible, compassionate, and supportive manner to assist chiropractic licensing boards, practitioners, and students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are encouraging as the chiropractic profession looks to the future as it navigates changes in education and the healthcare environment in the months and years ahead.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Claire D.; Little, Craig S.; Sterling, Tamara A.; Gojkovich, Scott; Boghosian, Karlos; Ciolfi, Michael A.","journal":"J Manipulative Physiol Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa9b69d7695148c8fb0a3f4ced93467f090f34d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167579.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmpt.2020.04.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161475420301202; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161475420301202?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32386752/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Council on Chiropractic Education"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chiropractic entities","chiropractic education","chiropractic students","chiropractic profession","Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards","Association of Chiropractic Colleges","Large entities","National Board of Chiropractic Examiners","COVID","pandemic","report","Leaders of various entities","practitioners","direct actions","brief synopsis of actions","healthcare environment","large portion","safe working environment","supportive manner","early stages","staff","entity","coronavirus disease","changes","response","stakeholders","future","Council","new information","services","months","years","communications","METHODS","practice","situation","OBJECTIVE","purpose","decisions","invitation","NCMIC","CONCLUSION","findings","Common themes","crisis","designee","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

HRV viral load assays are available but limitations that affect accurate quantification exist. We developed a one-step Taqman assay using oligonucleotides designed based on a comprehensive list of global HRV sequences. The new oligonucleotides targeting the 5\u2032-UTR region showed high PCR efficiency (E = 99.6%, R(2) = 0.996), with quantifiable viral load as low as 2 viral copies/\u03BCl. Assay evaluation using an External Quality Assessment (EQA) panel yielded a detection rate of 90%. When tested on 315 human enterovirus-positive specimens comprising at least 84 genetically distinct HRV types/serotypes (determined by the VP4/VP2 gene phylogenetic analysis), the assay detected all HRV species and types, as well as other non-polio enteroviruses. A commercial quantification kit, which failed to detect any of the EQA specimens, produced a detection rate of 13.3% (42/315) among the clinical specimens. Using the improved assay, we showed that HRV sheds in the upper respiratory tract for more than a week following acute infection. We also showed that HRV-C had a significantly higher viral load at 2\u20137 days after the onset of symptoms (p = 0.001). The availability of such assay is important to facilitate disease management, antiviral development, and infection control.","publish_time":"2016-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Kim Tien; Chook, Jack Bee; Oong, Xiang Yong; Chan, Yoke Fun; Chan, Kok Gan; Hanafi, Nik Sherina; Pang, Yong Kek; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba; Tee, Kok Keng","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39256700827927ad3a10a34067c8cae742445274.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5056400.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep34855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27721388/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV","External Quality Assessment"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV sheds","HRV-C","HRV species","HRV viral load assays","distinct HRV types","Assay evaluation","improved assay","higher viral load","quantifiable viral load","viral copies","EQA specimens","one-step Taqman assay","comprehensive list of global HRV sequences","detection rate","clinical specimens","human enterovirus-positive specimens","upper respiratory tract","infection control","acute infection","accurate quantification","new oligonucleotides","Human rhinovirus","major aetiology of respiratory tract infections","commercial quantification kit","panel","External Quality Assessment","limitations","antiviral development","disease management","high PCR efficiency","VP4","UTR region","VP2 gene phylogenetic analysis","week","days","serotypes","onset of symptoms","\u03BCl","non-polio enteroviruses","availability"],"language":"en"},

Hence, we evaluated the survival of PEDV on inanimate objects routinely used on swine farms such as styrofoam, rubber, plastic, coveralls, and other equipment. The titer of infectious PEDV at 4 \u00B0C decreased by only 1 to 2 log during the first 5 days, and the virus was recoverable for up to 15 days on Styrofoam, aluminum, Tyvek(\u00AE) coverall, cloth, and plastic. However, viral titers decreased precipitously when stored at room temperature; no virus was detectable after one day on all materials tested. A more sensitive immunoplaque assay was able to detect virus from Styrofoam, metal, and plastic at 20 days post application, representing a 3-log loss of input virus on fomite materials. Recovery of infectious PEDV from Tyvek(\u00AE) coverall and rubber was above detection limit at 20 days.

An RNA probe containing this 11-nucleotide sequence bound four cellular proteins with a highly labeled protein of 120 kDa and three minor species with sizes of 103, 81, and 55 kDa. Mutation of the 11-nucleotide motif abolished cellular protein binding. The RNA\u2013protein complexes observed with cytoplasmic extracts from MHV-JHM-infected cells in both RNase protection/gel mobility shift and UV cross-linking assays were indistinguishable from those observed with extracts from uninfected cells. Both negative-strand synthesis and positive-strand replication of viral defective interfering RNAs in the presence of helper virus were affected by mutations that disrupt RNA\u2013protein complex formation, even though the 11 mutated nucleotides were converted to the wild-type sequence, presumably by recombination with helper virus. Kinetic analysis indicated that recombination between DI RNA and helper virus occurred relatively early in the MHV replicative cycle at 5.5 to 7.5 hr postinfection, a time when viral RNA synthesis and replication of positive-strand DI RNA were at barely detectable levels. A DI RNA with a mutation upstream of the protein binding element replicated as efficiently as wild type without undergoing recombination. Thus, the 11-nucleotide conserved host protein binding motif appears to play an important role in viral RNA replication.","publish_time":"1995-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"YU, WEI; LEIBOWITZ, JULIAN L.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df2139e29e0ed3891126f4d3ba2262eb22244191.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682285799473; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682285799473","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DI RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral RNA replication","viral RNA synthesis","RNA probe","strand DI RNA","cellular protein binding","protein binding element","protein complexes","labeled protein","nucleotide conserved host protein binding motif","nucleotide sequence","nucleotide motif","genomic RNA of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus","protein complex formation","recombination","presence of helper virus","replication of positive","negative-strand synthesis","wild-type sequence","positive-strand replication of viral defective interfering RNAs","wild type","kDa","MHV-JHM","cytoplasmic extracts","cellular proteins","uninfected cells","MHV replicative cycle","gel mobility shift","RNase protection","UV cross-linking assays","time","important role","hr postinfection","mutations","sizes","end","UGAAUGAAGUU","minor species","Kinetic analysis","detectable levels","mutated nucleotides"],"language":"en"},

Besides their many advantages, smartphones might pave the way to compulsive usage and addictive experiences. To remedy this problem, this study proposes an authentic approach which integrates consumer behavior theories and techniques such as unhook and gamification. An education program has been designed based on these approaches to decrease the problematic smartphone use. Method: The participants of the education program consisted of 305 students (48.2% girls and 51.8% boys) with a mean age of 14.57 (SD = 0.74). The Demographic Form and Smartphone Addiction Scale for Adolescents (SASA) were conducted before the education program and three weeks after the education. Results: The results of the paired sample t-test analysis before and after the education program revealed that the SASA total scores decreased significantly (p \u003C 0.01). There are significant differences in terms of gender, mothers\u2019 education and class levels. Conclusion: This research emphasizes the role of an interdisciplinary approach to the addiction problem.

Despite the clinical importance of feline retroviruses and the growing interest in cats as pets, information about FeLV and FIV in Malaysia is presently insufficient to properly advise veterinarians and pet owners. A cross-sectional study was carried out from January 2010 to December 2010 to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with FeLV and FIV among domestic cats in peninsular Malaysia. Plasma samples were harvested from the blood of 368 domestic cats and screened for evidence of FeLV p27 antigen and FIV antibodies, using an immunochromatographic kit. Additionally, data on cat demographics and health were collected using a structured questionnaire, and were evaluated as potential risk factors for FeLV or FIV status. RESULTS: Of the 368 cats that were evaluated in this study, 12.2% (45/368; 95% CI = 8.88 - 15.58) were positive for FeLV p27 antigen, 31.3%, (115/368; 95% CI = 26.51 - 35.99) were seropositive to FIV antibodies, and 4.3% (16/368; 95% CI = 2.27 - 6.43) had evidence of both viruses. Factors found to significantly increase the risk for FeLV seropositivity include sex, age, behaviour, sickness, and living in a multi-cat household. Seropositive response to FIV was significantly associated with sex, neuter status, age, behaviour, and health status. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that FeLV and FIV are common among domestic cats in peninsular Malaysia, and that factors related to cat demographics and health such as age, sex, behaviour, health status and type of household are important predictors for seropositive status to FeLV or FIV in peninsular Malaysia. High prevalence of FeLV or FIV observed in our study is of concern, in view of the immunosuppressive potentials of the two pathogens. Specific measures for control and prevention such as screening and routine vaccination are needed to ensure that FeLV and FIV are controlled in the cat population of peninsular Malaysia.","publish_time":"2012-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bande, Faruku; Arshad, Siti Suri; Hassan, Latiffah; Zakaria, Zunita; Sapian, Nurul Asyikin; Rahman, Noor Alimah; Alazawy, Amer","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f06dde80e1f11939bb7306853ca92a8c9382ede4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3349470.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-33; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22439903/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIV"],"locations":["Malaysia"],"keyphrases":["FIV status","FIV antibodies","FeLV seropositivity","High prevalence of FeLV","health status","domestic cats","evidence of FeLV p27 antigen","seropositive status","cat population of peninsular Malaysia","age","sex","behaviour","neuter status","cat demographics","potential risk factors","present study","cross-sectional study","multi-cat household","feline immunodeficiency virus","Feline leukaemia virus","Seropositive response","type of household","clinical importance of feline retroviruses","important predictors","prevention","mortality","major causes of morbidity","pets","information","control","screening","view","blood","sickness","BACKGROUND","immunosuppressive potentials","routine vaccination","wild felids","veterinarians","Specific measures","concern","immunochromatographic kit","data","pet owners","structured questionnaire","pathogens","Plasma samples","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Despite decades of research, a complete integrated picture of RSV-host interaction is still missing. Several cellular responses to stress are involved in the host-response to many virus infections. The endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function leads to activation of the unfolded-protein response (UPR) to restore homeostasis. Formation of cytoplasmic stress granules containing translationally stalled mRNAs is a means to control protein translation. Production of reactive oxygen species is balanced by an antioxidant response to prevent oxidative stress and the resulting damages. In recent years, ongoing research has started to unveil specific regulatory interactions of RSV with these host cellular stress responses. Here, we discuss the latest findings regarding the mechanisms evolved by RSV to induce, subvert or manipulate the ER stress, the stress granule and oxidative stress responses. We summarize the evidence linking these stress responses with the regulation of RSV replication and the associated pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2016-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cervantes-Ortiz, Sandra L.; Zamorano Cuervo, Natalia; Grandvaux, Nathalie","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6df7585dc7616c55baf0dd0df0a8a283f8805acd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4885079.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v8050124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27187445/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ER stress","oxidative stress responses","host cellular stress responses","endoplasmic reticulum stress","host-response","Formation of cytoplasmic stress granules","cellular responses","regulation of RSV replication","complete integrated picture of RSV","specific regulatory interactions of RSV","host interaction","antioxidant response","unfolded-protein response","Human respiratory syncytial virus","ongoing research","decades of research","virus infections","protein translation","major cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract infection","infants","stalled mRNAs","function","activation","Paramyxoviridae family","means","UPR","member","Production of reactive oxygen species","immunocompromised adults","associated pathogenesis","recent years","mechanisms","resulting damages","latest findings","homeostasis","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Objective To study whether RSV or RV types are differentially associated with the future use of asthma control medication. Methods Over 2 consecutive winter seasons (2008-2010), we enrolled 408 children hospitalized for bronchiolitis at age less than 24 months into a prospective, 3-center, 4-year follow-up study in Finland. Virus detection was performed by real-time reverse transcription PCR from nasal wash samples. Four years later, we examined current use of asthma control medication. Results A total of 349 (86%) children completed the 4-year follow-up. At study entry, the median age was 7.5 months, and 42% had RSV, 29% RV, 2% both RSV and RV, and 27% non-RSV/-RV etiology. The children with RV-A (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.3; P = .01), RV-C (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.5; P \u003C .001), and non-RSV/-RV (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.0; P = .004) bronchiolitis started the asthma control medication earlier than did children with RSV bronchiolitis.

The highest risk was found among patients with RV-C, atopic dermatitis, and fever (adjusted odds ratio, 5.0; P = .03). Conclusions Severe bronchiolitis caused by RV-A and RV-C was associated with earlier initiation and prolonged use of asthma control medication.

Modelling is possible because epidemics involve relatively simple processes occurring within large populations of individuals. Modelling aims to explain and predict trends in disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity or mortality. Models give important insight into the development of epidemics. Following disease establishment, epidemic growth is approximately exponential. The rate of growth in this phase is primarily determined by the basic reproduction number (R0), the number of secondary cases per primary case when the population is susceptible. R0 also determines the ease with which control policies can control epidemics. Once a significant proportion of the population has been infected, not all contacts of an infected individual will be with susceptible people. Infection can now continue only because new births replenish the susceptible population. Eventually, an endemic equilibrium is reached whereby every infected person infects one other individual on average. Heterogeneity in host susceptibility, infectiousness, human contact patterns and the genetic composition of pathogen populations introduces substantial additional complexity into the models required to model real diseases realistically. The contribution concludes with a brief review of the recent application of mathematical models to emerging human and animal epidemics, notably the spread of HIV in Africa, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease epidemic in the UK and its relationship to bovine spongiform encephalitis in cattle, the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in UK livestock, bioterrorism threats such as smallpox, and the SARS epidemics in 2003.","publish_time":"2005-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferguson, Neil M","journal":"Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02c0ea4d7baa5d4a1be0ef51ec6f0f59ade2d1f9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303906001769; https://doi.org/10.1383/medc.33.3.1.61124; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357303906001769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","SARS"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["infectious disease epidemics","animal epidemics","development of epidemics","SARS epidemics","susceptible population","epidemic growth","disease incidence","disease establishment","infected individual","variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease epidemic","mouth epidemic","recent application of mathematical models","R0","infected person","susceptible people","Modelling","UK livestock","rate of growth","human contact patterns","number of secondary cases","large populations of individuals","basic reproduction number","genetic composition of pathogen populations","cattle","infectiousness","relationship","foot","substantial additional complexity","Africa","primary case","host susceptibility","bioterrorism threats","simple processes","bovine spongiform encephalitis","prevalence","smallpox","brief review","spread of HIV","morbidity","trends","important insight","new births","mortality","Heterogeneity","phase","endemic equilibrium","contribution","average","significant proportion","real diseases","policies","contacts","Infection"],"language":"en"},

Heifers (n=33) were assigned randomly after parturition to lactating (L, n=17) or nonlactating (NL, n=16) groups. Cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization program for a timed artificial insemination (TAI); 10 cows in L and 12 in NL were inseminated. Slaughter occurred 17 d after the day equivalent to TAI, and intercaruncular endometrial tissues were collected. Gene expression was determined by DNA microarray analysis for pregnant (L, n=8; NL, n=6) and noninseminated cyclic (L, n=7; NL, n=4) cows. Differentially expressed genes were selected with a P-value \u003C0.01 and absolute expression \u003E40. In addition, a fold effect \u003E1.5 was used as a criterion for genes affected by pregnancy. In total, 210 genes were differentially regulated by lactation (136 downregulated and 74 upregulated), and 702 genes were differentially regulated by pregnancy (407 downregulated and 295 upregulated). The interaction effect of pregnancy and lactation affected 61 genes. Genes up- and downregulated in pregnant cows were associated with several gene ontology terms, such as defense response and interferon regulatory factor, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix. The gene ontology analyses of up- and downregulated genes of lactating cows revealed terms related to immunoglobulin-like fold, immune response, COMM domain, and non-membrane-bounded organelle. Several genes upregulated by lactation, such as IGHG1, IGLL1, IGK, and TRD, were related to immune function, particularly for B cells and \u03B3\u03B4 T cells. Developmental genes related to limb and neural development and glucose homeostasis (e.g., DKK1, RELN, PDK4) were downregulated by lactation, whereas an interaction was also detected for RELN.

Its usefulness for determining cell counts in canine and feline intracavitary effusions has not yet been studied. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the analytical performance of the Sysmex XT\u20102000iV for cell counts in effusions from dogs and cats, and to assess correlation with an impedance counter and concordance with diagnoses based on cytologic findings. Methods: Effusions (43 pleural, 23 peritoneal, 6 pericardial) were analyzed from 32 dogs and 34 cats. Total nucleated cell count (TNCC), HCT, and RBC count were determined on the Sysmex and compared with those obtained on an impedance counter (Hemat 8, SEAC). Imprecision, linearity, and limit of detection were determined for the Sysmex. An algorithm was designed using quantitative and qualitative data from the Sysmex to classify the effusions and the results were compared with diagnoses based on cytologic findings. Results: Intra\u2010assay and interassay coefficients of variation on the Sysmex were variable. Linearity of TNCC was \u22650.993 for dogs and cats, with the exception of effusions from cats with feline infectious peritonitis, which had delta (\u0394) TNC values \u003E3.0. In comparison with the Hemat 8, a proportional error was found for TNCC on the Sysmex. Effusion classification based on the algorithm was concordant with that obtained by cytologic examination in 43/72 (60%) samples. Discordant results usually were due to the misclassification of cells with similar morphology (such as mesothelial and carcinoma cells) in Sysmex scattergrams. Conclusion: The Sysmex XT\u20102000iV provides a precise and accurate TNCC and has moderate concordance with cytologic findings for classifying canine and feline effusions. Although microscopic examination of effusions is necessary to achieve an accurate diagnosis, the Sysmex can provide preliminary information that may be helpful to cytopathologists.","publish_time":"2009-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinto da Cunha, Nazar\u00E9; Giordano, Alessia; Caniatti, Mario; Paltrinieri, Saverio","journal":"Vet Clin Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f37fe2c3cc0a803a598e5c3e252f7d5d1ada7b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169270.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19192260/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-165x.2008.00107.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjsxNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNCC","TNC","Sysmex"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sysmex XT","Sysmex scattergrams","feline effusions","exception of effusions","cats","feline intracavitary effusions","cytologic findings","microscopic examination of effusions","accurate TNCC","Linearity of TNCC","cytologic examination","dogs","impedance counter","canine","diagnoses","impedance technology","algorithm","Discordant results","Objectives","Total nucleated cell count","feline infectious peritonitis","moderate concordance","carcinoma cells","RBC count","accurate diagnosis","misclassification of cells","delta","interassay coefficients of variation","Intra\u2010assay","HCT","similar morphology","laser","study","hematology analyzer","preliminary information","analytical performance","correlation","qualitative data","TNC values","limit of detection","proportional error","SEAC","Effusion classification","cytopathologists","Imprecision","Methods","usefulness","variable","Background","Conclusion","comparison","samples"],"language":"en"},

While platelet activation and elevated platelet counts (thrombocytosis) are associated with increased risk of thrombotic complications, low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and several platelet function disorders increase the risk of bleeding. Over the last years, more and more evidence has emerged that platelets and their activation state can also modulate innate and adaptive immune responses and low platelet counts have been identified as a surrogate marker for poor prognosis in septic patients. Viral infections often coincide with platelet activation. Host inflammatory responses result in the release of platelet activating mediators and a pro-oxidative and pro-coagulant environment, which favors platelet activation. However, viruses can also directly interact with platelets and megakaryocytes and modulate their function. Furthermore, platelets can be activated by viral antigen\u2013antibody complexes and in response to some viruses B-lymphocytes also generate anti-platelet antibodies. All these processes contributing to platelet activation result in increased platelet consumption and removal and often lead to thrombocytopenia, which is frequently observed during viral infection. However, virus-induced platelet activation does not only modulate platelet count but also shape immune responses. Platelets and their released products have been reported to directly and indirectly suppress infection and to support virus persistence in response to certain viruses, making platelets a double-edged sword during viral infections.

We evaluated 5 different CC strains for outcomes of long-term infection (3 months) and acute vs. early chronic infection (7 vs. 28 days post-infection), using neurological and behavioral phenotyping tests and histology. We correlated phenotypic observations with haplotypes of genomic regions previously linked to TMEV susceptibility to test the hypothesis that genomic diversity within CC mice results in variable disease phenotypes in response to TMEV. None of the 5 strains analyzed had a response identical to that of any other CC strain or inbred strain for which prior data are available, indicating that strains of the CC can produce novel models of neurological disease. Thus, CC strains can be a powerful resource for studying how viral infection can cause different neurological outcomes depending on host genetic background.","publish_time":"2017-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brinkmeyer-Langford, Candice L.; Rech, Raquel; Amstalden, Katia; Kochan, Kelli J.; Hillhouse, Andrew E.; Young, Colin; Welsh, C.

There have been outbreaks not only in the developing world, but also in the developed world among refugees and asylum seekers. Once infested with scabies mites, symptomatic patients, as well as asymptomatic carriers, quickly spread the disease through direct skin-to-skin contact. Typically, symptoms of scabies are characterized by an erythematous, papular, pruritic rash associated with burrows. Treatment of scabies involves using topical or systemic scabicides and treating secondary bacterial infections, if present. Given the prevalence and contagiousness of scabies, measures to prevent its spread are essential. Through application of the novel Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) Tool, emergency medical providers can readily identify risk factors for exposure and important symptoms of the disease, thus limiting its spread through prompt scabicide therapy; isolate the patient until after treatment; and inform local public health authorities and hospital infection prevention, when appropriate. Ultimately, these three actions can aid public health in controlling the transmission of scabies cases, thus ensuring the protection of the general public from this highly contagious skin infestation.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Tabitha A.; Mzahim, Bandr; Koenig, Kristi L.; Alsugair, Abdulrahman; Al-Wabel, Abdussalam; Almutairi, Bandar Saad; Maysa, Eshmawi; Kahn, Christopher A.","journal":"West J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26be3fcc6faf246e9c4ef47c2af9cd1f835bc204.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7081864.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.1.46120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191175/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptoms of scabies","Treatment of scabies","contagiousness of scabies","scabies mites","spread","contagious skin infestation","transmission of scabies cases","direct skin","skin contact","parasitic skin infestation","general public","disease","Isolate","local public health authorities","developed world","important symptoms","developing world","hospital infection prevention","risk factors","systemic scabicides","secondary bacterial infections","exposure","Sarcoptes scabiei","measures","emergency medical providers","symptomatic patients","papular","pruritic rash","refugees","asylum seekers","hominis","prompt scabicide therapy","protection","asymptomatic carriers","burrows","Tool","present","prevalence","application","novel","actions","itch mite"],"language":"en"},

A comparative evaluation of the H1-specific RTLAMP assay vis-\u00E0-vis the World Health Organization-approved real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), involving 239 acute-phase throat swab samples, demonstrated exceptionally higher sensitivity by picking up all of the 116 H1N1-positive cases and 36 additional positive cases among the negatives that were sequence-confirmed as S-OIV H1N1. None of the real-time RTPCR-positive samples were missed by the RTLAMP system. The comparative analysis revealed that S-OIV RTLAMP was up to tenfold more sensitive than the World Health Organization real-time RTPCR; it had a detection limit of 0.1 tissue culture infectious dosage of (50)/ml. One of the most attractive features of this isothermal gene amplification assay is that it seems to have an advantage in monitoring gene amplification by means of SYBR Green I dye-mediated naked-eye visualization within 30 minutes compared to 2 to 3 hours for a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. This suggests that the RTLAMP assay is a valuable tool for rapid, real-time detection and quantification of S-OIV in acute-phase throat swab samples without requiring sophisticated equipment.","publish_time":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parida, Manmohan; Shukla, Jyoti; Sharma, Shashi; Ranghia Santhosh, Sanna; Ravi, Vasanthapuram; Mani, Reeta; Thomas, Maria; Khare, Shashi; Rai, Arvind; Kant Ratho, Radha; Pujari, Sujit; Mishra, Bijayanti; Lakshmana Rao, Putcha Venkata; Vijayaraghavan, Rajagopalan","journal":"The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4a486f57b9e37bb7cc108175f6190170f504758.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0b35b06902127f13fe98623b233abddea9e80f16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3069812.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21227400/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525157810000176; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2010.11.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525157810000176","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health","World Health Organization","SYBR Green"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S-OIV RTLAMP","S-OIV H1N1","quantitative S-OIV","real-time detection","quantification of S","differentiation of S","H1-specific RTLAMP assay","real-time RTPCR-positive samples","World Health Organization real-time RTPCR","clinical diagnosis of S","isothermal gene amplification assay","H1 gene","RTLAMP system","real-time polymerase chain reaction","H1N1-positive cases","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","isothermal amplification","Rapid detection","monitoring gene amplification","acute-phase throat swab samples","specific H1 reverse transcription loop","detection limit","additional positive cases","H1N1 virus","seasonal influenza","serious global health threat","comparative evaluation","comparative analysis","swine-origin influenza","patient management","valuable tool","hours","tissue culture infectious dosage","SYBR Green","single-tube","sophisticated equipment","attractive features","minutes","control","negatives","sequence","naked-eye visualization","recent emergence","higher sensitivity","epidemics","advantage","one-step","article"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to evaluate procalcitonin (PCT) for the diagnosis and prognosis of sepsis using SEPSIS\u20103. METHODS: We enrolled 248 patients, who were admitted to the emergency department with suspected bacterial infection from June 2016 to February 2017. Definite bacterial infection was defined by proven culture results, and probable bacterial infection was based on diagnostic modalities other than culture. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more from the baseline was diagnosed as sepsis. PCT was measured by the AFIAS\u20106 immunoassay system (Boditech Med Inc.) using whole blood. White blood cell (WBC), C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ERS) were evaluated. RESULTS: The final diagnosis was sepsis in 185 patients with infection of respiratory and genitourinary tract constituted 84.6%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was as follows: PCT, 0.682 (0.589\u20100.765); CRP, 0.583 (0.487\u20100.673); ESR, 0.540 (0.515\u20100.699); and WBC, 0.611 (0.455\u20100.633), respectively. In multivariate analysis, age, SOFA, and PCT (log scale) predicted non\u2010survivors with an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval of 1.055 (1.008\u20101.105), 1.303 (1.142\u20101.486), and 2.004 (1.240\u20103.238), respectively. Among sepsis group, initial PCT was increased in non\u2010survivor (23.2 ng/dL) compared to survivor group (8.1 ng/dL) with statistical significance (P = .005).

Abstract The PCR assays are currently used in diagnosis of enterovirus (EV) meningitis. Nevertheless, the use of molecular diagnosis of EV should be investigated in respiratory tract infections (RTI). Objectives To perform enterovirus molecular diagnostic tools, PCR and genotyping, in nasal samples for diagnostic and epidemiologic purposes. Methods During 2008, 3612 nasal specimen (NS) were studied by IFD and MRC5 culture. Next, we realised successively viral isolation on HuH7 culture (for NS negative by IFD assay) and a duplex PCR enterovirus-rhinovirus for the 816 HuH7 positive supernatants. Furthermore, 327 NS collected from neonates were systematically tested by a real-time RT-PCR. This assay was used in routine for EV diagnosis setting in cerebrospinal fluid. Enterovirus genotyping was then performed for the 68 positive supernatants. Results Thirty-five NS (0.97%) were positive for EV by culture (MRC5). A combination of both PCR assays, PEVRV and PEV, allowed an additional identification of 41 EV, eight EV-RV and 12 RV, increasing the number of positive to 96 NS (2.6%). Among the neonates, 32 NS (11.3%) were positive for EV by PEV. Of the 98 NS tested by the two PCR assays (PEV and PEVRV), 27 were positive and we detected 10 EV, five EV-RV and 12 RV. From January to December 2008, the circulation of EV showed the usual peak in June\u2013July when a small outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred and an additional autumnal peak corresponding to respiratory tract infections. Five main serotypes were isolated: 19 EV68 (29.7%), 12 CB3 (18.7%), nine E3 (14,1%), six CA9 (9.4%) and six CB1 (9.4%); the 19 EV68 were isolated in October\u2013November and 17/19 (89.5%) of positive patients were hospitalised for severe respiratory diseases. Conclusion The use of molecular screening techniques (PCR assays and genotyping) on nasal samples collected from patients with respiratory infections allowed a prospective, effective and precise identification of circulating strains.","publish_time":"2011-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petitjean-Lecherbonnier, J.; Dina, J.; Nguyen, E.; Gouarin, S.; Lebigot, E.; Vabret, A.","journal":"Pathologie Biologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44a91b67367d6eabb2ddc136fa8364dd81348bb4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126958.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811410000970; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0369811410000970","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["\u00E0 ent\u00E9rovirus","Dans","De","De janvier \u00E0","Les","Les m\u00E9thodes de"],"organizations":["\u00E0 EV","PEV","Un","Chez les NN","SN","PCR","EV","IFD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EV diagnosis","cinq EV-RV et","circulation of EV","PCR et g\u00E9notypage","PCR EV temps r\u00E9el","PEVRV et PEV","PCR assays","diagnostic et l\u2019\u00E9pid\u00E9miologie","et une PCR duplex ent\u00E9rorhinovirus","deux PCR","use of molecular diagnosis of EV","HuH7 culture","SN test\u00E9es par PEV et PEVRV","MRC5 culture","infections respiratoires \u00E0 EV est encore mal d\u00E9finie","clinique et \u00E9conomique","\u00E9taient positives et nous avons d\u00E9tect\u00E9 dix EV","positive patients","R\u00E9sultats Trente-cinq EV ont \u00E9t\u00E9 isol\u00E9s en culture","duplex PCR enterovirus-rhinovirus","culture HuH7 pr\u00E9sentant","real-time RT-PCR","HuH7 positive supernatants","s\u00E9cr\u00E9tions nasales ont eu une recherche virale par IFD et culture MRC5","EV68 sont tous isol\u00E9s en octobre \u00E0 novembre et","diagnostic mol\u00E9culaires","positif \u00E0","infections neurom\u00E9ning\u00E9es \u00E0 ent\u00E9rovirus","PCR est bien reconnue","respiratory tract infections","NS negative","number of positive","pic estival habituel d\u2019infections m\u00E9ning\u00E9es et","sont r\u00E9alis\u00E9s une recherche virale sur culture HuH7","RV suppl\u00E9mentaires","diagnosis of enterovirus","enterovirus molecular diagnostic tools","janvier \u00E0 d\u00E9cembre","Enterovirus genotyping","SN sont positives avec","cultures MRC5 ou HuH7","SN n\u00E9gative en","patients pr\u00E9sentant une identification d\u2019EV sur surnageants","IFD assay","nouveau-n\u00E9s ont eu une recherche syst\u00E9matique","patients positifs ont \u00E9t\u00E9 hospitalis\u00E9s avec","pic automnal correspondant d\u2019infections respiratoires","souches circulantes dans","biologie mol\u00E9culaire dans","\u00E9t\u00E9 r\u00E9alis\u00E9 chez","additional identification","neonates","CB3","CA9","CB1","temps relativement court","additional autumnal peak","Cinq s\u00E9rotypes pr\u00E9dominent","severe respiratory diseases","outils mol\u00E9culaires","nasal samples","nasal specimen","usual peak","neuf E3","permettent d\u2019identifier pr\u00E9cis\u00E9ment","permis d\u2019identifier respectivement","M\u00E9thodes Au cours","small outbreak of aseptic meningitis","distribution saisonni\u00E8re montre","b\u00E9n\u00E9fice \u00E9pid\u00E9miologique","l\u2019ann\u00E9e","apportant","place","l\u2019utilisation","signes d\u2019insuffisance respiratoire aigu\u00EB","apports","techniques","maison","nombre","utilis\u00E9e","Objectifs D\u00E9finir","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Alors que","sant\u00E9","epidemiologic purposes","Objectives","routine","Parmi","ECP","combinaison","cerebrospinal fluid","viral isolation","main serotypes","Methods","Conclusion","RTI","combination","plus","Results","use of molecular screening techniques","genotyping","respiratory infections","patients","precise identification of circulating strains"],"language":"en"},

BAG3 is the only member of the family to be induced by stressful stimuli, mainly through the activity of heat shock factor 1 on bag3 gene promoter. In addition to the BAG domain, BAG3 contains also a WW domain and a proline-rich (PXXP) repeat, that mediate binding to partners different from Hsp70. These multifaceted interactions underlie BAG3 ability to modulate major biological processes, that is, apoptosis, development, cytoskeleton organization and autophagy, thereby mediating cell adaptive responses to stressful stimuli. In normal cells, BAG3 is constitutively present in a very few cell types, including cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle cells, in which the protein appears to contribute to cell resistance to mechanical stress. A growing body of evidence indicate that BAG3 is instead expressed in several tumor types. In different tumor contexts, BAG3 protein was reported to sustain cell survival, resistance to therapy, and/or motility and metastatization. In some tumor types, down-modulation of BAG3 levels was shown, as a proof-of-principle, to inhibit neoplastic cell growth in animal models. This review attempts to outline the emerging mechanisms that can underlie some of the biological activities of the protein, focusing on implications in tumor progression.","publish_time":"2011-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosati, A; Graziano, V; De Laurenzi, V; Pascale, M; Turco, M C","journal":"Cell Death Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca8b14f351edca29473646f4bb9669c3ad03500c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3122056.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21472004/; https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2011.24","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BAG3 protein","BAG3 ability","cell types","bag3 gene promoter","modulation of BAG3 levels","cell resistance","BAG domain","tumor types","heat shock protein","cell survival","ATPase domain","WW domain","tumor progression","neoplastic cell growth","cell adaptive responses","different tumor contexts","stressful stimuli","member of BAG family of co-chaperones","activity of heat shock factor","partners different","normal cells","biological activities","major biological processes","skeletal muscle cells","autophagy","repeat","binding","apoptosis","proline-rich","cardiomyocytes","cytoskeleton organization","PXXP","development","principle","animal models","therapy","Bcl2-associated athanogene","multifaceted interactions","review attempts","emerging mechanisms","Hsp70","growing body of evidence","mechanical stress","implications","addition","amino acids","motility","proof","metastatization"],"language":"en"},

Their function during virus entry and budding is understood only incompletely. We summarize current knowledge of their primary structure, membrane topology, (co-translational) processing and intracellular targeting to membranes of the exocytic pathway, which are the budding site. We profoundly describe experimental data that led to widely believed conceptions about the function of these proteins and also report new results about processing steps for each glycoprotein. Further, we depict the location and characteristics of epitopes in the membrane proteins since the late appearance of neutralizing antibodies may lead to persistence, a characteristic hallmark of arterivirus infection. Some molecular features of the arteriviral proteins are rare or even unique from a cell biological point of view, particularly the prevention of signal peptide cleavage by co-translational glycosylation, discovered in EAV-Gp3, and the efficient use of overlapping sequons for glycosylation. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of these cellular processes. Based on this, we present hypotheses on the structure and variability of arteriviral membrane proteins and their role during virus entry and budding.","publish_time":"2014-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Veit, Michael; Matczuk, Anna Karolina; Sinhadri, Balaji Chandrasekhar; Krause, Eberhard; Thaa, Bastian","journal":"Virus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a143c5a5443eec007a768c856179c261dc0ec41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172906.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214003979; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214003979; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.09.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25278143/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["arteriviral proteins","multitude of membrane proteins","variability of arteriviral membrane proteins","virus entry","membrane topology","co-translational glycosylation","respiratory syndrome virus","equine arteritis virus","budding site","function","arterivirus particles","primary structure","EAV-Gp3","processing steps","ORF5a protein","molecular mechanisms","molecular features","hydrophobic E protein","characteristic hallmark of arterivirus infection","intracellular targeting","prevention of signal peptide cleavage","PRRSV","role","persistence","membranes","exocytic pathway","cell biological point of view","efficient use of overlapping sequons","late appearance of neutralizing antibodies","important pathogens","new results","limited genome size","complex","characteristics of epitopes","Gp5","current knowledge","veterinary medicine","Gp2","cellular processes","glycoprotein","present hypotheses","Arteriviruses","conceptions","location","experimental data"],"language":"en"},

Coronaviruses specifically package genomic RNA into assembled virions, and in SARS-CoV, it is reported that this process is driven by an interaction between the N-protein and a packaging signal encoded within the viral RNA. While recent studies have uncovered the sequence of this packaging signal, little is known about the specific interaction between the N-protein and the packaging signal sequence, and the mechanisms by which this interaction drives viral genome packaging. In this study, we developed a novel in vivo cell-based assay for examining this interaction between the N-protein and packaging signal RNA for SARS-CoV, as well as other viruses within the coronaviridae family. Our results demonstrate that the N-protein specifically recognizes the SARS-CoV packaging signal with greater affinity compared to signals from other coronaviruses or non-coronavirus species. We also use deletion mapping to identify a 151-nt region within the packaging signal sequence that is critical for N-protein-RNA binding, and conversely, we show that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the N protein are necessary for recognizing the packaging RNA. These results describe, for the first time, in vivo evidence for an interaction between the SARS-CoV N-protein and its packaging signal RNA, and demonstrate the feasibility of using this cell-based assay to further probe viral RNA-protein interactions in future studies.","publish_time":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woo, Jiwon; Lee, Eunice Yoojin; Lee, Mirae; Kim, Taeyeon; Cho, Yong-Eun","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e74c09fac1f951aa3859885662c702089ba95c80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092827.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594639/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X19318534; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X19318534; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.09.115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ0LmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1700478,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:34Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Jw2VvEOtdTOrdRGhub3j7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_44.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N protein","packaging RNA","packaging signal RNA","SARS-CoV N-protein","SARS-CoV packaging signal","packaging signal sequence","N-terminal","viral genome packaging","probe viral RNA-protein interactions","genomic RNA","RNA binding","SARS-CoV nucleocapsid","viral replication","specific interaction","viral genome complex","cell-based assay","Coronaviruses","results","future studies","recent studies","C-terminal domains","multiple functions","signals","transcription","assembly","greater affinity","assembled virions","mechanisms","nt region","feasibility","non-coronavirus species","time","evidence","coronaviridae family","deletion mapping","study","process"],"language":"en"},

A 4-year-old, female Asian palm civet was found dead by the owner. At necropsy, large amount of adipose tissue was found in the subcutis and in the peritoneal cavity. Most of the pancreas appeared red, translucent. Hepatomegaly, discoloration of the liver were evident, with multifocal areas of degeneration, characterized by white nodular lesions. Histologically, the pancreas showed severe interstitial and perilobular necrosis and extensive haemorrhages, with separation of the interstitium, mild reactive inflammation at the periphery of the pancreatic lobules. Liver showed multifocal foci of vacuolar degeneration, lipidic accumulation, sometimes associated to hepatocyte necrosis.

This chapter illustrates that a complex array of defensive mechanisms protect the lungs against the adverse effects of airborne substances and pathogenic organisms. In contrast to the adverse pulmonary effects of cigarette smoke and industrial pollutants, therapeutic agents remain a relatively minor cause of pulmonary toxicity in man although, actual incidence is difficult to ascertain. However, drug-induced pulmonary disease appears to be an increasingly frequent clinical problem and the drugs associated with parenchymal pulmonary injury in humans continue to increase. The development of drugs to be administered by inhalation or intranasal routes is particularly difficult because of the perceived risks of high local drug concentration in respiratory tissues, alterations to drug disposition and a potentially vulnerable patient population, often with pulmonary disease. Finally, the nasal chambers are the structures, which are first to be subjected to the effects of inhaled substances, whether microorganisms or chemical substances. Moreover, infectious agents cause inflammation in the nose and nasal sinuses, and this may be associated with inflammation in the conjunctiva, middle ear and oral cavity.","publish_time":"2000-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greaves, Peter","journal":"Histopathology of Preclinical Toxicity Studies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2a6bc16a0c088224ea1428da90c217e24e89924.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978044450514950005X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978044450514950005X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pulmonary disease","adverse pulmonary effects of cigarette smoke","effects of inhaled substances","parenchymal pulmonary injury","adverse effects of airborne substances","minor cause of pulmonary toxicity","drug disposition","chemical substances","inflammation","chapter","respiratory tissues","therapeutic agents","respiratory tract","infectious agents","development of drugs","nasal sinuses","nasal chambers","perceived risks of high local drug concentration","industrial pollutants","lungs","alterations","vulnerable patient population","conjunctiva","middle ear","nose","microorganisms","complex array of defensive mechanisms","actual incidence","pathogenic organisms","oral cavity","inhalation","Publisher Summary","frequent clinical problem","intranasal routes","humans","contrast","structures"],"language":"en"},

Reflecting on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak that was first identified in Wuhan, China, we discuss the opportunities, technical challenges, and foreseeable controversies for deploying urban intelligence during a pandemic. Finally, we emphasize the urgency of building urban intelligence through cross-disciplinary research and collaborative practice on a global scale.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Yuan; Yeung, Wesley; Celi, Leo Anthony","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159057.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/18873; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32248145/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["urban intelligence","level information","pandemic outbreak","urban data applications","integrated pandemic response","importance of city","overview of city","disease outbreaks","coronavirus disease","cross-disciplinary research","Previous epidemic management research","collaborative practice","combination","foreseeable controversies","limited expertise","people","operational capacity","opportunities","technical challenges","movement","facilities","global scale","components","COVID","urgency","China","Wuhan","engagement","paper"],"language":"en"},

Hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination therapy is currently tested for curing Covid-19, with promising results. However, the molecular mechanism of action of this combination is not established yet. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we show that both drugs act in synergy to prevent any close contact between the virus and the plasma membrane of host cells. We reveal unexpected molecular similarity between azithromycin and the sugar moiety of GM1, a lipid raft ganglioside acting as a host attachment cofactor for respiratory viruses. Due to this mimicry, azithromycin interacts with the ganglioside-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This binding site shared by azithromycin and GM1 displays a conserved amino acid triad Q-134/F-135/N-137 located at the tip of the spike protein. We also show that hydroxychloroquine molecules can saturate virus attachment sites on gangliosides in the vicinity of the primary coronavirus receptor ACE-2. Taken together, these data show that azithromycin is directed against the virus, whereas hydroxychloroquine is directed against cellular attachment cofactors. We conclude that both drugs act as competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the host cell membrane. This is consistent with a synergistic antiviral mechanism at the plasma membrane level, where the most efficient therapeutic intervention probably stands. This molecular mechanism may explain the beneficial effects of hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin combination therapy in patients with Covid-19. Incidentally, our data suggest that the conserved Q-134/F-135/N-137 triad could be considered as a target for vaccine strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fantini, Jacques; Chahinian, Henri; Yahi, Nouara","journal":"Int J Antimicrob Agents","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fbd2ab26d6789477da19a74381732d110b0caf5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7219429.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857920301837; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920301837?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405156/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["azithromycin combination therapy","SARS-CoV","host attachment cofactor","virus attachment sites","molecular mechanism of action","coronavirus disease","hydroxychloroquine molecules","emergence of SARS","molecular dynamics","host cell membrane","plasma membrane of host cells","ganglioside-binding domain of SARS","beneficial effects of hydroxychloroquine","plasma membrane level","competitive inhibitors of SARS","cellular attachment cofactors","conserved Q","drugs act","unexpected molecular similarity","curing Covid","spike protein","data","synergistic antiviral mechanism","conserved amino acid triad Q","primary coronavirus receptor ACE","binding site","sugar moiety of GM1","lipid raft ganglioside","global pandemic disease","vicinity","gangliosides","simulations","patients","synergy","close contact","respiratory viruses","efficient therapeutic intervention","target","MD","tip","promising results","vaccine strategies","mimicry"],"language":"en"},

Substantial progress has been made over the last decade in developing candidate preventive vaccines that can protect nonhuman primates against EBOV. Among these prospects, a vaccine based on recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is particularly robust, as it can also confer protection when administered as a postexposure treatment. A concern that has been raised regarding the replication-competent VSV vectors that express EBOV glycoproteins is how these vectors would be tolerated by individuals with altered or compromised immune systems such as patients infected with HIV. This is especially important as all EBOV outbreaks to date have occurred in areas of Central and Western Africa with high HIV incidence rates in the population. In order to address this concern, we evaluated the safety of the recombinant VSV vector expressing the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein (VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP) in six rhesus macaques infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV). All six animals showed no evidence of illness associated with the VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP vaccine, suggesting that this vaccine may be safe in immunocompromised populations. While one goal of the study was to evaluate the safety of the candidate vaccine platform, it was also of interest to determine if altered immune status would affect vaccine efficacy. The vaccine protected 4 of 6 SHIV-infected macaques from death following ZEBOV challenge. Evaluation of CD4\u002B T cells in all animals showed that the animals that succumbed to lethal ZEBOV challenge had the lowest CD4\u002B counts, suggesting that CD4\u002B T cells may play a role in mediating protection against ZEBOV.","publish_time":"2008-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geisbert, Thomas W.; Daddario-DiCaprio, Kathleen M.; Lewis, Mark G.; Geisbert, Joan B.; Grolla, Allen; Leung, Anders; Paragas, Jason; Matthias, Lennox; Smith, Mark A.; Jones, Steven M.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Feldmann, Heinz; Jahrling, Peter B.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ff38c46bce64adb553080443f72ff90e61dcbc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2582959.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19043556/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV","ZEBOV"],"locations":["Western Africa","Zaire"],"keyphrases":["ZEBOVGP vaccine","vaccine efficacy","candidate vaccine platform","animals","re-emerging virus","Ebola virus","EBOV outbreaks","SHIV-infected macaques","recombinant VSV vector","simian-human immunodeficiency virus","recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus","express EBOV glycoproteins","lowest CD4","VSV\u0394G","lethal ZEBOV challenge","Evaluation of CD4","T cells","safety","replication-competent VSV vectors","public health concern","rhesus macaques","immune systems","immune status","mediating protection","significant human pathogen","high HIV incidence rates","developing candidate preventive vaccines","Western Africa","Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein","areas of Central","role","counts","death","nonhuman primates","decade","individuals","potential biological weapon","evidence of illness","patients","immunocompromised populations","postexposure treatment","study","prospects","Substantial progress","goal","order"],"language":"en"},

Current asthma management involves a step-up and step-down approach based on asthma control with a large degree of heterogeneity in responses to the main drug classes currently in use: \u03B22-adrenergic receptor agonists, corticosteroids, and leukotriene modifiers. Importantly, asthma is heterogeneous with respect to clinical presentation and the inflammatory mechanisms that underlie it. This heterogeneity likely contributes to variable results in clinical trials, particularly when targeting specific inflammatory mediators. These factors have motivated a drive toward stratified medicine in asthma based on clinical/cellular outcomes or genetics (i.e., pharmacogenetics). Significant progress has been made in identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence the efficacy and potential for adverse effects of all main classes of asthma drugs. Importantly an emerging role for genetics in phase II development of newer therapies has been demonstrated (e.g., anti-IL4). Similarly, the stratification of patients based on clinical characteristics (e.g., blood and sputum eosinophil levels) has been critical in evaluating newer therapies (e.g., anti-IL5). As a proof of concept, anti-IgE is the latest therapy to be introduced into clinical practice, although only for severe, allergic patients (i.e., in a stratified manner). As new asthma genes are identified using genome-wide association, among other technologies, new targets (e.g., IL33/IL33 receptor (IL1RL1)) will emerge and pharmacogenetics in these development programs will be essential. In this chapter we review the current understanding of asthma pathobiology and its clinical presentation, as well as the use of stratified medicine, which holds great promise for maximizing clinical outcomes and minimizing adverse effects in existing and new therapies.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaw, Dominick; Portelli, Michael; Sayers, Ian","journal":"Handbook of Pharmacogenomics and Stratified Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/844e5563f2255a5701d945729aa2d3962cf665cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149851.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123868824000281; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123868824000281","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical outcomes","clinical presentation","asthma control","Abstract Asthma","clinical characteristics","clinical trials","clinical practice","new asthma genes","Current asthma management","main classes of asthma drugs","current understanding of asthma pathobiology","new therapies","use of stratified medicine","development of newer therapies","adverse effects","IL33 receptor","new targets","anti-IgE","anti-IL5","stratified manner","anti-IL4","pharmacogenetics","main drug classes","cellular outcomes","combination of genetic","genetic polymorphisms","development programs","inflammatory mechanisms","stratification of patients","allergic patients","large degree of heterogeneity","specific inflammatory mediators","\u03B22-adrenergic receptor agonists","corticosteroids","complex etiology","common respiratory disease","responses","phase","step-down approach","blood","efficacy","potential","latest therapy","great promise","respect","sputum eosinophil levels","genome-wide association","technologies","variable results","IL1RL1","drive","leukotriene modifiers","proof of concept","emerging role","environmental components","chapter","factors","Significant progress"],"language":"en"},

Viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI) has been previously associated with CLAD development. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation in relation to CLAD development. METHOD: Ninety-eight patients undergoing lung transplantation were prospectively enrolled between 2009 and 2012. They were monitored for infections with predefined intervals and on extra visits during the first year, the total follow-up period ranged between 5 and 8 years. Nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were analyzed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel for respiratory pathogens. Data regarding clinical characteristics and infectious events were recorded. RESULTS: Viral respiratory tract infection during the first year was identified as a risk factor for long-term CLAD development (P = 0.041, hazard ratio 1.94 [1.03-3.66]) in a time-dependent multivariate Cox regression analysis. We also found that coronavirus in particular was associated with increased risk for CLAD development. Other identified risk factors were acute rejection and cyclosporine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation is associated with long-term CLAD development and that coronavirus infections in particular might be a risk factor.","publish_time":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Magnusson, Jesper; Westin, Johan; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Lindh, Magnus; Brittain-Long, Robin; Nord\u00E9n, Rickard; Riise, Gerdt C.","journal":"Transplant Direct","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7ab9571dc69783d3b84dc3c5a24656db182afb6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6092179.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/txd.0000000000000808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30255130/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cox"],"organizations":["VRTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["long-term CLAD development","lung transplantation","long-term effects of VRTI","long-term survival","increased risk","lung transplant recipients","identified risk factors","Viral respiratory tract infection","respiratory pathogens","Chronic lung allograft dysfunction","coronavirus infections","study","major limiting factor","multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel","acute rejection","time-dependent multivariate Cox regression analysis","bronchoalveolar lavage samples","cyclosporine treatment","extra visits","Data","clinical characteristics","infectious events","Nasopharyngeal swab","predefined intervals","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","relation","total follow-up period","METHOD","patients","hazard ratio","main purpose","CONCLUSIONS","years"],"language":"en"},

However, the limitations of RT-PCR, specifically, the fact that it is time-consuming and inadequate for the assessment of disease severity, have affected the process of epidemiological disease containment and has taken a toll on the healthcare management chain. As the risk of infection for other patients and personnel must be kept to a minimum, the indications for imaging have to be carefully considered.

Respirable pathogen-carrying droplets provide a vector for the spatial spread of infection with droplet transport determined by diffusive and convective processes. An epidemiological model describing the spatial dynamics of disease transmission is presented. The effects of an ambient airflow, as an infection control, are incorporated leading to a delay equation, with droplet density dependent on the infectious density at a previous time. It is found that small droplets ( \u223C 0.4 \u03BC m ) generate a negligible infectious force due to the small viral load and the associated duration they require to transmit infection. In contrast, larger droplets ( \u223C 4 \u03BC m ) can lead to an infectious wave propagating through a fully susceptible population or a secondary infection outbreak for a localized susceptible population. Droplet diffusion is found to be an inefficient mode of droplet transport leading to minimal spatial spread of infection. A threshold air velocity is derived, above which disease transmission is impaired even when the basic reproduction number R 0 exceeds unity.","publish_time":"2012-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robinson, Marguerite; Stilianakis, Nikolaos I.; Drossinos, Yannis","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f07ee9dbdc416c882e7753bb115a74c899d4d59.json; document_parses/pdf_json/06cad91161f09a9f28a5f07ecbd84edf3e7a87df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094105.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22207025/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519311006321; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.3490v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.12.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519311006321","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection control","minimal spatial spread of infection","infectious density","Droplet diffusion","spatial dynamics of disease transmission","small droplets","droplet density dependent","secondary infection outbreak","inefficient mode of droplet transport","airborne transmission","larger droplets","localized susceptible population","negligible infectious force","infectious wave propagating","Abstract Disease outbreaks","small viral load","basic reproduction number R","potential","associated duration","delay equation","vector","unity","indoor environments","ambient airflow","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","convective processes","epidemiological model","influenza","previous time","Respirable pathogen","threshold air velocity","H1N1","effects","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) tag is industrially practical for increasing the yield of recombinant proteins by increasing solubility and preventing degradation in expression systems. RESULTS: A new vector system, pKSEC1, was designed to produce AMPs, which can work in prokaryotic systems such as Escherichia coli and plant chloroplasts. 6xHis was tagged to SUMO for purification of SUMO-fused AMPs. Abaecin, a 34-aa-long antimicrobial peptide from honeybees, was expressed in a fusion form to 6xHis-SUMO in a new vector system to evaluate the prokaryotic expression platform of the antimicrobial peptides. The fusion sequences were codon-optimized in three different combinations and expressed in E. coli. The combination of the native SUMO sequence with codon-optimized abaecin showed the highest expression level among the three combinations, and most of the expressed fusion proteins were detected in soluble fractions. Cleavage of the SUMO tag by sumoase produced a 29-aa-long abaecin derivative with a C-terminal deletion. However, this abaecin derivative still retained the binding sequence for its target protein, DnaK. Antibacterial activity of the 29-aa long abaecin was tested against Bacillus subtilis alone or in combination with cecropin B. The combined treatment of the abaecin derivative and cecropin B showed bacteriolytic activity 2 to 3 times greater than that of abaecin alone. CONCLUSIONS: Using a SUMO-tag with an appropriate codon-optimization strategy could be an approach for the production of antimicrobial peptides in E.coli without affecting the viability of the host cell.

Vaccinations and therapies are only available for relatively few virus infections and not always where they are needed. However, knowledge of transmission routes can prevent virus infection. In the context of this study, we measured the effects of a secondary school education module, named Viruskenner, on knowledge, attitude, and risk behavior as these relate to virus infections. A nonrandomized intervention study was conducted between April and August 2015 to assess the effect of this 2-month education module on knowledge, attitude, and behavior of 684 secondary school students in the Netherlands, Suriname, and Indonesia. For the Netherlands, a control group of a further 184 students was added. Factor analysis was performed on questions pertaining to attitude and behavior. Comparative analyses between pre- and posttest per country were done using multiple linear regression, independent sample T-tests, and one-way analysis of variance. These showed a significant increase in knowledge about virus infections and the prevention of infectious diseases among the Dutch and Surinamese groups, whereas a trend of increased knowledge was evident among the Indonesian participants. The Dutch control group showed an overall decrease in knowledge. Regression analyses showed that there was a significant interaction effect between participation and time on knowledge, attitude, and awareness and behavior and risk infection. Attitudes improved significantly in the intervention group. Pearson correlation coefficients between knowledge, attitude, and behavior were found to be positive.","publish_time":"2017-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doornekamp, Laura; Stegers-Jager, Karen M.; Vlek, Odette M.; Klop, Tanja; Goeijenbier, Marco; van Gorp, Eric C.

Autophagy, a conserved lysosomal degradation pathway, is a cell survival mechanism invoked in response to environmental and cellular stress. Autophagy is inferred to have been present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor and only to have been lost by some obligatory intracellular parasites. As such, autophagy represents a unifying biology, subserving survival and the earliest host defense strategies, predating apoptosis, within eukaryotes.

We developed a general method that predicts interactions between virus and host proteins using the repeat patterns and composition of amino acids.

In September 2013 to August 2014, 335 nasopharyngeal aspirates from children below 14 with bronchiolitis and pneumonia were screened for HRV and 13 other respiratory viruses by PCR or reverse transcription PCR. Interferon (IFN)\u2010\u03B3, interleukin (IL)\u20102, IL\u20104, IL\u20106, IL\u201010, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010\u03B1 were detected by multiplex enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay. HRVs were found in 66 cases (19.7%), including 35 bronchiolitis and 31 pneumonia cases. Compared with the RSV alone group, children with pneumonia had more frequent wheezing episodes in HRV (P (a) = .001) and HRV \u002B non\u2010RSV (P (b) = .002) groups, and fever in the HRV (P (f) = .004) and HRV \u002B RSV (P (g) = .005) groups. Among patients with bronchiolitis, cases with HRV alone were more likely to present in winter than those with RSV alone (P (i) = .010) and HRV \u002B non\u2010RSV (P (j) = .014), and less numerous in summer compared with HRV \u002B non\u2010RSV (P (h) = .005). Children with HRV alone were more susceptible to have a history of eczema than RSV alone among bronchiolitis (P (c) \u003C .001) and pneumonia (P (e) = .033) cases.

Such alerts are rare; however, on Feb 19, 2003, a pandemic alert was issued in response to human infections caused by an avian H5N1 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/213/03. H5N1 had been noted once before in human beings in 1997 and killed a third (6/18) of infected people. 1,2 The 2003 variant seemed to have been transmitted directly from birds to human beings and caused fatal pneumonia in one of two infected individuals. Candidate vaccines were sought, but no avirulent viruses antigenically similar to the pathogen were available, and the isolate killed embryonated chicken eggs. Since traditional strategies of vaccine production were not viable, we sought to produce a candidate reference virus using reverse genetics. Methods We removed the polybasic aminoacids that are associated with high virulence from the haemagglutinin cleavage site of A/Hong Kong/213/03 using influenza reverse genetics techniques. A reference vaccine virus was then produced on an A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) backbone on WHO-approved Vero cells. We assessed this reference virus for pathogenicity in in-vivo and in-vitro assays. Findings A reference vaccine virus was produced in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-grade facilities in less than 4 weeks from the time of virus isolation. This virus proved to be non-pathogenic in chickens and ferrets and was shown to be stable after multiple passages in embryonated chicken eggs. Interpretation The ability to produce a candidate reference virus in such a short period of time sets a new standard for rapid response to emerging infectious disease threats and clearly shows the usefulness of reverse genetics for influenza vaccine development. The same technologies and procedures are currently being used to create reference vaccine viruses against the 2004 H5N1 viruses circulating in Asia.","publish_time":"2004-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Webby, RJ; Perez, DR; Coleman, JS; Guan, Y; Knight, JH; Govorkova, EA; McClain-Moss, LR; Peiris, JS; Rehg, JE; Tuomanen, EI; Webster, RG","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58e5b4767a000ba416763edd6ca1c5f1fba9a42c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112480.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673604158923; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604158923","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Good Manufacturing Practice"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["candidate reference virus","reference vaccine viruses","avian H5N1 influenza virus","time of virus isolation","influenza vaccine development","H5N1 viruses","rapid response","influenza reverse genetics techniques","human beings","usefulness of reverse genetics","Hong Kong","embryonated chicken eggs","traditional strategies of vaccine production","human infections","avirulent viruses","Candidate vaccines","pandemic alert","infected individuals","infected people","short period of time","emergence of severe infection capable of rapid global spread","new standard","Good Manufacturing Practice","haemagglutinin cleavage site","high virulence","backbone","GMP","infectious disease threats","isolate","multiple passages","fatal pneumonia","weeks","grade facilities","PR8","ability","polybasic aminoacids","approved Vero cells","ferrets","Summary Background","chickens","birds","Findings","Puerto Rico","Methods","Interpretation","Asia","pathogenicity","alerts","vitro assays","technologies","procedures","variant"],"language":"en"},

Seabirds are particularly interesting hosts in this respect. In addition to incredible long-distance movements during migration, foraging and prospecting, these birds are long-lived, site faithful and breed in dense aggregations in specific colony locations. These different characteristics can favor both the local maintenance and large-scale dissemination of parasites and pathogens. The Iles Eparses provide breeding and feeding grounds for more than 3 million breeding pairs of seabirds including at least 13 species. Breeding colonies on these islands are relatively undisturbed by human activities and represent natural metapopulations in which seabird population dynamics, movement and dispersal can be studied in relation to that of circulating parasites and pathogens. In this review, we summarize previous knowledge and recently-acquired data on the parasites and pathogens found in association with seabirds of the Iles Eparses. These studies have revealed the presence of a rich diversity of infectious agents (viruses, bacteria and parasites) carried by the birds and/or their local ectoparasites (ticks and louse flies). Many of these agents are widespread and found in other ecosystems confirming a role for seabirds in their large scale dissemination and maintenance. The heterogeneous distribution of parasites and infectious agents among islands and seabird species suggests that relatively independent metacommunities of interacting species may exist within the western Indian Ocean. In this context, we discuss how the patterns and determinants of seabird movements may alter parasite and pathogen circulation. We conclude by outlining key aspects for future research given the baseline data now available and current concerns in eco-epidemiology and biodiversity conservation.","publish_time":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCoy, Karen D.; Dietrich, Muriel; Jaeger, Audrey; Wilkinson, David A.; Bastien, Matthieu; Lagadec, Erwan; Boulinier, Thierry; Pascalis, Herv\u00E9; Tortosa, Pablo; Le Corre, Matthieu; Dellagi, Koussay; Lebarbenchon, Camille","journal":"Acta Oecologica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b376aa9443596f299e7ddaaa123b4c811ea89c77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128210.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288503/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X1530062X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1146609X1530062X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2015.12.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Indian Ocean"],"keyphrases":["pathogens","disseminators of parasites","circulating parasites","seabird species","large-scale dissemination of parasites","heterogeneous distribution of parasites","breeding pairs of seabirds","role of birds","determinants of seabird movements","islands","local maintenance","Iles Eparses","Breeding colonies","rich diversity of infectious agents","seabird population dynamics","baseline data","local ectoparasites","independent metacommunities of interacting species","incredible long-distance movements","large scale dissemination","current concerns","dense aggregations","natural metapopulations","eco-epidemiology","site faithful","viruses","future research","migration","human activities","dispersal","reservoirs","specific colony locations","association","biodiversity conservation","years","addition","presence","ticks","louse flies","patterns","prospecting","attention","bacteria","grounds","key aspects","pathogen circulation","past","previous knowledge","western Indian Ocean","interesting hosts","relation","ecosystems","high vagility","different characteristics","review","respect","studies","context"],"language":"en"},

It is generally assumed that there is a direct relationship between antibody accessibility to antigens and accessible surface of proteins. Based on this assumption, prediction systems often includes solvent accessibility values calculated from the primary sequence of proteins or from their three dimensional structures as a predictive criterion. However, the current prediction systems seem weakly efficient in view of benchmark tests. We were interested in evaluating how amino acids that have been experimentally identified as epitopic elements could differ from the rest of the antigenic molecule at the level of surface exposure, hence we assessed the average accessibility of epitopes. The approach used here utilises published epitopes deduced from numerous identification techniques, including sequence scanning and structure visualisation after crystallography, and it involves many types of antigens from toxins to allergens. Our results show that epitopic residues are not distributed among any specific Relative Surface Accessibility and Protrusion Index values and that, in some cases, epitopes cover the entire antigenic sequence.

In conclusion, these assays offer an efficient and reliable tool for identification and subtyping of influenza A virus (subtype H1 and H3) in the resource-limited setting.","publish_time":"2018-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Ning; Wang, Weiping; Wang, Jie; Yao, Xinyue; Chen, Fangfang; Li, Xiaojun; Yinglei, Yi; Chen, Bo","journal":"Mol Cell Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c2b4f81e34c3895ccc3eb63df654cc00dd93615.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127182.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850818301890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30394299/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850818301890; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2018.10.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-RPA","RPA-LFD assays","real-time RT-PCR assays","sensitivity of RT","conventional RT-PCR","H1 HA gene","H3 HA gene","copies","reaction","influenza","virus","matrix gene","subtype H1","subtypes H1","identification","reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assays","assays\u2019 specificity","lateral flow dipsticks","genes","reliable tool","hemagglutinin","resource-limited setting","results","cross-reactivity","limits of detection","targets","Assessment","conclusion","samples","RIDTs"],"language":"en"},

However, a \u2018mismatch between present professional competencies and the requirements of an increasingly interdependent world\u2019 has been identified. Postgraduate training should take account of the increasingly global nature of health; this paper examines the extent to which they currently do. DESIGN: Trainees across 11 medical specialties reviewed the content of their postgraduate curriculum. SETTING: Not relevant. PARTCIPANTS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Competencies were coded as \u2018UK\u2019 (statement only relevant to UK work), \u2018global\u2019 (statement with an explicit reference to aspects of health outside the UK) or generic (relevant both to the UK and international settings). RESULTS: Six of the 11 curricula reviewed contained global health competencies. These covered the global burden or determinants of disease and appropriate policy responses. Only one College required trainees to \u2018be aware of the World Health Organization\u2019, or \u2018know the local, national and international structures for health care\u2019. These cross-cutting competencies have applicability to all specialties. All 11 curricula contained generic competencies where a global health perspective and/or experience could be advantageous, e.g. caring for migrant or culturally different patients. CONCLUSION: Trainees in all specialties should achieve a minimum requirement of global health awareness. This can be achieved through a small number of common competencies that are consistent across core curricula. These should lead on from equivalent undergraduate competencies. Addressing the current gap in the global health content of postgraduate medical curricula will ensure that the UK has health professionals that are trained to meet the health challenges of the future.","publish_time":"2013-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hall, JA; Brown, CS; Pettigrew, L; Malik, ANJ; Watson, J; Topiwala, A; McGregor, L; Ramsay, R","journal":"JRSM Short Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f5c8e7b610ecc3b139756ce244a25c699d33946.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3616298.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23560218/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2042533313476421","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","College","World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global health competencies","global health perspective","global nature of health","aspects of health","health care","health challenges","health professionals","global health content of postgraduate medical curricula","World Health Organization","global burden","generic competencies","minimum requirement of global health awareness","present professional competencies","UK work","equivalent undergraduate competencies","Trainees","medical specialties","small number of common competencies","core curricula","statement","Postgraduate training","postgraduate curriculum","international structures","international settings","interdependent world","determinants of disease","requirements","appropriate policy responses","explicit reference","account","paper","experience","current gap","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES","mismatch","applicability","DESIGN","different patients","College","future","extent","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","PARTCIPANTS"],"language":"en"},

However, few studies of infection control have specifically addressed EMPs in the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea). The goal of this study was to assess the current status of infection prevention and control programs (IPCPs) for EMPs in Korea. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted to quantitatively assess the resources and activities of IPCPs. A total of 907 EMPs in five metropolitan cities completed a structured questionnaire from September 2014 to January 2015. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, multi-response analysis, and the chi-square test. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 34.8\u00B115.1 years. IPCPs were found to have weaknesses with regard to the following resources: the assignment of infection control personnel (ICP) (79.5%), hand hygiene resources such as waterless antiseptics (79.3%), the use of paper towels (38.9%), personal protective equipment such as face shields (46.9%), and safety containers for sharps and a separated space for the disposal of infectious waste (10.1%). Likewise, the following activities were found to be inadequately incorporated into the workflow of EMPs: education about infection control (77.5%), post-exposure management (35.9%), and the decontamination of items and spaces after use (88.4%). ICP were found to have a significant effect on the resources and activities of IPCPs (p\u003C0.001). The resources and activities of IPCPs were found to be significantly different among the five cities (p\u003C0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IPCPs for EMPs showed some limitations in their resources and activities. IPCPs should be actively supported, and specific IPCP activities for EMPs should be developed.","publish_time":"2015-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oh, Hyang Soon; Uhm, Dong Choon","journal":"J Prev Med Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebc7bbdf4d1954bd8575aa830977118cc1990759.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4676640.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26639747/; https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.15.058","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjszNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Republic"],"keyphrases":["activities of IPCPs","workflow of EMPs","following resources","following activities","studies of infection control","assignment of infection control personnel","hand hygiene resources","specific IPCP activities","control programs","ICP","Republic of Korea","current status of infection prevention","Emergency medical personnel","metropolitan cities","risk of exposure","transmission of infections","use of paper towels","post-exposure management","pre-hospital emergency responders","separated space","multi-response analysis","descriptive statistics","sharps","waterless antiseptics","OBJECTIVES","weaknesses","education","disposal of infectious waste","limitations","safety containers","chi-square test","personal protective equipment","significant effect","participants","mean age","shields","study","decontamination of items","spaces","structured questionnaire","regard","METHODS","cross-sectional survey","RESULTS","data","total","CONCLUSIONS","years","goal"],"language":"en"},

In phase I clinical trials several plant-derived vaccine antigens have been found to be safe and induce sufficiently high immune response. Thus, transgenic plants, including edible plant parts are suggested as excellent alternatives for the production of vaccines and economic scale-up through cultivation. Improved understanding of plant molecular biology and consequent refinement in the genetic engineering techniques have led to designing approaches for high level expression of vaccine antigens in plants. During the last decade, several efficient plant-based expression systems have been examined and more than 100 recombinant proteins including plant-derived vaccine antigens have been expressed in different plant tissues. Estimates suggest that it may become possible to obtain antigen sufficient for vaccinating millions of individuals from one acre crop by expressing the antigen in seeds of an edible legume, like peanut or soybean. In the near future, a plethora of protein products, developed through \u2018naturalized bioreactors\u2019 may reach market. Efforts for further improvements in these technologies need to be directed mainly towards validation and applicability of plant-based standardized mucosal and edible vaccines, regulatory pharmacology, formulations and the development of commercially viable GLP protocols.

Further issues remain to be clarified, including whether the genotype of rabbit HEV differs from human and swine HEV genotype 3 and whether rabbit HEV can infect human and other animals. HEV was found in farmed rabbits in several geographic areas of China, in USA and more recently in France. The prevalence of antibodies against HEV was 36%, 57% and 55% in rabbits from Virginia (USA), Gansu Province and Beijing (China), respectively. HEV RNA was detected in 16.5% of serum samples from farmed rabbits in Virginia, 7.5% in Gansu Province and 7.0% in Beijing. HEV RNA was detected in 7% of bile samples from farmed rabbits and in 23% of liver samples from wild rabbits in France. The full-length genomic sequences analysis indicates that all the rabbit strains belong to the same clade. Nucleotide sequences were 72.2\u201378.2% identical to HEV genotypes 1\u20134. Comparison with HEV sequences of human strains circulating in France and reference sequences identified a human strain closely related to rabbit HEV. A 93-nucleotide insertion in the X domain of the ORF1 of the human strain and in all the rabbit HEV strains was found. Moreover, the ability of rabbit HEV to cause cross-species infection in a pig model has recently been demonstrated. Rabbit HEV can replicate efficiently in human cell lines.

A lack of clinically germane research has led to equivocal, and occasionally conflicting, healthcare respiratory protection recommendations from public health organizations, professional societies, and experts. METHODS: The Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Clinical Trial (ResPECT) is a prospective comparison of respiratory protective equipment to be conducted at multiple U.S. study sites. Healthcare personnel who work in outpatient settings will be cluster-randomized to wear N95 respirators or medical masks for protection against infections during respiratory virus season. Outcome measures will include laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections, acute respiratory illness, and influenza-like illness. Participant exposures to patients, coworkers, and others with symptoms and signs of respiratory infection, both within and beyond the workplace, will be recorded in daily diaries. Adherence to study protocols will be monitored by the study team. DISCUSSION: ResPECT is designed to better understand the extent to which N95s and MMs reduce clinical illness among healthcare personnel. A fully successful study would produce clinically relevant results that help clinician-leaders make reasoned decisions about protection of healthcare personnel against occupationally acquired respiratory infections and prevention of spread within healthcare systems.

In this report we have studied the interaction of dengue viruses produced in insect cells, tumor cell lines, and primary human dendritic cells (DCs) with DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. Virus produced in primary DCs is unable to interact with DC-SIGN but remains infectious for L-SIGN\u2013expressing cells. Skin-resident DCs may thus be a site of initial infection by insect-produced virus, but DCs will likely not participate in large-scale virus replication during dengue infection.

We retrospectively studied whether the admission serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels can serve as a predictor of illness severity. METHODS: Included were all consecutive adult patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) between May-December, 2009 with a flu-like illness, a confirmed diagnosis of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection and a serum CRP level measured within 24 hours of presentation. Patients with a proven additional concurrent acute illness (e.g., bacteremia) were excluded. We used the ROC curve analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazard model to evaluate the predictive ability of CRP as a prognostic factor. RESULTS: Seventeen (9%) of the 191 enrolled patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), of whom eight (4%) required mechanical ventilation and three (2%) died. The median admission serum CRP levels were significantly higher among patients who required subsequent ICU care and mechanical ventilation than among patients who did not (123 mg/L and 112 mg/L vs. 40 mg/L, p \u003C .001 and 43 mg/L, p = .017, respectively). A Cox proportional hazard model identified admission serum CRP levels and auscultatory findings over the lungs as independent prognostic factors for ICU admission. Admission serum CRP levels were the only independent prognostic factor for mechanical ventilation. Thirty days after presenting to the ED, none of the patients with admission serum CRP level \u003C28 mg/L (lower tertile) required either ICU admission or mechanical ventilation. At the same time point, 19% of the patients with admission serum CRP level \u226570 mg/L (upper tertile) needed to be admitted to the ICU and 8% of the same upper tertile group required mechanical ventilation. The differences in the rates between the lower vs. upper tertile groups were significant (Log-Rank p \u003C .001 for ICU and p \u003C .024 for mechanical ventilation). CONCLUSIONS: In our study group, serum CRP levels obtained in the early ED admission stage from patients presenting with pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection were found to serve as a useful gauge for predicting disease course and assisting in patient management.","publish_time":"2010-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zimmerman, Ofer; Rogowski, Ori; Aviram, Galit; Mizrahi, Michal; Zeltser, David; Justo, Dan; Dahan, Esther; Arad, Roy; Touvia, Oholi; Tau, Luba; Tarabeia, Jalal; Berliner, Shlomo; Paran, Yael","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/611159c87e69ac113f1652442897b3cf96878939.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2959060.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20920320/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ICU admission","median admission serum CRP levels","mechanical ventilation","enrolled patients","admission serum C-reactive protein","predictive ability of CRP","consecutive adult patients","early ED admission stage","pandemic H1N1 influenza","infection","subsequent ICU care","lower tertile","upper tertile groups","Cox proportional hazard model","independent prognostic factors","confirmed diagnosis of pandemic influenza","Log-Rank p","predictor of illness severity","disease course","study group","complicated course","proven additional concurrent acute illness","intensive care unit","Kaplan-Meier curves","auscultatory findings","lungs","ROC curve analysis","rates","emergency department","useful gauge","patient management","bacteremia","hours of presentation","Data","METHODS","differences","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","time point","days","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The present study was conducted to better understand the effects of GB on immune responses in a mouse model, and to demonstrate the clearance effects of this mineral against Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in experimentally infected pigs as an initial step towards the development of a feed supplement that would promote immune activity and help prevent diseases. In the mouse model, dietary supplementation with GB enhanced concanavalin A (ConA)-induced lymphocyte proliferation and increased the percentage of CD3\u002BCD8\u002B T lymphocytes. In pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV, viral titers in lungs and lymphoid tissues from the GB-fed group were significantly decreased compared to those of the control group 12 days post-infection. Corresponding histopathological analyses demonstrated that GB-fed pigs displayed less severe pathological changes associated with PRRSV infection compared to the control group, indicating that GB promotes PRRSV clearance. These antiviral effects in pigs may be related to the ability of GB to increase CD3\u002BCD8\u002B T lymphocyte production observed in the mice. Hence, this mineral may be an effective feed supplement for increasing immune activity and preventing disease.","publish_time":"2013-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Bock-Gie; Lee, Jin-A; Lee, Bong-Joo","journal":"J Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72bf8d8fff5a84e84e219df26f0d4cbdfa0bb15c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3694184.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23814470/; https://doi.org/10.4142/jvs.2013.14.2.135","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of GB","ability of GB","PRRSV infection","GB enhanced concanavalin","PRRSV clearance","infected pigs","immune activity","control group","clearance effects","immune responses","aluminosilicate mineral","CD8","mouse model","antiviral effects","effective feed supplement","T lymphocyte production","percentage of CD3","T lymphocytes","ppm germanium","Germanium biotite","induced lymphocyte proliferation","days post-infection","respiratory syndrome virus","ConA","lungs","dietary supplementation","viral titers","lymphoid tissues","severe pathological changes","initial step","development","Corresponding histopathological analyses","mice","help","diseases","present study"],"language":"en"},

Many viruses utilize RNA helicases in their life cycle, while human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) does not encode an RNA helicase.

However, it remains unclear whether distinct DDX RNA helicases cross-talk and cooperate to modulate the HIV-1 Rev function. In this study, we noticed that distinct DDX RNA helicases, including DDX1, DDX3, DDX5, DDX17, DDX21, DDX56, except DDX6, bound to the Rev protein and they colocalized with Rev in nucleolus or nucleus. In this context, these DEAD-box RNA helicases except DDX6 markedly enhanced the HIV-1 Rev-dependent RNA export. Furthermore, DDX3 interacted with DDX5 and synergistically enhanced the Rev function. As well, combination of other distinct DDX RNA helicases cooperated to stimulate the Rev function.

In general surgery, locoregional anaesthesia was applied to laparoscopic procedures, increasing minimally invasive surgery advantages. Aims To assess and compare postoperative pain after laparoscopic adnexal procedures for benign conditions under spinal anaesthesia (SA) versus general anaesthesia (GA). Furthermore, anaesthesiologic, surgical and clinical data were evaluated in both groups. Materials and Methods This is a prospective cohort study performed in a tertiary level referral centre for minimally invasive gynaecological surgery (Gynaecology and Human Reproduction Physiopathology, University of Bologna). Women scheduled for adnexal laparoscopic surgery for benign conditions between February and May 2019 were assigned to receive either SA or GA with endotracheal intubation. A sample size of 13 women per group was needed to detect a 2-point difference in pain scores. Main findings 13 women were enrolled in the SA arm, 15 in the GA arm. In the SA cohort, the most common intraoperative adverse event was shoulder pain, reported by 3/12 women. At 1, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours after surgery pain was significantly lower in the SA arm (p \u003C .05). Patients submitted to SA experienced no need for opioid drugs administration, unlike those receiving GA. Patients\u2019 mobilization and return of bowel function were noted significantly earlier in the SA group (p \u003C .05). Conclusions SA is a feasible, safe and effective anaesthesiologic technique for laparoscopic gynaecological procedures for benign conditions, allowing a better control of postoperative pain. Women undergoing SA achieve earlier mobilization and bowel canalization. During the Covid-19 pandemics, SA could be useful in reducing the need for invasive procedures on respiratory tract.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raimondo, Diego; Borghese, Giulia; Mastronardi, Manuela; Mabrouk, Mohamed; Salucci, Paolo; Lambertini, Agnese; Casadio, Paolo; Tonini, Claudia; Meriggiola, Maria Cristina; Arena, Alessandro; Tarozzi, Giulia; Seracchioli, Renato","journal":"Journal of gynecology obstetrics and human reproduction","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ded85c49b5065d7bb33df1f3a22ec60a991f4518.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426576/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468784720301574; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogoh.2020.101813; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468784720301574?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Conclusions SA"],"locations":["SA"],"keyphrases":["SA arm","SA cohort","SA group","surgery pain","Conclusions SA","Women","laparoscopic procedures","general surgery","adnexal laparoscopic surgery","laparoscopic gynaecological procedures","invasive gynaecological surgery","laparoscopic adnexal procedures","invasive procedures","general anaesthesia","invasive surgery advantages","Abstract Background Laparoscopic gynaecological surgery","benign conditions","pain scores","GA arm","spinal anaesthesia","locoregional anaesthesia","better control of postoperative pain","need","earlier mobilization","endotracheal intubation","Patients\u2019 mobilization","bowel canalization","bowel function","effective anaesthesiologic technique","prospective cohort study","Human Reproduction Physiopathology","Gynaecology","tertiary level referral centre","common intraoperative adverse event","University of Bologna","clinical data","Methods","opioid drugs administration","respiratory tract","pandemics","sample size","hours","groups","Materials","Main findings","difference","Covid"],"language":"en"},

Biol Direct 2010, 5: 10). S is a quantity defined as S = a(2 )\u002B c(2 )\u002B g(2 )\u002B t(2), where a, c, g and t denote corresponding base frequencies. The Z-curve is a three dimensional curve that represents a DNA sequence in the manner that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other. Elhaik et al. made 4 major claims. 1) In the previous mapping system with the regular tetrahedron, calculation of the radius of the inscribed sphere is \u0022a mathematical error\u0022. 2) S follows an exponential distribution and is narrowly distributed with a range of (0.25 - 0.33). 3) Based on the Chargaff\u0027s second parity rule (PR2), \u0022S is equivalent to H [Shannon entropy]\u0022 and they are derivable from each other. 4) Z-curve \u0022suffers from over dimensionality\u0022, because based on the analysis of 235 bacterial genomes, x and y components contributed only less than 1% of the variance and therefore \u0022would be of little use\u0022. RESULTS: 1) Elhaik et al. mistakenly neglected the parameter [Formula: see text] when calculating the radius of the inscribed sphere. 2) The exponential distribution of S is a restatement of our previous conclusion, and the range of (0.25 - 0.33) only paraphrases the previously suggested S range (0.25 -1/3). 3) Elhaik et al. incorrectly disregard deviations from PR2 by treating the deviations as 0 altogether, reduce S and H, both having 4 variables, a, c, g and t, into functions of one single variable, a only, and apply this treatment to all DNA sequences as the basis of their \u0022demonstration\u0022, which is therefore invalid. 4) Elhaik et al. confuse numeral smallness with biological insignificance, and disregard the distributions of purine/pyrimidine and amino/keto bases (x and y components), the variations of which, although can be less than that of GC content, contain rich information that is important and useful, such as in locating replication origins of bacterial and archaeal genomes, and in studies of gene recognition in various species. CONCLUSION: Elhaik et al. confuse S (a single number) with Z-curve (a series of 3D coordinates), which are distinct. To use S as a case study of Z-curve, by itself, is invalid. S and H are neither equivalent nor derivable from each other. The criticisms of Elhaik, Graur and Josic are wrong.

There was no marked difference in viral trafficking between them during the entry events. Both PEDV were observed in the endosomes with or without protease at 1 h after virus inoculation. With protease, viral signals in the endosomes disappeared after 4 h, and newly synthesized viral proteins were detected in the ER after 6 h. However, without protease, viruses remained in the endosomes up to 24 h, which correlated with limited virus replication. Inhibitors of cathepsins, endogenous proteases, significantly reduced the replication of both PEDV by interfering with the viral endosomal escape.","publish_time":"2019-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oh, Changin; Kim, Yunjeong; Chang, Kyeong-Ok","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/291e09f2ad48ce12639a472097b39fbd5ceb50cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6739164.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197730; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170219304812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31445102/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170219304812","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV KD","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV KD","PEDV AA","efficient replication","viral trafficking","viral endosomal escape","limited virus replication","viral signals","endosomes","different exogenous protease","roles of proteases","endogenous proteases","adapted US PEDV strains","synthesized viral proteins","virus inoculation","important roles","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","entry events","cells","trypsin","elastase","marked difference","Inhibitors of cathepsins","viruses"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of human herpes viruses (HHVs) and other respiratory viruses in CAP not caused by typical bacterial infection and to determine their prevalence and clinical significance. METHODS: Induced sputum (IS) samples were collected from 354 hospitalised patients (infants, n = 205; children, n = 149) with respiratory illness (CAP or non-CAP) admitted to Wenling Hospital of China. We tested for HHVs and respiratory viruses using PCR-based assays. The epidemiological profiles were also analysed. RESULTS: High rate of virus detection (more than 98%) and co-infection (more than 80%) were found among IS samples from 354 hospitalised infants and children with respiratory illness in this study. Of 273 CAP samples tested, CMV (91.6%), HHV-6 (50.9%), RSV (37.4%), EBV (35.5%), HBoV (28.2%), HHV-7 (18.3%) and rhinovirus (17.2%) were the most commonly detected viruses. Of 81 non- CAP samples tested, CMV (63%), RSV (49.4%), HHV-6 (42%), EBV (24.7%), HHV-7 (13.6%) and HBoV (8.6%) were the dominant viruses detected. The prevalence of several viral agents (rhinovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus and CMV) among IS samples of CAP were significantly higher than that of non-CAP control group. We also found the prevalence of RSV coinfection with HHVs was also higher among CAP group than that of non-CAP control. CONCLUSIONS: With sensitive molecular detection techniques and IS samples, high rates of viral identification were achieved in infants and young children with respiratory illness in a rural area of China. The clinical significance of rhinovirus, bocavirus, adenovirus and HHV (especially CMV) infections should receive greater attention in future treatment and prevention studies of CAP in infants and children.","publish_time":"2013-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Weimin; Lin, Feng; Teng, Lingfang; Li, Hua; Hou, Jianyi; Tong, Rui; Zheng, Changhua; Lou, Yongliang; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a54a1fdb5e1476e36b632b0fb061da5b3b69b5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3832587.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0079477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24260230/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsxODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","RSV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["samples of CAP","non- CAP samples","CAP group","respiratory viruses","non-CAP control group","prevention studies of CAP","respiratory illness","CMV","detected viruses","hospitalised infants","young children","dominant viruses","HHVs","clinical significance of rhinovirus","prevalence of RSV coinfection","roles of human herpes viruses","bocavirus","adenovirus","study","EBV","HBoV","rural area of China","Wenling Hospital of China","high rates of viral identification","High rate of virus detection","comprehensive studies","viral agents","hospitalised patients","co-infection","typical bacterial infection","sensitive molecular detection techniques","greater attention","future treatment","infections","pneumonia","community","PCR-based assays","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","Induced sputum","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","epidemiological profiles","aim"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: Human bocavirus (HBoV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are two important viruses for children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). We aimed to assay the correlation between viral load and clinical characteristics of HBoV and HMPV with LRTI in Changsha, China. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from children with LRTI were collected. Real\u2010time PCR was used to screen HBoV and HMPV. Analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 software. RESULTS: Pneumonia was the most frequent diagnosis. There was no significant difference between HBoV\u2010 and HMPV\u2010positive patients in age (P = .506) or hospitalization duration (P = .280); 24.1% and 18.2% were positive for HBoV and HMPV. HBoV infections peaked in summer (32.2%), and HMPV infections peaked in winter (28.9%). The HBoV\u2010positive patients had a shorter hospitalization duration than the HBoV\u2010negative patients (P = .021), and the HMPV\u2010positive patients had a higher prevalence of fever than the HMPV\u2010negative patients (P = .002). The HBoV viral load was significantly higher among patients aged \u003C1 year (P = .006). The mean HBoV and HMPV viral loads were not significantly different between patients with single infections and coinfections. Patients infected with HBoV only were older than those coinfected with HBoV and other respiratory viruses (P = .005). No significant difference was found in the clinical characteristics of patients infected with HMPV only and those coinfected with HMPV and other respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION: Pneumonia was the most frequent diagnosis caused by HBoV and HMPV. Neither HBoV nor HMPV viral load was correlated with disease severity.","publish_time":"2018-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Jie\u2010ying; Peng, Ying; Peng, Xiao\u2010you; Gao, Han\u2010chun; Sun, Ya\u2010ping; Xie, Le\u2010yun; Zhong, Li\u2010li; Duan, Zhao\u2010jun; Xie, Zhi\u2010ping; Cao, You\u2010de","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1431d7d5f795acaa4781ae85a6b7c6d51cb54ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5820417.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29266860/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12535","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjsyMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia"],"organizations":["HMPV","LRTI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HBoV infections","HMPV infections","mean HBoV","HBoV viral load","clinical characteristics of HBoV","positive patients","HMPV viral loads","negative patients","clinical characteristics of patients","respiratory viruses","children","lower respiratory tract infections","single infections","clinical characteristics of LRTIs","Lower respiratory tract illness","important viruses","frequent diagnosis","Pneumonia","significant difference","China","shorter hospitalization duration","Human bocavirus","human metapneumovirus","higher prevalence of fever","major cause of morbidity","NPAs","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","mortality","BACKGROUND","information","correlation","Changsha","age","disease severity","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","coinfections","year","Analyses","SPSS","software","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","Real\u2010time PCR","winter","summer"],"language":"en"},

Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out using post inoculated allontoic fluid to amplify the spike (S) glycoprotein of S1 subunit of IBV. All the eggs inoculated with five pooled tissue samples and vaccine sample showed dwarfing and curling of SPF embryos indicative of IBV. All the five samples and the vaccine sample produced the expected amplicons of 466 bp by RT-PCR. The sequencing of five isolates revealed that all the five sequences were 99.09\u2013100 % similar among themselves and showed 99.10\u2013100 % nucleotide identity with the vaccine strain. On multiple sequence alignment it was found that our isolates were more similar at S1 subunit nucleotide level with the reference Ma5 and H120 vaccine strains than the reference Mass41 strain. The sequences of Anand isolates revealed further genetic changes in the circulating IBV in comparison to previous isolate of Gujarat as well as higher differences with the strains isolated in other states showing substantial changes at genetic level in Indian IBV isolates, which may partially explain the increasing incidences of IB in the country in spite of the vaccination.

Presently, the World Health Organization indicates that the fatality rate due to COVID-19 is about 2%, inferring that many positive subjects may potentially overcome the illness with mild influenza-like symptoms and no need for hospitalization at intensive-care units. Because COVID-19 is completely new to the human immune system, many throughout the world are likely vulnerable to becoming sick after their initial exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Besides hospitalized cases, many individuals are likely asymptomatic but potentially carry the virus. While our knowledge about carriers and their virus shedding is deficient, some studies modelling the viral transmission have considered the potential contribution of the asymptomatic carriers. Protocols for managing asymptomatic cases, for example for controlling them to restrict their contact with healthy people at public places or private residences, have not been established. In-house quarantine may as well be applicable to asymptomatic cases if they could be identified and diagnosed. Presumably now, the asymptomatic subjects potentially contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 without their knowledge, intention, or being diagnosed as carriers.

Abstract Acute diarrheas are a common disease, and their high frequency constitutes an important problem in terms of public health. Most of the time, they have an infectious origin and spontaneous complete recovery is achieved within less than three days. In practice, history of diarrhea, physical examination and environmental identification are the main points for selecting patients who will need medical explorations. Only 1% of patients need immediate laboratory complementary investigations, i.e., stool analysis, either because their symptomatology indicates potential underlying acute colitis (bloody stools, localized abdominal pain), or when there is an underlying frail condition associated with an immediate risk for the patient, or in case of a particular context such a stay in a tropical area. The practitioner has to inform the biologist on all symptoms and relevant information so as to optimize the analysis and its cost-effectiveness. Until the laboratory results are available, such selected patients require antibiotic treatment (quinolones). These investigations are also needed in case of \u003E3-day persistent diarrhea. When stool samples are free of bacteria or parasite, and when acute diarrhea persists more than 5 days, a specialist should be visited. Thus, only a small proportion of patients with acute diarrhea will undergo endoscopy, probably cases of colitis or recto colitis. Early re-hydration remains the preferential treatment of acute diarrhea in children since, for more than two decades, it has demonstrated its efficacy in reducing mortality, particularly in developing countries.","publish_time":"2004-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carr\u00E9, D.","journal":"EMC - Chirurgie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0d89ac2562301f9977530839819c3bc8f9d4e35.json; document_parses/pdf_json/67cf8c36e3426e07718b61f8203f2a364adddb65.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1762570X04000349; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1762570X04000349","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["l\u0027enfant"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the patient","stay in","the time","The practitioner","In practice","acute diarrhea in children since","examens de selles","the main points","when acute diarrhea persists more than","to inform the biologist","Until the laboratory results","also needed in case","jours","patients with acute diarrhea will undergo endoscopy","particularly in developing countries","colitis or recto colitis","hydration remains the preferential treatment","selles sanglantes","demonstrated its efficacy in reducing mortality","Abstract Acute diarrheas","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements de selles n\u00E9gatifs","information so as to optimize the analysis","their high frequency constitutes an important problem in terms","patients need immediate laboratory complementary investigations","an infectious origin","when there is an underlying frail condition associated with an immediate risk","stool analysis","selecting patients who will need medical explorations","When stool samples","fait","diarrh\u00E9es aigu\u00EBs va","bacteria or parasite","Only","explorations compl\u00E9mentaires","r\u00E9sultats des examens","either because their symptomatology indicates potential underlying acute colitis","such selected patients require antibiotic treatment","more than two decades","its cost","small proportion","petite proportion","These investigations","colite aigu\u00EB","rentabilit\u00E9 des pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements","spontaneous complete recovery is achieved within less than three days","particular context such","probably cases","available","symptoms","common disease","environmental identification","they","physical examination","stools","probl\u00E8me de sant\u00E9 publique","localized abdominal pain","douleurs abdominales circonscrites","Early re","public health","fluoroquinolones","history","specialist should be visited","r\u00E9hydratation pr\u00E9coce","avis sp\u00E9cialis\u00E9","tropical area","pr\u00E9sentation clinique","contexte particulier","malade","effectiveness","cas s\u00E9lectionn\u00E9s","risque imm\u00E9diat","terrain fragile","grande fr\u00E9quence","pays","\u00E9chelle","efficacit\u00E9","actualit\u00E9","antibioth\u00E9rapie empirique bas\u00E9e","s\u00E9jour","tropiques","enfant","plan th\u00E9rapeutique","biologiste","Thus","Most","endoscopie","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","seule","termes de mortalit\u00E9","\u00E9volution","voie de d\u00E9veloppement","d\u00E9cennies","population","origine","rectocolite","\u00E9pisode"],"language":"fr"},

OBJECTIVE: We characterized fluctuations in nasal aspirate cytokines during naturally-occurring respiratory viral infections in children with asthma. METHODS: Sixteen children underwent home collections of nasal aspirates when they were without cold symptoms and again during self-reported respiratory illnesses. The presence of viral infection was ascertained by multiplex PCR. Cytokines were measured by multiplex immune assay. mRNA expression for selected markers of viral infection was measured by RT-PCR. A cumulative respiratory symptom score was calculated for each day of measurement. Generalized estimated equations were used to evaluate associations between viral infection and marker elevation, and between marker elevation and symptom score. RESULTS: The 16 patients completed a total of 37 weeks of assessment (15 \u201Cwell\u201D weeks; 22 self-assessed \u201Csick\u201D weeks). Viral infections were detected in three of the \u201Cwell\u201D weeks and 17 of the \u201Csick\u201D weeks (10 rhinovirus, 3 coronavirus, 2 influenza A, 2 influenza B, 2 respiratory syncytial virus, 1 parainfluenza). Compared to virus-negative well weeks, nasal aspirate IFN-\u03B3, CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL5/RANTES, CCL11/eotaxin-1, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL4/MIP-1\u03B2, CCL7/MCP-3 and CCL20/MIP3\u03B1 protein levels increased during virus-positive sick weeks. Only a subset of cytokines (IFN-\u03B3, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5 and CCL20) correlated with self-reported respiratory tract symptoms. While many aspirates were dilute and showed no mRNA signal, viral infection significantly increased the number of samples that were positive for IFN-\u03BB1, IFN-\u03BB2/3, TLR3, RIG-I and IRF7 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS \u0026 CLINICAL RELEVANCE: We conclude that, in children with asthma, naturally-occurring viral infections apparently induce a robust innate immune response including expression of specific chemokines, IFNs and IFN-responsive genes.","publish_time":"2012-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lewis, Toby C.; Henderson, Tiffany A.; Carpenter, Ashley R.; Ramirez, Ixsy A.; McHenry, Christina L.; Goldsmith, Adam M.; Ren, Xiaodan; Mentz, Graciela B.; Mukherjee, Bhramar; Robins, Thomas G.; Joiner, Terence A.; Mohammad, Layla S.; Nguyen, Emily R.; Burns, Mark A.; Burke, David T.; Hershenson, Marc B.","journal":"Clinical \u0026 Experimental Allergy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be902d89e87bf2337dc2ff1df92a8c05cdfedb96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4219353.xml.json","url":"https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/94448/1/cea12005.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1111/cea.12005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23181789/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjszNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CONCLUSIONS \u0026 CLINICAL RELEVANCE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viral infections","presence of viral infection","weeks of assessment","virus-positive sick weeks","selected markers of viral infection","nasal aspirate IFN-\u03B3","IFN-\u03BB2","IFN-\u03BB1","respiratory syncytial virus","children","self-reported respiratory illnesses","nasal aspirate cytokines","self-reported respiratory tract symptoms","mRNA expression","cumulative respiratory symptom score","IFN-responsive genes","CXCL8","CCL20","marker elevation","CCL5","virus-negative","CCL4","asthma exacerbations","MCP","subset of cytokines","IRF7 mRNA","mRNA signal","multiplex PCR","home collections of nasal aspirates","influenza B","cold symptoms","immune assay","RT-PCR","expression of specific chemokines","robust innate immune response","IFNs","associations","MIP3\u03B1 protein levels","viruses","eotaxin","RANTES","mechanisms","RIG","CCL7","CCL11","CXCL10","TLR3","fluctuations","rhinovirus","number of samples","METHODS","patients","total","coronavirus","parainfluenza","CONCLUSIONS","CLINICAL RELEVANCE","estimated equations","BACKGROUND","day of measurement","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A self-administered paper-based questionnaire was used to collect the data. The questionnaire collected information about sociodemographic and practice-related characteristics of physicians and included items to assess their knowledge of surveillance and reporting practices. This study included 223 physicians (152 males and 71 females). About 60.1% of the residents were graduates from medical schools in Jordan and the remaining (39.9%) were graduates from medical schools in other countries. Approximately two thirds of residents (62.3%) were doing their residency in Ministry of Health hospitals and the rest (37.7%) in 2 teaching hospitals. Only 44.8% of physicians had defined surveillance correctly. Only 27.4% of physicians had been educated or trained on surveillance. About 39.5% of physicians had filled at least one report form during their practice. The main reasons for not reporting mandatory diseases were high workload (49.8%) and being not trained on reporting diseases (46.6%). A relatively high percentage of physicians have insufficient knowledge of surveillance and reporting of notifiable communicable diseases. Training of physicians on surveillance and diseases notification is highly needed.

In addition to their immune functions, microglial cells play an important role in other cerebral processes, including the regulation of synaptic architecture and neurogenesis. Chronic microglial activation is regarded as detrimental, and it is considered a pathogenic mechanism common to several neurological disorders. Microglial activation and function have been extensively studied in rodent experimental models, whereas the characterization of human cells has been limited due to the restricted availability of primary sources of human microglia. To overcome this problem, human immortalized microglial cell lines have been developed. The human microglial clone 3 cell line, HMC3, was established in 1995, through SV40-dependent immortalization of human embryonic microglial cells. It has been recently authenticated by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC\u00AE) and distributed under the name of HMC3 (ATCC\u00AECRL-3304). The HMC3 cells have been used in six research studies, two of which also indicated by ATCC\u00AE as reference articles. However, a more accurate literature revision suggests that clone 3 was initially distributed under the name of CHME3. In this regard, several studies have been published, thus contributing to a more extensive characterization of this cell line. Remarkably, the same cell line has been used in different laboratories with other denominations, i.e., CHME-5 cells and C13-NJ cells. In view of the fact that \u201Cbeing now authenticated by ATCC\u00AE\u201D may imply a wider distribution of the cells, we aimed at reviewing data obtained with the human microglia cell line clone 3, making the readers aware of this complicated nomenclature. In addition, we also included original data, generated in our laboratory with the HMC3 (ATCC\u00AECRL-3304) cells, providing information on the current state of the culture together with supplementary details on the culturing procedures to obtain and maintain viable cells.","publish_time":"2018-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dello Russo, Cinzia; Cappoli, Natalia; Coletta, Isabella; Mezzogori, Daniele; Paciello, Fabiola; Pozzoli, Giacomo; Navarra, Pierluigi; Battaglia, Alessandra","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d874577cfbe77f483ae4988cda1975f8d470c91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6131758.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200996/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-018-1288-0","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Microglia"],"organizations":["American Type Culture Collection"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HMC3 cells","characterization of human cells","viable cells","human microglial clone","ATCC","human microglia cell line clone","unique myeloid cells","C13-NJ cells","human immortalized microglial cell lines","SV40-dependent immortalization of human embryonic microglial cells","Chronic microglial activation","line of immune defense","restricted availability of primary sources of human microglia","addition","CRL","immune functions","reviewing data","original data","extensive characterization","research studies","American Type Culture Collection","important role","problem","cerebral processes","supplementary details","culturing procedures","readers aware","brain parenchyma","central nervous system","regulation of synaptic architecture","pathogenic mechanism common","neurological disorders","current state","laboratory","rodent experimental models","different laboratories","neurogenesis","denominations","complicated nomenclature","accurate literature revision","information","wider distribution","reference articles","fact","regard","CHME3"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate a multiplex molecular real-time assay for the routine diagnosis of respiratory viruses, to analyze the symptoms associated with the pathogens detected and to determine the spread of virus during the period. STUDY DESIGN: Respiratory samples were collected from children presenting with respiratory symptoms and attending the emergency unit during the 2010\u20132011 winter seasons. Samples were tested with the multiplex RespiFinder(\u00AE) 15 assay (PathoFinder\u2122) which potentially detects 15 viruses. RESULTS: 857 (88.7%) of the 966 samples collected from 914 children were positive for one (683 samples) or multiple viruses (174 samples). The most prevalent were the respiratory syncytial virus (39.5%) and the rhinovirus (24.4%). Influenza viruses were detected in 139 (14.4%) samples. Adenovirus was detected in 93 (9.6%) samples, coronaviruses in 88 (9.1%), metapneumovirus in 51 (5.3%) and parainfluenzae in 47 (4.9%). Rhinovirus (40%) was the most prevalent pathogen in upper respiratory tract infections while respiratory syncytial virus (49.9%) was the most prevalent in lower respiratory tract infections. Co-infections were associated with severe respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: The multiplex assay detected clinically important viruses in a single genomic test and thus will be useful for detecting several viruses causing respiratory tract disorders.","publish_time":"2014-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mengelle, C.; Mansuy, J.M.; Pierre, A.; Claudet, I.; Grouteau, E.; Micheau, P.; Saun\u00E9, K.; Izopet, J.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c44f1468abe1e0b66a1492ecf42cf14e78ed106.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185773.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214003230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25223920/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214003230; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.08.023","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory samples","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory tract disorders","severe respiratory symptoms","upper respiratory tract infections","lower respiratory tract infections","routine diagnosis of respiratory viruses","etiological pathogen of respiratory viral infections","multiplex assay","important viruses","multiple viruses","Influenza viruses","Co-infections","multiplex molecular real-time assay","prevalent pathogen","multiplex RespiFinder","multiplex molecular technique","spread of virus","children","rhinovirus","STUDY DESIGN","support","single genomic test","clinical signs","emergency unit","OBJECTIVES","aim","pathogens","period","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","winter seasons","PathoFinder","coronaviruses","Adenovirus","metapneumovirus","parainfluenzae","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure serum pNfH concentration in 219 MND patients consecutively enrolled in our tertiary MND clinic. A multifactorial analysis was carried out to investigate the major clinical determinants of serum pNfH. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis were performed to explore the prognostic value of serum pNfH. Serum pNfH levels were not homogenous among MND phenotypes; higher concentrations in pyramidal, bulbar, and classic phenotypes were observed. C9orf72-MND exhibited higher pNfH concentrations compared to non-C9orf72 MND. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed mean MEP/cMAP and disease progression rate as the two major predictors of serum pNfH levels (R(2) = 0.188; p \u2264 0.001). Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showed a significant difference of survival among MND subgroups when divided into quartiles based on pNfH concentrations, log-rank X(2) = 53.0, p \u2264 0.0001. Our study evidenced that higher serum pNfH concentration is a negative independent prognostic factor for survival. In Cox multivariate model, pNfH concentration showed the highest hazard ratio compared to the other factors influencing survival included in the analysis. pNfH differs among the MND phenotypes and is an independent prognostic factor for survival. This study provides supporting evidence of the role of pNfH as useful prognostic biomarker for MND patients. Neurofilament measurements should be considered in the future prognostic models and in clinical trials for biomarker-based stratification, and to evaluate treatment response.

Historically, angiotensin II (Ang II) was thought to be the primary effector peptide of this system. Ang II is produced predominantly by the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) on angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang II acts mainly through the angiotensin II type\u20101 receptor (AT(1)) and, together with ACE, these components represent the \u2018classical\u2019 axis of the RAS. Drug therapies targeting the RAS by inhibiting Ang II formation (ACE inhibitors) or binding to its receptor (angiotensin receptor blockers) are now in widespread clinical use and have been shown to reduce tissue injury and fibrosis in cardiac and renal disease independently of their effects on blood pressure. In 2000, two groups using different methodologies identified a homolog of ACE, called ACE2, which cleaves Ang II to form the biologically active heptapeptide, Ang\u2010(1\u20137). Conceptually, ACE2, Ang\u2010(1\u20137), and its putative receptor, the mas receptor represent an \u2018alternative\u2019 axis of the RAS capable of opposing the often deleterious actions of Ang II. Interestingly, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers increase Ang\u2010(1\u20137) production and it has been proposed that some of the beneficial effects of these drugs are mediated through upregulation of Ang\u2010(1\u20137) rather than inhibition of Ang II production or receptor binding. The present review focuses on the novel components and pathways of the RAS with particular reference to their potential contribution towards the pathophysiology of liver disease.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lubel, John S; Herath, Chandana B; Burrell, Louise M; Angus, Peter W","journal":"J Gastroenterol Hepatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/caa320aa48df451c4f7f3fc92dc0ec376c0afd8b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166336.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1746.2008.05461.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18557800/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang II"],"organizations":["RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibition of Ang","upregulation of Ang","angiotensin receptor blockers","deleterious actions of Ang","receptor binding","angiotensin system","mas receptor","putative receptor","effect of angiotensin","ACE inhibitors","RAS capable","homolog of ACE","tissue injury","axis","production","ACE2","renal disease","novel components","beneficial effects","pathophysiology of liver disease","sodium","water homeostasis","potential contribution","key regulator of vascular resistance","response","particular reference","fibrosis","pathways","formation","different methodologies","drugs","enzyme","groups","primary effector peptide","present review","widespread clinical use","type","acts","renin","blood pressure","Drug therapies","active heptapeptide"],"language":"en"},

It is possible that public pensions buffer access to healthcare in older persons during times of economic crisis, but to our knowledge, this has not been tested empirically in Europe. METHODS: We integrated panel data on 16 European countries for years 2004\u20132010 with indicators of public pension, unemployment insurance and sickness insurance entitlement from the Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset and unmet need (due to cost) prevalence rates from EuroStat 2014 edition. Using country-level fixed-effects regression models, we evaluate whether greater public pension entitlement, which helps reduce old-age poverty, reduces the prevalence of unmet medical need in older persons and whether it reduces inequalities in unmet medical need across the income distribution. RESULTS: We found that each 1-unit increase in public pension entitlement is associated with a 1.11 percentage-point decline in unmet medical need due to cost among over 65s (95% CI \u22120.55 to \u22121.66). This association is strongest for the lowest income quintile (1.65 percentage points, 95% CI \u22121.19 to \u22122.10). Importantly, we found consistent evidence that out-of-pocket payments were linked with greater unmet needs, but that this association was mitigated by greater public pension entitlement (\u03B2=\u22121.21 percentage points, 95% CI \u22120.37 to \u22122.06). CONCLUSIONS: Greater public pension entitlement plays a crucial role in reducing inequalities in unmet medical need among older persons, especially in healthcare systems which rely heavily on out-of-pocket payments.","publish_time":"2016-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reeves, Aaron; McKee, Martin; Mackenbach, Johan; Whitehead, Margaret; Stuckler, David","journal":"J Epidemiol Community Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efdc5d569bff1bbf7b2233e6b3a84a0c61a10d17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5284463.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2015-206257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965315/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of unmet medical need","greater public pension entitlement","greater unmet needs","older persons","indicators of public pension","medical care","sickness insurance entitlement","percentage points","public pensions buffer access","inequalities","cost","out-of-pocket payments","association","unemployment insurance","healthcare systems","prevalence rates","income distribution","lowest income quintile","Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset","crucial role","country-level fixed-effects regression models","times of economic crisis","Great Recession","panel data","European countries","years","onset","EuroStat","unit increase","decline","CONCLUSIONS","old-age poverty","edition","consistent evidence","METHODS","knowledge","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics, treatment and outcome of children diagnosed with community-acquired MP pneumonia (CAMP) in a tertiary hospital in Valencia, Spain. Material and methods Medical records of children \u003C14 years with CAMP were retrospectively reviewed from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients with radiological evidence of pneumonia and microbiological confirmation of MP (PCR from nasopharyngeal swab and/or serum specific IgM) were considered CAMP. Results One hundred and sixty two children were diagnosed with CAMP; median age 6 years (IQR: 4\u20139). The positive MP test rate among children with CAP progressively increased with age as did the empirical use of macrolides. There were two peaks of cases in 2011 and in 2015, being July, August, November and December the seasons with the higher number of cases. The most frequent radiological pattern was segmental infiltrate (62.3%) and 22 (13.6%) children had pleural effusion. It was noteworthy the mild symptomatology and low levels of inflammatory parameters that children with CAMP had. A macrolide was empirically initiated in 68.5% of cases. Hospital admission rate was inversely proportional to patient\u0027s age. Conclusions According to this study, older, less symptomatic patients and with lower inflammatory parameters had the greatest rate of MP infection among children with CAP and thus they could benefit of empiric macrolide therapy. Therefore, knowing the epidemiology of a geographical area may be important for the management of CAP in children.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aguilera-Alonso, David; L\u00F3pez Ruiz, Roc\u00EDo; Centeno Rubiano, Jose; Morell Garc\u00EDa, Marta; Valero Garc\u00EDa, Isabel; Ocete Moch\u00F3n, Mar\u00EDa Dolores; Montesinos Sanchis, Elena","journal":"Anales de Pediatr\u00EDa (English Edition)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92196a70fce15dd68413ea1f03e9c14b9bc9ef59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146767.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289046/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2341287919300262; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2341287919300262; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpede.2019.01.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Valencia","Spain"],"keyphrases":["outcome of children","CAMP","MP pneumonia","methods Medical records of children","greatest rate of MP infection","positive MP test rate","management of CAP","microbiological confirmation of MP","radiological evidence of pneumonia","Hospital admission rate","median age","years","patient\u0027s age","peaks of cases","lower inflammatory parameters","higher number of cases","low levels of inflammatory parameters","symptomatic patients","tertiary hospital","frequent radiological pattern","empiric macrolide therapy","common etiological agents of community","nasopharyngeal swab","mild symptomatology","objectives Mycoplasma pneumoniae","PCR","treatment","serum specific IgM","Abstract Introduction","epidemiological characteristics","segmental infiltrate","study","Material","geographical area","Valencia","Spain","seasons","IQR","empirical use of macrolides","epidemiology","Conclusions","pleural effusion","Results"],"language":"en"},

Patients were transplanted for a hematological malignancy and received either a myeloablative or a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen. Prophylaxis of GVHD consisted of cyclosporin A and mycophenolic acid. RESULTS: Acute GVHD was diagnosed at a median of 61 days post-transplantation. All patients had grade III aGVHD of the gut. Second-line treatment with etanercept was started at a median of 13 days after initiation of first-line therapy. Overall response rate was 53%, with CR in 3 patients and PR in 5 patients. Median overall survival after initiation of treatment with etanercept was 66 days (range 5\u2013267) for the entire group. Median overall survival was 99 days (range 47\u2013267 days) for responders and 17 days (range 5\u201366 days) for non-responders (p\u003C0.01). Nevertheless, all patients died. Causes of death were progressive GVHD in 7 patients (47%), infection in 6 patients (40%), cardiac death in 1 patient (6.7%) and relapse in 1 patient (6,7%). CONCLUSION: Second-line treatment with etanercept does induce responses in SR-aGVHD of the gut but appears to be associated with poor long-term survival even in responding patients.","publish_time":"2017-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Jong, Cornelis N.; Saes, Lotte; Klerk, Clara P.

Information remains limited about the comparative protein expression profiles of chicken embryonic tissues in response to IBV infection in ovo. In this study, we analyzed the changes of protein expression in trachea and kidney tissues from chicken embryos, following IBV infection in ovo, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS). RESULTS: 17 differentially expressed proteins from tracheal tissues and 19 differentially expressed proteins from kidney tissues were identified. These proteins mostly related to the cytoskeleton, binding of calcium ions, the stress response, anti-oxidative, and macromolecular metabolism. Some of these altered proteins were confirmed further at the mRNA level using real-time RT-PCR. Moreover, western blotting analysis further confirmed the changes of annexin A5 and HSPB1 during IBV infection. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, we have performed the first analysis of the proteomic changes in chicken embryonic trachea and kidney tissues during IBV infection in ovo. The data obtained should facilitate a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBV infection.","publish_time":"2011-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cao, Zhongzan; Han, Zongxi; Shao, Yuhao; Geng, Heyuan; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Proteome Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18fa3d1a5503e1943ce8e657416f9da8fe2cb475.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3060854.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-5956-9-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21385394/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["kidney tissues","pathogenesis of IBV infection","tracheal tissues","ovo","altered proteins","chicken embryonic trachea","changes of protein expression","comparative protein expression profiles of chicken embryonic tissues","chicken embryos","proteomic changes","changes of annexin A5","Avian infectious bronchitis","avian infectious coronavirus","stress response","MALDI-TOF","TOF MS","western blotting analysis","flight tandem mass spectrometry","ionization time","binding of calcium ions","HSPB1","mRNA level","better understanding","serious diseases of economic importance","chickens","real-time RT-PCR","laser desorption","cytoskeleton","BACKGROUND","two-dimensional gel electrophoresis","macromolecular metabolism","matrix","Information","best","data","CONCLUSIONS","knowledge","study","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In this multicenter study, children \u003C18 years of age hospitalized in six PICU from different hospitals due to severe RSV infection between September 2008 and March 2013 were included. A retrospective chart review was performed. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were identified. The median length of PICU stay was 6 days (range, 1\u2013154 days) and median PICU care cost was USD2,741 (range, USD556\u201398 243). Of 62 patients who were \u003C2 years old at the beginning of the RSV season, 33 (53.2%) were high\u2010risk patients for severe RSV infection. Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (22.6%) was the most common risk factor, followed by chronic lung disease (11.3%), neuromuscular disease or congenital abnormality of the airway (NMD/CAA) (11.3%), and prematurity (8.1%). The percentage of patients eligible for PZ prophylaxis ranged from 38.7% to 48.4% based on the guidelines, but only two (2.2%) received PZ \u226430 days prior to PICU admission.

Approximately, 7% of the case IDs submitted from the US were positive for PDCoV. Specimens were categorized into eight groups, and the univariate analysis indicated that oral fluids had 1.89 times higher odds of detecting PDCoV compared to feces. While the 43\u201356 day age group had the highest percentage of PDCoV positives (8.4%), the univariate analysis indicated no significant differences between age groups. However, multivariable analysis for age adjusted by specimen indicated the \u003E147 day age group had 59% lower odds than suckling pigs of being positive for PDCoV. The percentage of PDCoV in diagnostic samples decreased to \u003C1% in September 2014. In addition, 19 complete PDCoV genomes were sequenced, and Bayesian analysis was conducted to estimate the emergence of the US clade. The evolutionary rate of the PDCoV genome is estimated to be 3.8\u00D710\u22124 substitutions/site/year (2.3\u00D710\u22124\u20135.4\u00D710\u22124, 95% HPD).

Additionally, human-adapted HAs gain glycosylation sites over time, although their biological function is poorly defined. Using quantitative glycomic analysis, we show that HAs from human pandemic viruses exhibit significant proportions of high-mannose type N-linked glycans throughout the head domain. By contrast, poorly adapted avian-origin HAs contain predominately complex-type glycans, which have greater structural diversity. Although oligomannose levels vary, they are present in all tested recombinant HAs and whole viruses and can be specifically targeted for universal detection. The positions of high-mannose glycosites on the HA of human H1N1 and H3N2 strains are conserved. Additionally, high-mannose-binding lectins possess a broad capacity to neutralize and prevent infection with contemporary H3N2 strains.

The factors associated with severe diseases are not well defined, but more severe disease is more often seen among persons aged \u003E65 years, infants, pregnant women, and individuals of any age with underlying health conditions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using gene expression microarrays, the transcriptomic profiles of influenza-infected patients with severe (N = 11), moderate (N = 40) and mild (N = 83) symptoms were compared with the febrile patients of unknown etiology (N = 73). We found that influenza-infected patients, regardless of their clinical outcomes, had a stronger induction of antiviral and cytokine responses and a stronger attenuation of NK and T cell responses in comparison with those with unknown etiology. More importantly, we found that both interferon and ubiquitination signaling were strongly attenuated in patients with the most severe outcomes in comparison with those with moderate and mild outcomes, suggesting the protective roles of these pathways in disease pathogenesis. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCES: The attenuation of interferon and ubiquitination pathways may associate with the clinical outcomes of influenza patients.","publish_time":"2014-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoang, Long Truong; Tolfvenstam, Thomas; Ooi, Eng Eong; Khor, Chiea Chuen; Naim, Ahmand Nazri Mohamed; Ho, Eliza Xin Pei; Ong, Swee Hoe; Wertheim, Heiman F.; Fox, Annette; Van Vinh Nguyen, Chau; Nghiem, Ngoc My; Ha, Tuan Manh; Thi Ngoc Tran, Anh; Tambayah, Paul; Lin, Raymond; Sangsajja, Chariya; Manosuthi, Weerawat; Chuchottaworn, Chareon; Sansayunh, Piamlarp; Chotpitayasunondh, Tawee; Suntarattiwong, Piyarat; Chokephaibulkit, Kulkanya; Puthavathana, Pilaipan; de Jong, Menno D.; Farrar, Jeremy; van Doorn, H.

Early accurate diagnosis is important for infected dogs. In recent years, magnetic separation has become an efficient and useful tool for bioassays. In this study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) based on magnetic purification assay was developed for the quantitative detection of CPV-2. RESULTS: The optimum working reaction volume and reaction time for LFIA was 100 \u03BCL and 2 min, respectively. The PCR-LFIA assay only detected CPV-2, and did not show cross-detection of non-CPV strains. Experiments showed analytical sensitivity of 3 \u00D7 10(1) copies/\u03BCL and demonstrated the PCR-LFIA has a diagnostic agreement of 100% with conventional PCR on detection of clinical samples (22.6% positive, 14/62). Cutoff value is 146. The results were further verified by sequencing and BLAST software. The entire process from PCR step only takes ~ 80 min. CONCLUSIONS: This approach provides an attractive platform for rapid and quantitative detection of CPV-2, indicating great promise as a convenient molecular detection tool to facilitate disease outbreak investigations and response timely.","publish_time":"2019-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhuang, Linlin; Ji, Yongxin; Tian, Peilong; Wang, Kaixuan; Kou, Chengkun; Gu, Ning; Zhang, Yu","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cb23e4f04ec3120b42a3c5bb0d21053f9f8a8ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6337814.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654823/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1774-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ1LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1733910,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"itbYdiSL5h3C0Wvd2WGNaA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_45.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LFIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quantitative detection of CPV","PCR-LFIA assay","conventional PCR","PCR step","cross-detection","detected CPV","detection of clinical samples","non-CPV strains","convenient molecular detection tool","reaction time","\u03BCL","RESULTS","polymerase chain reaction","magnetic purification assay","optimum working reaction volume","useful tool","magnetic separation","disease outbreak investigations","attractive platform","great promise","fluorescent lateral flow immunoassay","severe gastroenteritis","Early accurate diagnosis","infected dogs","common etiological agents","diagnostic agreement","approach","study","puppies","CONCLUSIONS","response","sequencing","recent years","bioassays","BACKGROUND","Canine parvovirus","entire process","Experiments","analytical sensitivity","BLAST software","copies","Cutoff value"],"language":"en"},

We analyzed their beliefs, attitudes and intentions with regard to adoption of the H1N1 (swine flu) vaccine. We developed and tested two alternative models on the role of mass media and personal information sources on the attitude towards the disease and the intention to get vaccinated. FINDINGS: Our study finds that mass media and personal sources of information simultaneously impact perceived threat from disease (attitude) and the intention to get vaccinated during a global pandemic. Personal information sources are more effective than mass media sources in impacting both attitude and intention. While the impact of mass media weakens from the attitude stage to the intention stage, the impact of personal information sources increases from the attitude stage to the intention stage.

To test the effectiveness of this system, we applied this new approach to express simultaneously two different 21-bp hairpin siRNA duplexes that specifically attack the HBs and HBx genes of HBV, respectively, in Bel-7402 and HepG2.2.15 cells. Results indicated that dual siRNA could simultaneously inhibit the expression of HBs and HBx gene by 83.7% and 87.5%, respectively, based on luciferase assays.

Rapamycin is a bacterial product that can inhibit mTOR via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling is necessary for the development of influenza and modulates the antibody response to provide cross-protective immunity to lethal infection with influenza virus. In one human study, it was found that the treatment of severe H1N1 influenza\u2011related pneumonia with rapamycin and steroids improved the outcome. However, in other studies, immunosuppression with systemic steroids, and possibly rapamycin as well, was associated with an increased morbidity/mortality and a prolonged viral replication. In order to avoid the systemic side-effects, some investigators have postulated that the inhalation of rapamycin would be desirable. However, the inhalation of rapamycin, with its well-documented lung toxicity, could be contraindicated. Another class of drug, biguanides, can also inhibit mTOR, but have no lung toxicity. Biguanides are widely used small molecule drugs prescribed as oral anti-diabetics that have exhibited considerable promise in oncology. During the 1971 outbreak of influenza, diabetic patients treated with the biguanides, phenformin and buformin, had a lower incidence of infection than diabetics treated with sulfonylureas or insulin. Both buformin and phenformin reduce the mortality of influenza in mice; phenformin is less effective than buformin. The inhalation of buformin or phenformin for influenza may be an effective novel treatment strategy that would limit the risk of systemic side-effects associated with biguanides due to the low inhaled dose. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus closely related to the SARS virus. The disease is the cause of the 2019\u20132020 coronavirus outbreak. It is primarily spread between individuals via small droplets emitted from infected individuals when breathing or coughing. PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling responses play important roles in MERS-CoV infection and may represent a novel drug target for therapeutic intervention strategies.

However, little is known about viral etiology related to AECOPD in Asia. We aimed to study the viral etiology of AECOPD in Hong Kong. Methods Patients admitted to an acute hospital in Hong Kong with AECOPD were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004, to April 30, 2005. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected and assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral culture. Spirometry was performed in the stable phase at 2 to 3 months after hospital discharge. Results There were 262 episodes of AECOPD among 196 patients (mean age, 75.7 \u00B1 7.7 years [\u00B1 SD]; 160 men). Mean FEV1 was 39.6 \u00B1 18.9% of predicted normal, and FEV1/FVC ratio was 58.0 \u00B1 15.2%. Fifty-eight episodes (22.1%) yielded positive viral PCR results. The viruses identified were influenza A (7.3%), coronavirus OC43 (4.6%), rhinovirus (3.1%), influenza B (2.7%), and respiratory syncytial virus (2.3%). The diagnostic yield of viral identification by PCR was 2.7 times higher than that based on conventional viral culture. The rates of identifying a positive viral etiology by PCR were similar among the subjects with FEV1 \u2265 50%, \u2265 30 to 50%, and \u003C 30% of predicted normal. Viral infection appeared to have no effect on subsequent readmissions or mortality rate over a study period of 1 year Conclusion Influenza A and two less-attended viruses, coronavirus OC43 and rhinovirus, were the common etiologic agents in patients hospitalized with AECOPD in Hong Kong. These should be considered in developing diagnostic and intervening strategies pertaining to AECOPD.","publish_time":"2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ko, Fanny W.S.; Ip, Margaret; Chan, Paul K.S.; Chan, Michael C.H.; To, Kin-Wang; Ng, Susanna S.S.; Chau, Shirley S.L.; Tang, Julian W.; Hui, David S.C.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d9d10f3bc6cf0898e828758fe3c9e32797ba0b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094736.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215366563; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215366563","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nasopharyngeal","Spirometry"],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":["Asia","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["viral etiology of AECOPD","Viral infection","positive viral etiology","episodes of AECOPD","positive viral PCR results","conventional viral culture","Introduction Viral respiratory infections","diagnostic yield of viral identification","Hong Kong","Mean FEV1","acute hospital","rhinovirus","Methods Patients","coronavirus OC43","influenza B","viruses","year Conclusion Influenza","study period","hospital discharge","mean age","acute exacerbations of COPD","respiratory syncytial virus","mortality rate","effect","common etiologic agents","times higher","subsequent readmissions","polymerase chain reaction","months","FVC ratio","stable phase","years","intervening strategies","subjects","rates","Asia","SD","Spirometry","Nasopharyngeal aspirate","men"],"language":"en"},

Data regarding the etiology of acute respiratory infection (ARI) is scarce in developing countries. The aim of this study was to identify the viral etiology of ARI/ALRI in hospitalized children and factors associated with increased length of stay (LoS) and severe disease presentation in Northern Jordan. This was a prospective viral surveillance study using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in children younger than 5 years admitted with ARI to two main hospitals in Northern Jordan during the winter of 2016. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other viruses. Demographic and clinical characteristics of RSV-positive patients were compared with those of RSV-negative patients. There were 479 patients hospitalized with ARI. Their mean age (standard deviation) was 10.4 (11.6) months. 53.9% tested positive for at least one virus, with RSV being the most commonly detected virus (34%). Compared with RSV-negative patients, RSV-positive patients were younger, more likely to have chronic lung disease, and more likely to present with cough, rhinorrhea, difficulty in breathing, retraction, flaring, grunting, wheezing, and a higher respiratory rate. Prematurity, presence of a chronic illness, oxygen saturation \u003C 90%, and atelectasis and consolidation on chest X-rays were significantly associated with an increased mean LoS. Patients with a history of prematurity had higher risk of severe disease (odds ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.5, 4.7; p = 0.001). Compared with patients 6 months old and younger, patients aged 6.1 to 12 months were less likely to have severe disease. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV)-positive ALRI was associated with increased odds of severe disease. Viruses are recognized as etiological agent of ARI/ALRI-associated morbidity in developing countries that need more attention and implementation of targeted strategies for prevention and detection. HMPV can be a cause of severe ALRI.","publish_time":"2019-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Awad, Samah; Khader, Yousef; Mansi, Moa\u0027th; Yusef, Dawood; Alawadin, Salah; Qudah, Walaa; Khasawneh, Ruba","journal":"J Pediatr Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1aefcef321326189d24aaa2fd4217171aab3e96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117070.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0039-1692972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32300275/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI"],"organizations":["ARI/ALRI"],"locations":["Northern Jordan"],"keyphrases":["RSV-positive patients","RSV-negative patients","positive ALRI","cause of severe ALRI","increased odds of severe disease","severe disease presentation","ALRI-associated morbidity","higher risk of severe disease","viral etiology of ARI","chronic lung disease","clinical characteristics of RSV","respiratory syncytial virus","children younger","etiology of acute respiratory infection","etiological agent of ARI","increased mean LoS","higher respiratory rate","Acute lower respiratory infection","hospitalized children","Northern Jordan","developing countries","HMPV","months old","detected virus","viruses","increased length of stay","major cause of morbidity","prospective viral surveillance study","chronic illness","odds ratio","history of prematurity","mean age","real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction","factors","implementation of targeted strategies","rhinorrhea","attention","main hospitals","years","atelectasis","difficulty","breathing","prevention","oxygen saturation","cough","presence","chest X-rays","Human metapneumovirus","consolidation","retraction","detection","standard deviation","mortality","winter","Data","confidence interval","Nasopharyngeal swabs","aim"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Viability, apoptosis and LRP2 level in TPC-1 cells treated with different doses of metformin for different time points were determined. Besides, protein levels of p-JNK1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in metformin-treated TPC-1 cells were detected by Western blot. Regulatory effects of LRP2 on the JNK pathway and cell viability in metformin-treated TPC-1 cells were assessed. RESULTS: Viability in TPC-1 cells gradually decreased with the treatment of increased doses of metformin either for 24 h or 48 h. The apoptotic rate was concentration-dependently elevated by metformin treatment. Relative levels of LRP2 and p-JNK1 were concentration-dependently downregulated by metformin treatment. In addition, overexpression of LRP2 partially abolished the inhibitory effect of metformin on the viability of TPC-1 cells. CONCLUSION: Metformin treatment suppresses the proliferative ability and induces apoptosis of TPC-1 cells by downregulating LRP2 to block the JNK pathway.","publish_time":"2020-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Yang; Cao, Lingling; Wang, Li; Liu, Lingping; Huang, Ying; Gong, Xuan","journal":"Onco Targets Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b22c9aa91ec989861466462585e303956e6ae949.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6954091.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32021253/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ott.s227915","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JNK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["metformin treatment","metformin-treated TPC","cells","viability of TPC","apoptosis of TPC","different doses of metformin","inhibitory effect of metformin","potential effect of metformin","treatment of increased doses of metformin","cell viability","downregulating LRP2","LRP2 level","apoptosis of thyroid cancer TPC","overexpression of LRP2","Relative levels of LRP2","JNK pathway","Regulatory effects of LRP2","p-JNK1","concentration","protein levels of p","cell line","different time points","proliferation","proliferative ability","N-terminal kinases","apoptotic rate","underlying mechanism","CONCLUSION","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","addition","Western blot","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Here, we characterize the oral mycobiome, including mycobiome-bacteriome interactions, in the setting of remission-induction chemotherapy (RIC) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Oral samples (n = 299) were prospectively collected twice weekly from 39 AML patients during RIC until neutrophil recovery. Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene (V4) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequencing were used to determine bacterial and fungal diversity and community composition. Intrakingdom and interkingdom network connectivity at baseline (T1) and at midpoint (T3) and a later time point (T6) were assessed via SPIEC-EASI (sparse inverse covariance estimation for ecological association inference). In this exploratory study, mycobiome \u03B1-diversity was not significantly associated with antibiotic or antifungal receipt. However, postchemotherapy mycobiome \u03B1-diversity was lower in subjects receiving high-intensity chemotherapy. Additionally, greater decreases in Malassezia levels were seen over time among patients on high-intensity RIC compared to low-intensity RIC (P = 0.003). A significantly higher relative abundance of Candida was found among patients who had infection (P = 0.008), while a significantly higher relative abundance of Fusarium was found among patients who did not get an infection (P = 0.03). Analyses of intrakingdom and interkingdom relationships at T1, T3, and T6 indicated that interkingdom connectivity increased over the course of IC as bacterial \u03B1-diversity diminished. In (to our knowledge) the first longitudinal mycobiome study performed during AML RIC, we found that mycobiome-bacteriome interactions are highly dynamic. Our study data suggest that inclusion of mycobiome analysis in the design of microbiome studies may be necessary to optimally understand the ecological and functional role of microbial communities in clinical outcomes.

In this study, we demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein is an important immunogenic site in patients with SARS and rabbits immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV. Serum samples from convalescent SARS patients and immunized rabbits had potent neutralizing activities against infection by pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV S protein. Depletion of RBD-specific antibodies from patient or rabbit immune sera by immunoadsorption significantly reduced serum-mediated neutralizing activity, while affinity-purified anti-RBD antibodies had relatively higher potency neutralizing infectivity of SARS pseudovirus, indicating that the RBD of S protein is a critical neutralization determinant of SARS-CoV during viral infection and immunization. Two monoclonal antibodies (1A5 and 2C5) targeting at the RBD of S protein were isolated from mice immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV. Both 1A5 and 2C5 possessed potent neutralizing activities, although they directed against distinct conformation-dependant epitopes as shown by ELISA and binding competition assay. We further demonstrated that 2C5, but not 1A5, was able to block binding of the RBD to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor on targeted cells. These data provide important information for understanding the antigenicity and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV and for designing SARS vaccines.","publish_time":"2005-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Yuxian; Zhu, Qingyu; Liu, Shuwen; Zhou, Yusen; Yang, Baoan; Li, Jiaming; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ce1c0fefe12e8f2aa0d0aa456582292aeb5b189.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111853.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268220500067X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268220500067X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["RBD"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV S protein","inactivated SARS-CoV","immunogenicity of SARS","SARS vaccines","RBD of S protein","convalescent SARS patients","infectivity of SARS pseudovirus","critical neutralization determinant of SARS","Depletion of RBD","receptor binding","anti-RBD antibodies","1A5","2C5","potent neutralizing activities","receptor-binding domain","immunized rabbits","specific antibodies","monoclonal antibodies","functional receptor","binding competition assay","reduced serum-mediated neutralizing activity","protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","Serum samples","viral infection","important information","important immunogenic site","immunoadsorption","higher potency","immune sera","affinity","ELISA","antigenicity","mice","protective immunity","distinct conformation-dependant epitopes","ACE2","angiotensin","targeted cells","enzyme","immunization","spike","data","study"],"language":"en"},

In addition to conventional medical treatment, there is a need for a holistic approach for early detection and prevention of viral outbreaks at a population level. One-Health is a relatively new integrative approach to the solving of global health challenges. A key component to the One-Health approach is the notion that human health, animal health, and environmental health are all innately interrelated. One-Health interventions, initiated by veterinary doctors, have proven to be effective in controlling outbreaks, but thus far the applications focus on zoonotic viruses transmitted from animals to humans. Environmental engineers and environmental scientists hold a critical role in the further development of One-Health approaches that include water-related transport and transmission of human, animal, and zoonotic viruses. In addition to waterborne viruses, the proposed approach is applicable to a wide range of viruses that are found in human excrement since contaminated water-based surveillance systems may be used for early detection of viral disease. This paper proposes a greater One-Health based framework that involves water-related pathways. The first step in the proposed framework is the identification of critical exposure pathways of viruses in the water environment. Identification of critical pathways informs the second and third steps, which include water-based surveillance systems for early detection at a population level and implementation of intervention approaches to block the critical pathways of exposure.","publish_time":"2019-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Brien, Evan; Xagoraraki, Irene","journal":"One Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3edd89544597d9f178b831aa1047475fe3910871.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c7db46cef4b3cc40d34dc09957d7a8c28da20fc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6501061.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771418300569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31080867/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2019.100094; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771418300569","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["human health","environmental health","Health approaches","animal health","public health","Health interventions","Health based framework","water-related pathways","zoonotic viruses","identification of critical exposure pathways of viruses","Identification of critical pathways","critical pathways of exposure","solving of global health challenges","proposed approach","water environment","waterborne viruses","early detection of viral disease","water-related transport","contaminated water-based surveillance systems","holistic approach","critical role","wide range of viruses","human excrement","transmission of human","proposed framework","new integrative approach","population level","prevention of viral outbreaks","environmental scientists","Environmental engineers","addition","heavy burden of viral disease","implementation of intervention approaches","notion","need","development","conventional medical treatment","veterinary doctors","consistent efforts","animals","humans","applications","steps","United States","key component","paper"],"language":"en"},

Clinically, it is mostly used to measure glomerular filtration rate as a marker for kidney function due to its relatively small molecular weight and easy detection. However, recent findings suggest that Cst C is regulated at both transcriptional and post\u2010translational levels, and Cst C production from haematopoietic cell lineages contributes significantly to the systematic pools of Cst C. Furthermore, Cst C is directly linked to many pathologic processes through various mechanisms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through a questionnaire, acoustically problematic rooms are identified. Noise levels in emergency rooms (ERs) and intensive care units (ICUs) are measured over about three days. Acoustically critical and problematic rooms in the otolaryngology department are measured including examination rooms, operating rooms, nurse stations, receptions, and patient rooms. RESULTS: The A-weighted equivalent noise level, L(Aeq), ranges from 54 to 56 dBA, which is at least 10 dB lower than the noise levels of 65 to 73 dBA measured in American ERs. In an ICU, the noise level for the first night was 66 dBA, which came down to 56 dBA for the next day. The noise levels during three different ear surgeries vary from 57 to 62 dBA, depending on the use of surgical drills and suctions. The noise levels in a patient room is found to be 47 dBA, while the nurse stations and the receptions have high noise levels up to 64 dBA. The reverberation times in an operation room, examination room, and single patient room are found to be below 0.6 s. CONCLUSIONS: At SNUH, the nurse stations and receptions were found to be quite noisy. The ERs were quieter than in the previous studies. The measured reverberation times seemed low enough but some other nurse stations and examination rooms were not satisfactory according to the questionnaire.","publish_time":"2019-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, Wan-Ho; Jeong, Cheol-Ho; Chang, Ji-Ho; Lee, Seong-Hyun; Park, Moo Kyun; Suh, Myung-Whan; Han, Jae Joon","journal":"J Audiol Otol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c25e786759a5c261fed053aeeb9298e36b8aed17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6468283.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30989997/; https://doi.org/10.7874/jao.2018.00269","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Seoul National University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dBA","examination rooms","high noise levels","patient rooms","problematic rooms","nurse stations","operating rooms","emergency rooms","operation room","receptions","single patient room","weighted equivalent noise level","measured reverberation times","room acoustic parameters","SNUH","American ERs","questionnaire","tertiary referral hospital","Seoul National University Hospital","otolaryngology department","intensive care units","OBJECTIVES","different ear surgeries","Aeq","use of surgical drills","dB lower","suctions","ICUs","Korea","BACKGROUND","night","previous studies","RESULTS","MATERIALS","METHODS","ranges","CONCLUSIONS","days"],"language":"en"},

Some features of these RNAs suggest that they are similar to defective interfering (DI) RNAs, and would be the first to be reported for the potexvirus group. The prototype 1.2-kb RNA is 1172 nucleotides in length excluding a probable poly(A) tail and is composed of two noncontiguous regions corresponding to 757 nucleotides of the 5\u2032 and 415 nucleotides of the 3\u2032 terminal of CYMV\u0027s gRNA. The sequence of the prototype 1.2-kb RNA reveals that the two terminal gRNA regions present in this RNA encode a single open reading frame (ORF) joining the N-terminus of the 191-kDa nonstructural product and the C-terminus of the coat protein to form a 35-kDa 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product. The coding properties of this prototype RNA have been confirmed by translation in vitro of native and synthetic transcripts of the 1.2-kb RNAs, both of which direct the synthesis of the anticipated 35-kDa product which reacts with anti-CYMV antiserum. Three additional 1.2-kb RNA species, each of which contains a unique junction site, have been characterized. In all cases, a fusion ORF encoding a 191-kDa/coat protein fusion product is encoded on the RNA. The presence of a fusion ORF in all members of the 1.2-kb RNA species analyzed suggests that maintenance of this ORF may be important for the survival of this class of RNA within the plant. This coding strategy represents a novel property of plant virus defective RNAs.","publish_time":"1991-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"White, K.Andrew; Brancroft, J.

This case study introduces a conceptual framework that draws from theoretical change models but is also grounded in the reality of the change environment at this organization. Realizing major organizational change is a complex process influenced by the characteristics of an organization, the integrated project and change management framework, and the importance of key leadership roles throughout the change process. Results from this study suggest that effective change implementation was enabled by leadership, program management, and change ownership, integrated with project implementation.","publish_time":"2010-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cowan-Sahadath, Kathy","journal":"International Journal of Project Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f5138ab488c10f2d25c938f10db8acdb561edbf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263786309001513; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0263786309001513","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hydro One"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["change process","change environment","effective change implementation","Cornerstone Program","major organizational change","theoretical change models","business needs","business infrastructure","program management","streamlined business operations","significant business transformation","management framework","project implementation","integrated project","future strategic position of Hydro","strategic decisions","conceptual framework","complex process","case study","importance of key leadership roles","information","rapid access","characteristics","improvements","entire structure","ownership","vision","Results","growing requirements","strategy","reality"],"language":"en"},

Through this study, we aimed to detail the outcomes of hMPV infections. MATERIALS/METHODS: Between January 2012 and November 2017, patients who had hMPV detected in nasopharyngeal or bronchoalveolar lavage by molecular respiratory pathogen tests were evaluated. The Food and Drug Administration cleared multiplexed\u2010polymerase chain reaction system (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT) was used for diagnosis. Chest radiography (CR) and computed tomography (CT) were evaluated by an expert radiologist. RESULTS: In total 100 patients were included, the mean age was 22.9 (0\u201087) years, and 50% were male. The hospitalization rate was 52%. Lower respiratory system infection (LRTI) was diagnosed in 44 patients with clinical findings, and in 31 patients out of 44 the radiological findings supported the diagnosis. The LRTI rate was significantly higher in adults than children (66.7%\u201032.8%; P = 0.001). In CR, peribronchovascular infiltration (PI) was the most common feature seen in 14 out of 18 patients and was generally bilateral (13 out of 18 patients). In CT imaging, ground\u2010glass opacity was the most common finding seen in 11 out of 16 patients and nodular consolidation in five patients. Ribavirin was given to four patients, three of whom were severe and required respiratory support. None of the patients died of hMPV infection. CONCLUSIONS: The ground\u2010glass opacity in CT was similar to other respiratory virus infections, and PI in CR was very common and typical; however, nodular consolidation that may mimic bacterial infection was seen in one\u2010fourth of CT.","publish_time":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keske, \u015Eiran; G\u00FCm\u00FC\u015F, Terman; K\u00F6ymen, Tamer; Sand\u0131k\u00E7\u0131, Sunay; Tabak, Levet; Erg\u00F6n\u00FCl, \u00D6nder","journal":"J Med Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a50aeba3190c2ee8c0edf32ac38b61f6e09f9e6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166911.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30659630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","respiratory virus infections","CR","respiratory support","Lower respiratory system infection","severe respiratory tract infections","outcomes of hMPV infections","glass opacity","molecular respiratory pathogen tests","CT imaging","nodular consolidation","common finding","LRTI rate","bacterial infection","detected virus","common feature","diagnosis","radiological findings","clinical findings","hospitalization rate","polymerase chain reaction system","Idaho Technology","bronchoalveolar lavage","Salt Lake City","Drug Administration","computed tomography","adults","Chest radiography","Food","BACKGROUND","Human metapneumovirus","peribronchovascular infiltration","CONCLUSIONS","children","RESULTS","mean age","expert radiologist","MATERIALS","METHODS","years","male","Ribavirin","study"],"language":"en"},

A total of 8696 parturients were enrolled, of whom 113 with prenatal positive HBeAg were invited back. The prevalence of HBsAg decreased over the study period, particularly in the vaccinated cohort, while there was no change in the prevalence of HBeAg. Foreign parturients had a higher HBeAg-positive rate and delayed HBeAg clearance, and those with a higher body mass index (\u003E24 kg/m(2)) had earlier HBeAg clearance (51.9% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.005). Only 30% of the subjects who were positive for HBeAg before birth became negative 5 years after delivery. In conclusion, the downward trend in HB infection with more significance among vaccinated parturients reflects effective prevention and the impact of universal HB immunization.

Residents from two other homeless shelters (B and C) used shelter A\u0027s day center services. Testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was offered to available residents and staff members at the three shelters during March 30-April 1, 2020. Among the 181 persons tested, 19 (10.5%) had positive test results (15 residents and four staff members). On April 1, PHSKC and CDC collaborated to conduct site assessments and symptom screening, isolate ill residents and staff members, reinforce infection prevention and control practices, provide face masks, and advise on sheltering-in-place. Repeat testing was offered April 7-8 to all residents and staff members who were not tested initially or who had negative test results. Among the 118 persons tested in the second round of testing, 18 (15.3%) had positive test results (16 residents and two staff members). In addition to the 31 residents and six staff members identified through testing at the shelters, two additional cases in residents were identified during separate symptom screening events, and four were identified after two residents and two staff members independently sought health care. In total, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 35 of 195 (18%) residents and eight of 38 (21%) staff members who received testing at the shelter or were evaluated elsewhere. COVID-19 can spread quickly in homeless shelters; rapid interventions including testing and isolation to identify cases and minimize transmission are necessary. CDC recommends that homeless service providers implement appropriate infection control practices, apply physical distancing measures including ensuring resident\u0027s heads are at least 6 feet (2 meters) apart while sleeping, and promote use of cloth face coverings among all residents (1).","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tobolowsky, Farrell A; Gonzales, Elysia; Self, Julie L; Rao, Carol Y; Keating, Ryan; Marx, Grace E; McMichael, Temet M; Lukoff, Margaret D; Duchin, Jeffrey S; Huster, Karin; Rauch, Jody; McLendon, Hedda; Hanson, Matthew; Nichols, Dave; Pogosjans, Sargis; Fagalde, Meaghan; Lenahan, Jennifer; Maier, Emily; Whitney, Holly; Sugg, Nancy; Chu, Helen; Rogers, Julia; Mosites, Emily; Kay, Meagan","journal":"MMWR.

The purpose of this paper was to analyze altered cellular protein levels in porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV)-infected swine testicular (ST) cells in order to determine potential virus-host interactions. A proteomic approach using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-coupled two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identification was conducted on the TGEV-infected ST cells. The results showed that the 4-plex iTRAQ-based quantitative approach identified 4,112 proteins, 146 of which showed significant changes in expression 48 h after infection. At 64 h post infection, 219 of these proteins showed significant change, further indicating that a larger number of proteomic changes appear to occur during the later stages of infection. Gene ontology analysis of the altered proteins showed enrichment in multiple biological processes, including cell adhesion, response to stress, generation of precursor metabolites and energy, cell motility, protein complex assembly, growth, developmental maturation, immune system process, extracellular matrix organization, locomotion, cell-cell signaling, neurological system process, and cell junction organization. Changes in the expression levels of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03B21), caspase-8, and heat shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90\u03B1) were also verified by western blot analysis. To our knowledge, this study is the first time the response profile of ST host cells following TGEV infection has been analyzed using iTRAQ technology, and our description of the late proteomic changes that are occurring after the time of vigorous viral production are novel. Therefore, this study provides a solid foundation for further investigation, and will likely help us to better understand the mechanisms of TGEV infection and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2014-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ma, Ruili; Zhang, Yanming; Liu, Haiquan; Ning, Pengbo","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02766b20eeb39ff051a2f110def2e4bf8b9b010b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4204940.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333634/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs5OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ST","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-cell","viral infection","mechanisms of TGEV infection","cell motility","cell adhesion","cell junction organization","TGEV-infected ST cells","significant changes","h post infection","late proteomic changes","later stages of infection","altered proteins","proteomic approach","response profile of ST host cells","larger number of proteomic changes","altered cellular protein levels","protein complex assembly","plex iTRAQ","iTRAQ technology","potential virus-host interactions","study","immune system process","neurological system process","heat shock protein","expression levels of transforming growth factor beta","time of vigorous viral production","quantitative approach","extracellular matrix organization","infected swine testicular","Gene ontology analysis","western blot analysis","developmental maturation","porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","energy","multiple biological processes","two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identification","generation of precursor metabolites","isobaric tags","stress","enrichment","order","locomotion","absolute quantitation","TGF-\u03B21","HSP90\u03B1","description","caspase","alpha","novel","paper","solid foundation","pathogenesis","investigation","results","purpose","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that comprehensive national data on ICU resources would permit a better understanding of regional differences in system capacity. METHODS: After the 2009\u20132010 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group surveyed all acute care hospitals in Canada to assess ICU capacity. Using a structured survey tool administered to physicians, respiratory therapists and nurses, we determined the number of ICU beds, ventilators, and the ability to provide specialized support for respiratory failure. RESULTS: We identified 286 hospitals with 3170 ICU beds and 4982 mechanical ventilators for critically ill patients. Twenty-two hospitals had an ICU that routinely cared for children; 15 had dedicated pediatric ICUs. Per 100,000 population, there was substantial variability in provincial capacity, with a mean of 0.9 hospitals with ICUs (provincial range 0.4-2.8), 10 ICU beds capable of providing mechanical ventilation (provincial range 6\u201319), and 15 invasive mechanical ventilators (provincial range 10\u201324). There was only moderate correlation between ventilation capacity and population size (coefficient of determination (R(2)) = 0.771). CONCLUSION: ICU resources vary widely across Canadian provinces, and during times of increased demand, may result in geographic differences in the ability to care for critically ill patients.

However, comparatively few wildlife epidemiological studies use quantitative PCR (qPCR) for pathogen detection, even fewer employ an internal control, to ensure confidence in negative results, and PCR\u2019s ability to multiplex and therefore detect several targets in a single reaction is underutilised. Here, we describe the development of two multiplex qPCR assays for the red and grey squirrel that detect the pathogens squirrelpox virus (SQPV) and adenovirus in squirrels (SADV), both of which cause mortality in the red squirrel. Both assays use a section of the squirrel phosphoglycerate kinase gene as an endogenous internal control that identifies and compensates for both, inadequate sampling or PCR inhibition. Tests on infected squirrel tissue demonstrate that simple swab samples (particularly from distal antebrachial skin) are sufficient to detect and identify the relative quantity of SQPV DNA in both squirrel species, while rectal swabs and blood cell pellets can be used to reliably indicate SADV infection. These assays are sensitive and specific with an endogenous internal control providing confidence in negative results and allowing comparison across laboratories. Using such assays should prove advantageous in wildlife studies with limited resources while allowing the maximum data yield.

This study assesses whether co-infection with 2 viruses as compared with 1 is associated with increased hospitalization in those with acute respiratory infections. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled a cohort of pediatric and adult participants with influenza-like illness during 2010\u20132014 in Mexico. Clinical information and respiratory samples were collected at enrollment. Respiratory viruses were detected with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and influenza-specific reverse transcription PCR assays. Participants were followed for 14 and 28 days after inclusion. Severity of disease, as measured by hospitalization with acute respiratory infections, was compared between single and dual viral infections. RESULTS: Among 5662 participants in the study, either 1 (n = 3285) or 2 (n = 641) viruses were detected in 3926 participants. Rhinovirus (n = 1433), influenza (n = 888), and coronaviruses (n = 703) were the most frequently detected viruses (either alone or in co-infection). Bocavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus, and rhinovirus cases were hospitalized more often than other viruses. Bocavirus\u002Brhinovirus cases were hospitalized more often than those with rhinovirus alone (but not bocavirus alone). RSV cases were more likely to be hospitalized than cases with co-infections of RSV and parainfluenza virus or coronavirus. Metapneumovirus cases were hospitalized more often than those co-infected with metapneumovirus\u002Bcoronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, detection of 2 viruses did not significantly increase hospitalizations compared with single virus infections. Larger studies will allow for distinguishing between sequential and simultaneous infection and for a better understanding of the role of each virus during the evolution of acute respiratory episodes.","publish_time":"2019-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Noyola, Daniel E; Hunsberger, Sally; Vald\u00E9s Salgado, Raydel; Powers, John H; Galindo-Fraga, Arturo; Ortiz-Hern\u00E1ndez, Ana A; Ramirez-Venegas, Alejandra; Moreno-Espinosa, Sarbelio; Llamosas-Gallardo, Beatriz; Guerrero, M Lourdes; Beigel, John H; Ruiz-Palacios, Guillermo; Perez-Patrigeon, Santiago","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39a7144b3eb9ddf5b9076163aa61099d8b58f977.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6824528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696140/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofz424","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["Respiratory viruses","acute respiratory infections","rhinovirus cases","detected viruses","co-infections of RSV","RSV cases","Metapneumovirus cases","respiratory syncytial virus","single virus infections","respiratory samples","study","Bocavirus","evolution of acute respiratory episodes","simultaneous detection","parainfluenza virus","simultaneous infection","adult participants","dual viral infections","Molecular detection methods","influenza-specific reverse transcription PCR assays","increased hospitalization","multiplex polymerase chain reaction","better understanding","role","cohort of pediatric","illness","hospitalizations","Clinical information","BACKGROUND","infectious agents","enrollment","CONCLUSIONS","coronaviruses","Larger studies","Severity of disease","days","inclusion","Mexico","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Most of the previous convergence studies have taken a retrospective view in measuring the degree of convergence and monitoring the converging trends. This paper proposes a quantitative future-oriented approach to technological opportunity discovery for convergence using patent information. In a future-oriented approach, technological opportunities for convergence are suggested by predicting potential technological knowledge flows (TKFs) between heterogeneous fields. The potential TKFs are predicted by a link prediction method in a directed network, which is suggested in this paper to represent the direction of the predicted TKFs by adapting the concept of bibliographic coupling and edge-betweenness centrality. Converging technological opportunities are proposed as incremental and radical technological opportunities by extracting the potential increased knowledge flow links and emerging knowledge flow links. Moreover, the direction and themes of the predicted potential TKFs are provided as technological opportunities for convergence. As an illustration of the proposed method, the technological opportunities between biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT) are explored.

Communityacquired human coronaviruses have long been recognized to cause common cold. However, zoonotic coronaviruses are now becoming more a global concern with the discovery of highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses causing severe respiratory diseases. Infections by these emerging human coronaviruses are characterized by less robust interferon production. Treatment of patients with recombinant interferon regimen promises beneficial outcomes, suggesting that compromised interferon expression might contribute at least partially to the severity of disease. The mechanisms by which coronaviruses evade host innate antiviral response are under intense investigations. This review focuses on the fierce arms race between host innate antiviral immunity and emerging human coronaviruses. Particularly, the host pathogen recognition receptors and the signal transduction pathways to mount an effective antiviral response against SARS and MERS coronavirus infection are discussed. On the other hand, the counter-measures evolved by SARS and MERS coronaviruses to circumvent host defense are also dissected. With a better understanding of the dynamic interaction between host and coronaviruses, it is hoped that insights on the pathogenesis of newly-identified highly pathogenic human coronaviruses and new strategies in antiviral development can be derived.

During the period from 1999 to 2007, applications of MAGE in cancer investigation have shifted from molecular profiling, identifying previously undiscovered cancer types, predicting outcomes of cancer patients, revealing metastasis signatures of solid tumors, to guiding the use of therapeutics. The roles of cancer genomic signatures have evolved through three phases. In the first phase, genomic signatures were described in stored cancer specimens and dubbed as molecular portraits of cancer. When gene expression profiles were carefully correlated with sufficient clinical information of cancer patients, new subgroups of cancers with distinct outcomes were revealed. In studies of the second phase, validation of cancer signatures was emphasized and commonly performed with independent groups of cancer specimens or independent data set. In the third phase, cancer genomic signatures have been further expanded beyond depicting the molecular portrait of cancer to predicting patient outcomes and guiding the use of cancer therapeutics. Cancer genomic signatures have become an essential part of a new generation of cancer clinical trials. It is advocated that, in future clinical trials of cancer therapy, the cancer specimens of each participant should be tested for currently available predictor genomic signatures, so that the most effective treatment with the least adverse effects for each patient can be identified. Then, participants can be triaged to an appropriate study group.","publish_time":"2007-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Tzu-Hao; Chao, Angel","journal":"Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb0ce67ce8fdfac2b785a03b2527fb8d5690496c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1028455908600248; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455908600248","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cancer investigation","validation of cancer signatures","roles of cancer genomic signatures","outcomes of cancer patients","stored cancer specimens","molecular portrait of cancer","molecular portraits of cancer","use of cancer therapeutics","undiscovered cancer types","independent groups of cancer specimens","new generation of cancer clinical trials","sufficient clinical information of cancer patients","future clinical trials of cancer therapy","available predictor genomic signatures","patient outcomes","metastasis signatures of solid tumors","distinct outcomes","molecular profiling","use of therapeutics","gene expression profiles","applications of MAGE","beauty of microarray analysis of gene expression","new subgroups of cancers","independent data set","adverse effects","effective treatment","pathologic event","Summary","appropriate study group","studies","phases","participants","period","genes"],"language":"en"},

However, in the setting of the global COVID-19 pandemic, alternative care models should be explored. Objective To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of home immunotherapy self-administration (HITSA) in a highly idealized circumstance for provision of maintenance allergen immunotherapy in a shelter-in-place or other scenarios of unforeseen reduction in non-essential medical services. Methods Markov modeling was used to compare in-office clinic allergen immunotherapy in selected patients using cohort analysis and microsimulation from the societal and healthcare perspectives. Results Assuming similar SRIT rates, HITSA was found to be a cost-effective option with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $44,554/QALY (quality adjusted life year) when considering both incremental epinephrine autoinjector (EAI) costs and COVID-19 risks. Excluding EAI costs, HISTA dominated other options. However, outside of pandemic considerations, HITSA was not cost effective (ICER $198,877,286) at annual EAI costs above $287. As the incremental HITSA SRIT rate increased above 15%, clinic AIT was the most cost-effective strategy. Excluding both pandemic risks and risk of motor vehicle accident fatality from round-trip clinic transit, clinic AIT dominated other strategies. Clinic AIT was the more cost-effective option at very high fatality relative risk for HITSA or at very low annual risk of contracting COVID-19. Conclusion Under idealized assumptions HITSA can be a safe and cost-effective option during a global pandemic in appropriately selected patients provided home rates of SRIT remain stable.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaker, Marcus S.; Mosnaim, Giselle; Oppenheimer, John; Stukus, David; Abrams, Elissa M.; Greenhawt, Matthew","journal":"The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

This study aims to understand how family caregivers\u2019 mental health and caregiver burden affects physical health simultaneously, controlling for factors such as age, education level, caring hours per day, and emotional, functional, and physical support systems used by caregivers. We recruited 388 caregivers from Kaohsiung and Pingtong region in Taiwan. Caregivers had to be 18 years or older and spend most of their time taking care of an ill family member at home. Mental health was assessed by the 12-item Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ-12) and burden was measured using a modified scale for caregiver\u0027s burden. Health status was assessed by self-perceived health (SPH), illness symptoms and the number of diagnosed chronic diseases. A high number of hours per day of caregiving was associated with low emotional support and SPH, poor mental health and high burden. Higher emotional support was associated with better mental health and fewer illness symptoms. Higher physical support was associated with poorer mental health, higher burden, a greater number of illness symptoms and chronic diseases, and a lower SPH score. Hours per day of caregiving, and use of emotional, functional, and physical support were associated with mental health, and the hours per day of caregiving and use of physical support were predictors of burden. Mental health and burden were significantly associated with caregivers\u2019 health problems simultaneously. Our results show the important influence of mental health on caregivers\u2019 physical health.

Recently, antiviral aloe anthraquinones had been reported against human influenza virus. In the present work two anthraquinones, aloesaponarin-I (1) and aloesaponarin-II (2) were isolated from A. vera roots, and six derivatives were obtained by methylation (3), acetylation (4) and O-glycosyl (5-6) reactions starting from (1). Additionally, a new Tetra-O-acetyl-\u03B2-d-glucopyranosyl derivative from 2 was also prepared. All compounds were evaluated against two strains of influenza virus AH1N1 by cytopathic effect reduction assay (CPE). The antiviral activity was determined by the ability of compounds to inhibit virus replication on Madin Darby Canine Kidney cells (MDCK). New derivatives 3-(2\u00B4,3\u00B4,4\u00B4,6\u00B4-Tetra-O-acetyl-\u03B2-d-glucopyranosyl-aloesaponarin-I (5) and 3-(2\u00B4,3\u00B4,4\u00B4,6\u00B4-Tetra-O-acetyl-\u03B2-d-glucopyranosyl- aloesaponarin-II (7) showed a cytopathic reduction effect against influenza strain A/Yucat\u00E1n/2370/09 with IC50 of 30.77 and 13.70 \u03BCM, and against the virus A/Mexico/InDRE797/10 with IC50 of 62.28 and 19.47 \u03BCM, respectively. To assess the effect of derivatives 5 and 7 during one cycle of replication (0\u201310 h), a time-of-addition experiment was performed. As a result it was found that both compounds were most effective when added 6\u201310 h post-infection and significantly inhibited viral titre (\u003E 70%) at the concentrations of 50 and 100 \u03BCM. Based on the structural analysis of the compounds, it was suggested that the Tetra-O-acetyl-\u03B2-d-glucopyranosyl substituent at the C3 position of the anthraquinone might have an effect against the influenza AH1N1 virus.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borges-Arg\u00E1ez, Roc\u00EDo; Chan-Balan, Reyna; Cetina-Montejo, Lisseth; Ayora-Talavera, Guadalupe; Sansores-Peraza, Pablo; G\u00F3mez-Carballo, Jes\u00FAs; C\u00E1ceres-Farf\u00E1n, Mirbella","journal":"Industrial Crops and Products","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d7c34a9712cade4afa2dbe07ef84dc1a9dd2791.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138392.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.02.056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669019301578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288269/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926669019301578","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Madin Darby Canine Kidney"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acetyl-\u03B2","aloesaponarin","influenza AH1N1 virus","new Tetra-O","virus replication","effect of derivatives","human influenza virus","d-glucopyranosyl substituent","d-glucopyranosyl derivative","strains of influenza virus AH1N1","O-glycosyl","\u03BCM","cytopathic reduction effect","influenza strain","ability of compounds","New derivatives","cytopathic effect reduction assay","antiviral aloe anthraquinones","IC50","Abstract Aloe vera","cycle of replication","vera roots","antiviral activity","h post-infection","Madin Darby Canine Kidney cells","crop of wide economic value of worldwide distribution","MDCK","C3 position","rich source of quinone components","CPE","Yucat\u00E1n","viral titre","time","present work","Mexico","InDRE797","addition experiment","methylation","structural analysis","acetylation","reactions","concentrations","result"],"language":"en"},

We describe two hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection in Daejeon caused by a single patient who was infected by the first Korean case of MERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and clinical information involving MERS cases in the Daejeon cluster were retrospectively collected and potential contacts and exposures were assessed. The incubation periods and serial intervals were estimated. Viral RNAs were extracted from respiratory tract samples obtained from the index case, four secondary cases and one tertiary case from each hospital. The partial S2 domain of the MERS-CoV spike was sequenced. RESULTS: In Daejeon, a MERS patient (the index case) was hospitalized at Hospital A in the first week of illness and was transferred to Hospital B because of pneumonia progression in the second week of illness, where he received a bronchoscopic examination and nebulizer therapy. A total of 23 secondary cases (10 in Hospital A and 13 in Hospital B) were detected among patients and caregivers who stayed on the same ward with the index case. There were no secondary cases among healthcare workers. Among close hospital contacts, the secondary attack rate was 15.8% (12/76) in Hospital A and 14.3% (10/70) in Hospital B. However, considering the exposure duration, the incidence rate was higher in Hospital B (7.7/100 exposure-days) than Hospital A (3.4/100 exposure-days). In Hospital B, the median incubation period was shorter (4.6 days vs. 10.8 days), the median time to pneumonia development was faster (3 days vs. 6 days) and mortality was higher (70% vs. 30.8%) than in Hospital A. MERS-CoV isolates from 11 cases formed a single monophyletic clade, with the closest similarity to strains from Riyadh. CONCLUSION: Exposure to the MERS case in the late stage (2nd week) of diseases appeared to increase the risk of transmission and was associated with shorter incubation periods and rapid disease progression among those infected. Early detection and isolation of cases is critical in preventing the spread of MERS in the hospital and decreasing the disease severity among those infected.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Sun Hee; Kim, Yeon-Sook; Jung, Younghee; Choi, Soo young; Cho, Nam-Hyuk; Jeong, Hye Won; Heo, Jung Yeon; Yoon, Ji Hyun; Lee, Jacob; Cheon, Shinhye; Sohn, Kyung Mok","journal":"Infect Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/065497953c64b5163eb29e9a4fe78534f244ca26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4945733.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2016.48.2.99; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27433380/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea","Hospital A.

The current review describes the overall strength of the Chinese HIV surveillance system and its structural weaknesses from a political and social perspective. The HIV surveillance system in China has undergone substantial revamping leading to a comprehensive, timely and efficient reporting system. However, large data gaps and lack of quality control and sharing of information obstruct the full performance of the system. This is largely due to fragmented authoritarianism brought about by the underlying political structure.

Practical diagnosis of canine distemper based on clinical signs and laboratory tests are required to confirm CDV infection. The present study aimed to develop a molecular assay to detect and differentiate field and vaccine CDV strains. Reverse transcription followed by nested real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-nqPCR) was developed, which exhibited analytical specificity (all the samples from healthy dogs and other canine infectious agents were not incorrectly detected) and sensitivity (all replicates of a vaccine strain were positive up to the 3125-fold dilution \u2013 100.7 TCID50). RT-nqPCR was validated for CDV detection on different clinical samples (blood, urine, rectal and conjunctival swabs) of 103 animals suspected to have distemper. A total of 53 animals were found to be positive based on RT-nqPCR in at least one clinical sample. Blood resulted in more positive samples (50 out of 53, 94.3%), followed by urine (44/53, 83.0%), rectal (38/53, 71%) and conjunctival (27/53, 50.9%) swabs. A commercial immunochromatography (IC) assay had detected CDV in only 30 conjunctival samples of these positive dogs. Nucleoprotein (NC) gene sequencing of 25 samples demonstrated that 23 of them were closer to other Brazilian field strains and the remaining two to vaccine strains. A single nucleotide sequences difference, which creates an Msp I restriction enzyme digestion, was used to differentiate between field and vaccine CDV strains by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The complete assay was more sensitive than was IC for the detection of CDV. Blood was the more frequently positive specimen and the addition of a restriction enzyme step allowed the differentiation of vaccine and Brazilian field strains.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fischer, Cristine Dossin Bastos; Ikuta, Nilo; Canal, Cl\u00E1udio Wageck; Makiejczuk, Aline; Allgayer, Mariangela da Costa; Cardoso, Cristine Hoffmeister; Lehmann, Fernanda Kieling; Fonseca, Andr\u00E9 Salvador Kazantzi; Lunge, Vagner Ricardo","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2239c1dd1a7f18280cc59b62f43be30d25dd26a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113657.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093413003340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23942341/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093413003340; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.08.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nucleoprotein"],"organizations":["CDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine CDV strains","vaccine strains","positive samples","CDV detection","detection of CDV","CDV infection","conjunctival samples","positive dogs","Brazilian field strains","different clinical samples","differentiation of vaccine","RT-nqPCR","blood","positive specimen","conjunctival swabs","clinical signs","restriction enzyme step","restriction enzyme digestion","healthy dogs","Abstract Canine distemper virus","Practical diagnosis of canine distemper","molecular assay","urine","complete assay","animals","canine infectious agents","restriction fragment length polymorphism","nested real time polymerase chain reaction","RFLP","Msp","addition","laboratory tests","Reverse transcription","analysis","gene sequencing","cause","single nucleotide sequences difference","contagious disease","Nucleoprotein","commercial immunochromatography","present study","fold dilution","analytical specificity","TCID50","total","sensitivity"],"language":"en"},

Cationic host defence peptides, such as defensins and cathelicidins, are important components of innate immunity with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory capabilities.

We begin this review by considering the first commercially-available JNK ATP-competitive inhibitor, SP600125. We focus on recent studies that have evaluated the actions of SP600125 in lung, brain, kidney and liver following exposure to a range of stress insults including ischemia/reperfusion. In many but not all cases, SP600125 administration has proved beneficial. JNK activation can also follow infection, and we next consider recent examples that demonstrate the benefits of SP600125 administration in viral infection. Additional ATP-competitive JNK inhibitors have now been described following high throughput screening of small molecule libraries, but information on their use in biological systems remains limited and thus these inhibitors will require further evaluation. Peptide substrate-competitive ATP-non-competitive inhibitors of JNK have also now been described, and we discuss the recent advances in the use of JNK inhibitory peptides in the treatment of neuronal death, diabetes and viral infection. We conclude by raising a number of questions that should be considered in the quest for JNK-specific inhibitors.","publish_time":"2007-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bogoyevitch, Marie A.; Arthur, Peter G.","journal":"Biochim Biophys Acta Proteins Proteom","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30f527ca58ab6bff727209999d7eeaabd5dd51fc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185448.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570963907002452; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570963907002452","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["JNK-specific inhibitors","Additional ATP-competitive JNK inhibitors","design of JNK","JNK activation","Peptide substrate-competitive ATP-non-competitive inhibitors of JNK","available JNK ATP-competitive inhibitor","selective inhibitors","use of JNK inhibitory peptides","actions of SP600125","viral infection","benefits of SP600125 administration","recent advances","recent examples","recent studies","following high throughput screening of small molecule libraries","treatment of neuronal death","exposure","information","brain","range of stress insults","liver","lung","kidney","diabetes","biological systems","JNKs","N-terminal kinases","ischemia","discovery","reperfusion","potential","cases","subject of intense","Major research programs","drugs","number of questions","evaluation","review"],"language":"en"},

This interference with nuclear import requires interaction between protein 6 and cellular karyopherins, a process that typically involves nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs. Here we dissected protein 6 using site-directed mutagenesis and found no evidence for a classical NLS.

Myco Curb (MC) contains organic acids and is used as a feed additive to inhibit growth of many bacteria and toxin-producing molds but not viruses. Studies evaluating the influence of MC on BW, feed conversion, and mortality indicate that turkey poults tolerate MC at 1.25% but not 2.50%, but higher MC content in feed provides greater suppression of growth of bacterial isolates commonly associated with PEMS. In two PEMS experiments, 1.25% MC was blended into poult starter feed and was maintained in the feed for the duration of the 3-wk experiments. In these experiments, 1-d-old commercial poults were placed into battery brooders and were given turkey starter feed and water ad libitum. At 6 d posthatch, PEMS-designated poults were given a 1-mL oral gavage of a 10% suspension of feces from PEMS-infected poults. BW depression due to PEMS was not alleviated by MC, although there was less variation in mean BW of the MC-fed poults, and there was a highly significant reduction in mortality (68% in PEMS-exposed with MC vs. 32.5% in PEMS-exposed without MC). The reduction in mortality in the MC-fed poults was attributed to decreased bacterial content of the gut and to maintenance of packed cell volume and hemoglobin content. It was concluded that MC might be a potential nutritional intervention during PEMS.","publish_time":"2002-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roy, RD; Edens, FW; Parkhurst, CR; Qureshi, MA; Havenstein, GB","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/475c30b92a6a6da5b490449ac9f4329ac6b710f7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119436766; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119436766","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MC","PEMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influence of MC","PEMS experiments","PEMS-infected poults","PEMS-designated poults","higher MC content","turkey poults","feed conversion","feed additive","turkey starter feed","poult starter feed","mortality syndrome","bacterial content","d-old commercial poults","hemoglobin content","bacterial isolates","mean BW","BW depression","viruses","wk experiments","d posthatch","significant reduction","greater suppression of growth","Abstract Poult enteritis","Escherichia coli isolates","battery brooders","maintenance of packed cell volume","gut","multiple etiological agents","water ad libitum","suspension of feces","occurrence","toxin","organic acids","potential nutritional intervention","variation","Myco Curb","molds","duration","oral gavage","Studies"],"language":"en"},

Intracerebral infection of CCL2\u2212/\u2212 mice with MHV did not result in increased morbidity or mortality as compared to either wild type or CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice and CCL2\u2212/\u2212 mice cleared replicating virus from the brain. In contrast, CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed an impaired ability to clear virus from the brain that was accompanied by a reduction in the numbers of antigen-specific T cells as compared to both CCL2\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice. The paucity in T cell accumulation within the central nervous system (CNS) of MHV-infected CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice was not the result of either a deficiency in antigen-presenting cell (APC) accumulation within draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) or the generation of virus-specific T cells within this compartment. A similar reduction in macrophage infiltration into the CNS was observed in both CCL2\u2212/\u2212 and CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to wild-type mice, indicating that both CCL2 and CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) contribute to macrophage migration and accumulation within the CNS following MHV infection. Together, these data demonstrate that CCR2, but not CCL2, is important in host defense following viral infection of the CNS, and CCR2 ligand(s), other than CCL2, participates in generating a protective response.","publish_time":"2004-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Held, Katherine S.; Chen, Benjamin P.; Kuziel, William A.; Rollins, Barrett J.; Lane, Thomas E.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a272a5d44cb8055d0af795f3bdfd3930538ef103.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111831.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682204005938; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682204005938","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Intracerebral infection of CCL2","wild-type mice","MHV infection","CCR2 ligand","MHV-infected CCR2","CNS","T cell accumulation","microbial infection","viral infection","wild type","T cell polarization","specific T cells","generation of virus","replicating virus","CC chemokine ligand","macrophage migration","host defense","CC chemokine receptor","brain","result","consequences of mouse hepatitis virus","leukocyte migration","numbers of antigen","macrophage infiltration","infected tissues","similar reduction","immune response","protective response","draining cervical lymph nodes","central nervous system","CLN","APC","monocyte chemoattractant protein","mortality","present study","impaired ability","increased morbidity","deficiency","compartment","paucity","contrast","data","order"],"language":"en"},

This study was done to determine if serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations correlated with the incidence of acute viral respiratory tract infections. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: In this prospective cohort study serial monthly concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured over the fall and winter 2009\u20132010 in 198 healthy adults, blinded to the nature of the substance being measured. The participants were evaluated for the development of any acute respiratory tract infections by investigators blinded to the 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. The incidence of infection in participants with different concentrations of vitamin D was determined. One hundred ninety-five (98.5%) of the enrolled participants completed the study. Light skin pigmentation, lean body mass, and supplementation with vitamin D were found to correlate with higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

It is caused by a small RNA virus (PRRSV), which targets almost exclusively pig monocytes or macrophages. In the present study, five SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) libraries derived from 0 hour mock-infected and 6, 12, 16 and 24 hours PRRSV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) produced a total 643,255 sequenced tags with 91,807 unique tags. Differentially expressed (DE) tags were then detected using the Bayesian framework followed by gene/mRNA assignment, arbitrary selection and manual annotation, which determined 699 DE genes for reactome analysis. The DAVID, KEGG and REACTOME databases assigned 573 of the DE genes into six biological systems, 60 functional categories and 504 pathways. The six systems are: cellular processes, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, metabolism, organismal systems and human diseases as defined by KEGG with modification. Self-organizing map (SOM) analysis further grouped these 699 DE genes into ten clusters, reflecting their expression trends along these five time points. Based on the number one functional category in each system, cell growth and death, transcription processes, signal transductions, energy metabolism, immune system and infectious diseases formed the major reactomes of PAMs responding to PRRSV infection. Our investigation also focused on dominant pathways that had at least 20 DE genes identified, multi-pathway genes that were involved in 10 or more pathways and exclusively-expressed genes that were included in one system. Overall, our present study reported a large set of DE genes, compiled a comprehensive coverage of pathways, and revealed system-based reactomes of PAMs infected with PRRSV. We believe that our reactome data provides new insight into molecular mechanisms involved in host genetic complexity of antiviral activities against PRRSV and lays a strong foundation for vaccine development to control PRRS incidence in pigs.","publish_time":"2013-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Zhihua; Zhou, Xiang; Michal, Jennifer J.; Wu, Xiao-Lin; Zhang, Lifan; Zhang, Ming; Ding, Bo; Liu, Bang; Manoranjan, Valipuram S.; Neill, John D.; Harhay, Gregory P.; Kehrli, Marcus E.; Miller, Laura C.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab5652086c345dbe360ca35b48b31e43f95507e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3602036.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23527143/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0059229","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Differentially","DAVID"],"organizations":["DE","PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV infection","reactome analysis","multi-pathway genes","immune system","dominant pathways","revealed system-based reactomes of PAMs","hours PRRSV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages","genetic information processing","major reactomes of PAMs","serial analysis of gene expression","organismal systems","biological systems","comprehensive coverage of pathways","present study","sequenced tags","REACTOME databases","unique tags","KEGG","environmental information processing","hour mock-infected","energy metabolism","transcription processes","infectious diseases","cellular processes","human diseases","PRRS incidence","expression trends","functional category","functional categories","pig industries","host genetic complexity of antiviral activities","molecular mechanisms","signal transductions","mRNA assignment","death","cell growth","arbitrary selection","libraries","SAGE","vaccine development","new insight","manual annotation","strong foundation","respiratory syndrome","Self-organizing map","SOM","Bayesian framework","large set","time points","pigs","small RNA virus","DAVID","number","clusters","years","investigation","modification","monocytes"],"language":"en"},

Data on how COVID-19 is affecting immunocompromised patients are however few. With our study we aimed to systematically review the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 cases in children and adults with immunosuppression, to evaluate outcomes in this special population. METHODS: A systematic review of literature was carried out to identify relevant articles, searching the EMBASE, Medline, and Google Scholar databases. Studies reporting data on pre-defined outcomes and related to immunosuppressed adults and children with SARS-CoV-2 were included. RESULTS: Sixteen relevant articles were identified with 110 immunosuppressed patients, mostly presenting cancer, along with transplantation and immunodeficiency. Cancer was more often associated with a more severe course, but not necessarily with a bad prognosis. Our data show that both children and adults with immunosuppression seem to have a favorable disease course, as compared to the general population. CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressed patients with COVID-19 seem to be few in relation to the overall figures, and to present a favorable outcome as compared to other comorbidities. This might be explained by a hypothetical protective role of a weaker immune response, determining a milder disease presentation and thus underdiagnosis. Nevertheless, surveillance on this special population should be encouraged.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Minotti, Chiara; Tirelli, Francesca; Barbieri, Elisa; Giaquinto, Carlo; Don\u00E0, Daniele","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5b2b16606248c9c9640dda13d0c0b1dfe56e37b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179496.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320302371?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320302371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335173/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs1ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunosuppressed adults","immunosuppressed patients","SARS-CoV","children","special population","immunosuppression","relevant articles","favorable disease course","COVID","immunocompromised patients","general population","presenting cancer","favorable outcome","severe course","pre-defined outcomes","milder disease presentation","systematic review of literature","weaker immune response","Medline","EMBASE","hypothetical protective role","cases","Studies","infection","Google Scholar databases","METHODS","transplantation","underdiagnosis","current knowledge","CONCLUSION","overall figures","relation","global resonance","comorbidities","immunodeficiency","RESULTS","surveillance","OBJECTIVES","bad prognosis","study"],"language":"en"},

Our previous study demonstrated that nsp1 induces RNA modification near the 5\u2032-end of a reporter mRNA having a short 5\u2032 untranslated region and RNA cleavage in the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) region of a dicistronic RNA template, but not in those IRES elements from hepatitis C or cricket paralysis viruses. By using primarily cell-free, in vitro translation systems, the present study revealed that the nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage mainly near the 5\u2032 untranslated region of capped mRNA templates. Experiments using dicistronic mRNAs carrying different IRESes showed that nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage within the ribosome loading region of type I and type II picornavirus IRES elements, but not that of classical swine fever virus IRES, which is characterized as a hepatitis C virus-like IRES. The nsp1-induced RNA cleavage of template mRNAs exhibited no apparent preference for a specific nucleotide sequence at the RNA cleavage sites. Remarkably, SCoV mRNAs, which have a 5\u2032 cap structure and 3\u2032 poly A tail like those of typical host mRNAs, were not susceptible to nsp1-mediated RNA cleavage and importantly, the presence of the 5\u2032-end leader sequence protected the SCoV mRNAs from nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage.

CPV has an evolutionary rate nearest to those of RNA viruses, with consequences on disease diagnosis and epidemiology. This paper reports the molecular characterization of eight CPV-2a strains collected from dogs in Italy in 2016\u20132017. Genetic analysis was conducted on a CPV genomic region encompassing both open reading frames (ORFs) encoding for nonstructural (NS1-NS2) and structural proteins (VP1-VP2). Sequence analysis indicates new and unreported sequence changes, mainly affecting the VP2 gene, which included the mutation Tyr324Leu.

METHODS: Multiplex reverse-transcription PCR was performed for the detection of viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirat. Disease severity was grouped using a categorization index as very mild/mild, and moderate/severe. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of hospitalized children with viral respiratory tract infection were analyzed. RESULTS: Viral pathogens were detected in 103/155 (66.5%) of patients. In order of frequency, identified pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (32.0%), adenovirus (26.2%), parainfluenza viruses type 1\u20134 (19.4%), rhinovirus (18.4%), influenza A and B (12.6%), human metapneumovirus (12.6%), coronavirus (2.9%), and bocavirus (0.9%). Coinfections were present in 21 samples. Most of the children had very mild (38.8%) and mild disease (37.9%). Severity of illness was not worse with coinfections. The most common discharge diagnoses were \u0022URTI\u0022 with or without LRTI/asthma (n=58). Most viruses exhibited strong seasonal patterns. Leukocytosis (22.2%) and neutrophilia (36.6%) were most commonly detected in patients with adenovirus and rhinovirus (p\u003C0.05).

Three independent sets of data exemplify the two kinds of memory in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The data provide evidence of re-emergence of sequences that were hidden in cellular or anatomical compartments for extended periods of infection, and recovery of a quasispecies from pre-existing genomes. We develop a three-component model that incorporates the essential features of the quasispecies dynamics of retroviruses exposed to selective pressures. Significantly, a numerical study based on this model is in agreement with the experimental data, further supporting the existence of both replicative and reservoir memory in retroviral quasispecies.","publish_time":"2003-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Briones, Carlos; Domingo, Esteban; Molina-Par\u0131\u0301s, Carmen","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8e9b9460d245145a00ceb2f8f6b1a49dbd2123e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173031.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283603006612; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603006612","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replicative memory","retroviral quasispecies","molecular memory","kinds of memory","reservoir memory","quasispecies dynamics of retroviruses","Abstract Viral quasispecies","experimental data","theoretical model","anatomical compartments","component model","experimental evidence","independent sets of data","body compartments","evidence of re-emergence","presence of viral reservoirs","recovery","extended periods of infection","human immunodeficiency virus type","past evolutionary history","minority components","essential features","integrative cycle","existence","HIV","sequences","selective pressures","mutant spectrum","pre-existing genomes","agreement","numerical study"],"language":"en"},

Few studies have examined respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in adults. We assessed the characteristics and outcomes of RSV relative to other viral infections. Methods. Patients \u226550 years old with acute respiratory illness were recruited for studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness from 2004 through 2010. Nasopharyngeal swabs from enrollees were analyzed for the presence of RSV and other respiratory viruses by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were obtained from interview and medical records. Results. A total of 2225 samples were tested across all seasons. The mean age was 64.2 (SD, 10.7) years; the mean interval from illness onset to sample collection was 4 (SD, 2.2) days. One or more viruses were detected in 1202 (54%) participants. In a multivariable logistic regression model, RSV was associated with ages 65\u201379 years (vs 50\u201364 years), symptoms of cough, nasal congestion and wheezing, and longer interval from illness onset to clinical encounter. RSV was not associated with the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure in univariate analyses. Hospital admission within 30 days after illness onset was less common among patients with RSV compared to those with influenza (unadjusted odds ratio = 0.54 [95% confidence interval, .29\u20131.01], P = .06). Conclusions. RSV is a common cause of acute respiratory illness in adults aged \u226550 years; the risk of infection increases with age.

A characteristic feature of IBV is the occurrence of many different strains belonging to different serotypes, which renders complete control of the disease by vaccination a challenging task due to the poor cross-protection between different serotypes. In this study, based on the results of S1 sequence analysis and virus cross-neutralization tests, IBV strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 was found to be genetically and antigenically different from other known IBV types, representing not only a novel genotype, but also a novel serotype (designated as GI-28). Viruses belonging to this novel serotype have been isolated from several regions in China in recent years, suggesting endemic circulation of the serotype in various geographic locations in China. Further studies by complete genomic analysis showed that strain ck/CH/LGX/111119 may have originated from recombination events involving LX4 genotype IBVs and an as-yet-unidentified IBV donating a S1 gene, or from the result of accumulation of mutations and selections, especially in the S1 gene, from a LX4 genotype virus. ck/CH/LGX/111119 is a nephropathogenic strain, although it had broader tissue tropism (respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts) among chickens challenged at one day old. Infection of the oviducts with ck/CH/LGX/111119 found in this study may have severe implications because the virus will likely induce the occurrence of false layers.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yuqiu; Jiang, Lei; Zhao, Wenjun; Liu, Liangliang; Zhao, Yan; Shao, Yuhao; Li, Huixin; Han, Zongxi; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6970df5eee622e854847bddc7fbb313c098b9f37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117283.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516303960; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516303960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28062000/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.12.017","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["IBV strain ck","LGX","unidentified IBV","different serotypes","novel serotype","novel genotype","LX4 genotype virus","S1 gene","different strains","known IBV types","characteristic feature of IBV","nephropathogenic strain","China","LX4 genotype IBVs","study","virus cross-neutralization tests","results of S1 sequence analysis","complete genomic analysis","complete control","poor cross-protection","occurrence of false layers","digestive","endemic circulation","broader tissue tropism","Abstract Avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus","recent years","disease","vaccination","challenging task","selections","various geographic locations","chickens","reproductive tracts","result of accumulation","regions","recombination events","oviducts","major poultry pathogen","mutations","studies","severe implications","day old","Infection","Viruses"],"language":"en"},

The COVID-19 outbreak \u201Ccreates a sense of d\u00E9j\u00E0 vu\u201D with the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).3 Citing early estimates of the disease\u0027s infectiousness, based on an analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan,4 comparisons have been drawn with the 1918\u201319 influenza pandemic.5 Although in some respects the outbreak of COVID-19 presents a compelling argument for why history matters, there are problems with analogical views of the past because they constrain our ability to grasp the complex place-and-time-specific variables that drive contemporary disease emergence. A lessons approach to epidemics produces what Kenneth Burke, borrowing from the economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen, called \u201Ctrained incapacity\u201D\u2014\u201Cthat state of affairs whereby one\u0027s very abilities can function as blindnesses\u201D.6 Habitual modes of thinking can diminish our capacity to make lateral connections. When the present is viewed through the lens of former disease outbreaks, we typically focus on similitudes and overlook important differences. In other words, analogies create blind spots. As Burke commented, \u201Ca way of seeing is also a way of not seeing\u2014a focus on object A involves a neglect of object B\u201D.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peckham, Robert","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b44dccbac47487f2ea8ad86f376c9ae0f366dd4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124555.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32135077/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30468-2; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620304682; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673620304682","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQzLmNzdjs4Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1681964,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IxFdVdjEm9xt8HlDmFHjcQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_43.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kenneth Burke","Burke","Thorstein Veblen"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hubei"],"keyphrases":["outbreak of COVID","outbreak of coronavirus disease","past lessons","disease outbreaks","future disease preparedness","contemporary disease emergence","epidemics","history matters","lessons approach pivots","value of history","past assist","way","focus","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","new cases","confirmed cases","Kenneth Burke","complex place","influenza pandemic","neglect of object B","SARS","assumption","time-specific variables","economist","ongoing epidemic","problems","sociologist Thorstein Veblen","China\u0027s Hubei province","trained incapacity","early estimates","blindnesses","disease\u0027s infectiousness","analysis","real-time management","prevention","compelling argument","Habitual modes of thinking","analogical views","explicit accusation","similitudes","words","analogies","blind spots","abilities","state of affairs","Wuhan","comparisons","comparable events","historians","lens","ability","respects","important differences","interrogatives","lateral connections","pressure","crisis","policy","commentaries","background","present","insights","sense of"],"language":"en"},

The disease surveillance and quality control are essential to guarantee the results of animal experiments performed on rabbits. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, rabbit rotavirus and Sendai virus are the important pathogens that needed to be eliminated. Rapid and sensitive method focus on these three viruses should be established for routine monitoring. The Luminex x-TAG assay based on multiplex PCR and fluorescent microsphere is a fast developing technology applied in high throughput detection. Specific primers modified with oligonucleotide sequence/biotin were used to amplify target fragments. The conjugation between oligonucleotide sequence of the PCR products and the MagPlex-TAG microspheres was specific without any cross-reaction, and the hybridization products could be analyzed using the Luminex 200 analyzer instrument. Recombinant plasmids were constructed to estimate the detection limit of the viruses. Furthermore, 40 clinical samples were used to evaluate the efficiency of this multiplex PCR based Luminex x-TAG assay. RESULTS: According to the results, this new method showed high specificity and good stability. Assessed by the recombinant plasmids, the detection limit of three viruses was 100copies/\u03BCl. Among 40 clinical specimens, 18 specimens were found positive, which was completely concordant with the conventional PCR method.

ISF and solutes drain from the brain parenchyma to cervical lymph nodes by a separate route along 100\u2013150 nm wide basement membranes in the walls of cerebral capillaries and arteries.

We unraveled a directly antiviral function for the gene SERPINE1, encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). By targeting extracellular airway proteases, PAI-1 inhibits IAV glycoprotein cleavage, thereby reducing infectivity of progeny viruses. This was biologically relevant for IAV restriction in vivo. Further, partial PAI-1 deficiency, attributable to a polymorphism in human SERPINE1, conferred increased susceptibility to IAV in vitro.

Since December 2010, a large-scale outbreak of diarrhea has been observed in swine farms in China. Accumulated evidence indicates that this large-scale outbreak of diarrhea were caused by highly virulent PEDV variants. METHODS: A PEDV strain, YC2014, was isolated from intestinal samples of suckling piglets with acute diarrhea in 2014. The complete genomic sequence of YC2014 and the nucleotide sequence of S gene were aligned with sequences of published isolates using MEGA 5.1 software. The immune protective efficiency of YC2014 were determined by testing PEDV neutralizing antibodies in sera, the colostrum and the milk on 7th day after farrowing of the immunized sows. The diarrhea symptoms of piglets after challenge were also observed. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomic sequence of YC2014 and the nucleotide sequence of S gene demonstrated that the YC2014 PEDV strain was clustered with the PEDV epidemic strains, with \u003E99 % nucleotide identity to these PEDV strains. The S gene sequence of YC2014 shared only 93.9 % ~ 94.4 % identities with classical CV777, DR13 and JS2008 strains, with 15 nucleotide insertion in three sites and three nucleotide deletion in one site. The amino acid (AA) sequence of S gene of YC2014 shared only 92.8 % ~ 93.4 % identities with classical CV777, DR13 and JS2008 strains, with 5 AA insertion in two sites and 1 AA deletion in one site. In the immune protective efficiency tests, the neutralizing antibody titers in sera, the colostrum and the milk on 7th day after farrowing of the inactivated YC2014 PEDV strain immunized group were significantly higher than the inactivated CV777 immunized group and the inactivated DR13 immunized group (P \u003C 0.05). The traditional inactivated PEDV vaccines made from CV777 or DR13 could not protect piglets from YC2014 challenge, while inactivated YC2014 could provide piglets with 100 % protection against YC2014 challenge. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that, great antigenicity variation had occurred to this YC2014 PEDV strain. The YC2014 PEDV strain could provide piglets against homologous challenge. It is critical for future pathogenic and antigenic studies, as well as for the development of effective preventive and control vaccines against PEDV.","publish_time":"2016-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Huixing; Chen, Lei; Gao, Lu; Yuan, Xiaomin; Ma, Zhe; Fan, Hongjie","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c5447c495379f968aacd114e73a03039ccfd69d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4840883.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27103490/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0529-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MEGA","PEDV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["inactivated YC2014 PEDV","YC2014 PEDV strain","YC2014 challenge","PEDV strains","S gene sequence of YC2014","sequence of S gene of YC2014","testing PEDV","PEDV epidemic strains","complete genomic sequence of YC2014","traditional inactivated PEDV vaccines","nucleotide sequence of S gene","immune protective efficiency of YC2014","virulent PEDV variants","inactivated CV777 immunized group","inactivated DR13 immunized group","diarrhea symptoms of piglets","nucleotide insertion","acute diarrhea","nucleotide deletion","large-scale outbreak of diarrhea","classical CV777","JS2008 strains","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","nucleotide identity","AA insertion","immunized sows","AA deletion","homologous challenge","main causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea","sera","intestinal samples of suckling piglets","colostrum","day","sites","RESULTS","milk","identities","immune protective efficiency tests","control vaccines","neutralizing antibody titers","Phylogenetic analysis","sequences of published isolates","development of effective preventive","antigenic studies","great antigenicity variation","BACKGROUND","antibodies","amino acid","software","Accumulated evidence","swine farms","protection","METHODS","China","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

LBW newborns are at greater risk to acquire recurrent bacterial and viral infections during their first few weeks of life possibly as an outcome of compromised innate immune functions. As adaptive immunity is in a naive state, increased risk of infection of LBW as compared to NBW newborns may reflect impairments in innate immunity. METHODOLOGY: To characterize the increased susceptibility to infections in LBW newborns we used microarray technology to identify differences in gene expression in LBW newborns (n = 8) compared to NBW newborns (n = 4) using cord blood. The results obtained from the microarray study were validated on a larger number of samples using real time RT-PCR (LBW = 22, NBW = 18) and western blotting (LBW = 12, NBW = 12). The Interferome database was used to identify interferon (IFN) signature genes and ingenuity pathway analysis identified canonical pathways and biological functions associated with the differentially expressed genes in LBW newborns. ELISAs for IFNs and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein were performed in both LBW and NBW newborns and in adults (LBW = 18, NBW = 18, Adults = 8). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Upon microarray analysis, we identified 1,391 differentially expressed genes, of which, 1,065 genes were down-regulated and 326 genes were up-regulated in the LBW compared to NBW newborns. Of note, 70 IFN-signature genes were found to be significantly down-regulated in LBW compared to NBW newborns. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed pattern recognition receptors signaling including Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) -1, -5, and -8 genes and IFN signaling as the most significantly impacted pathways. Respiratory infectious diseases were the most significantly affected bio-functions in LBW newborns. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Diminished PRRs, IFN-signature, and BPI gene expression raises the possibility that impairments in these pathways contribute to the susceptibility of LBW term infants to infection.","publish_time":"2013-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Vikas Vikram; Chauhan, Sudhir Kumar; Rai, Richa; Kumar, Ashok; Singh, Shiva M.; Rai, Geeta","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76d39ac4634db5a0fcc8cddbefd965c463c0ace0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3633842.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23626859/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062845","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NBW","Toll-Like Receptors","BPI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LBW newborns","NBW newborns","susceptibility of LBW term infants","IFN-signature genes","microarray analysis","ingenuity pathway analysis","increased risk of infection","increased susceptibility","microarray technology","canonical pathways","biological functions","microarray study","bio-functions","impairments","innate immunity","impacted pathways","adults","normal birth weight","BPI gene expression","mortality rates of low birth weight","outcome of compromised innate immune functions","greater risk","viral infections","adaptive immunity","pattern recognition receptors","real time RT-PCR","larger number of samples","naive state","differences","Toll","Morbidity","Diminished PRRs","possibility","interferon","permeability","SIGNIFICANCE","weeks of life","western blotting","ELISAs","IFNs","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","protein","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","note","Respiratory infectious diseases","Interferome database","cord blood","TLRs","results","METHODOLOGY"],"language":"en"},

In women affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the case fatality rate appears higher in those affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid review to guide health policy and management of women affected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, which was used to develop the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\u0027 (RCOG) guidelines on COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. METHODS: Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies and randomized controlled trials describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy. Data were extracted from relevant papers. This review has been used to develop guidelines with representatives of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) and RCOG who provided expert consensus on areas in which data were lacking. RESULTS: From 9965 search results in PubMed and 600 in MedRxiv, 21 relevant studies, all of which were case reports or case series, were identified. From reports of 32 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 30 babies (one set of twins, three ongoing pregnancies), seven (22%) were asymptomatic and two (6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), one of whom remained on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. No maternal deaths have been reported to date. Delivery was by Cesarean section in 27 cases and by vaginal delivery in two, and 15 (47%) delivered preterm. There was one stillbirth and one neonatal death. In 25 babies, no cases of vertical transmission were reported; 15 were reported as being tested with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after delivery. Case fatality rates for SARS and MERS were 15% and 27%, respectively. SARS was associated with miscarriage or intrauterine death in five cases, and fetal growth restriction was noted in two ongoing pregnancies affected by SARS in the third trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Serious morbidity occurred in 2/32 women with COVID-19, both of whom required ICU care. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 appears less lethal, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date and that one woman remains in a critical condition. Preterm delivery affected 47% of women hospitalized with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK\u0027s reasonable worst-case scenario of 80% of the population being affected is realized. Based on this review, RCOG, in consultation with RCPCH, developed guidance for delivery and neonatal care in pregnancies affected by COVID-19, which recommends that delivery mode be determined primarily by obstetric indication and recommends against routine separation of affected mothers and their babies. We hope that this review will be helpful for maternity and neonatal services planning their response to COVID-19. \u00A9 2020 The Authors.

Using this resource, we showed that genetic variations in SARS- CoV-2, though still few for the moment, already follow the pattern of mutations in related coronaviruses, and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus. Importantly, we discovered evidence that SARS-CoV-2, along with related coronaviruses, used mutations to evade attack from the human immune system.

Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus5,6. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 virus Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 \u03BCM. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.","publish_time":"2020-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Zhenming; Du, Xiaoyu; Xu, Yechun; Deng, Yongqiang; Liu, Meiqin; Zhao, Yao; Zhang, Bing; Li, Xiaofeng; Zhang, Leike; Peng, Chao; Duan, Yinkai; Yu, Jing; Wang, Lin; Yang, Kailin; Liu, Fengjiang; Jiang, Rendi; Yang, Xinglou; You, Tian; Liu, Xiaoce; Yang, Xiuna; Bai, Fang; Liu, Hong; Liu, Xiang; Guddat, Luke W.; Xu, Wenqing; Xiao, Gengfu; Qin, Chengfeng; Shi, Zhengli; Jiang, Hualiang; Rao, Zihe; Yang, Haitao","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/313dd0869f169624e78d770963eacb0d1641cafa.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b8edb3418574ffc5f01506de64c503c48d44c783.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.964882","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virtual drug screening","drug candidates","new drug leads","virus Mpro","attractive drug target","inhibitors of Mpro","computer-aided drug design","rapid discovery of drug leads","high-throughput screening","screening strategy","lead compounds","crystal structure of COVID","clinical potential","clinical trials","clinical use","active compounds","new coronavirus","combination of structure","new infectious diseases","virus main protease","program of combined structure","cell-based assays","mechanism-based inhibitor","specific drugs","approved drugs","viral replication","key CoV enzyme","viral pneumonia outbreak","response","N3","promising antiviral activity","effective treatment options","pivotal role","transcription","targeted therapeutics","vaccines","complex","etiological agent responsible","Ebselen","Wuhan1","efficacy","virus5","IC50 values","results","order","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

The internal control primers and probe target a region in the coat protein gene of the E. coli F-specific bacteriophage ms2, which is contained within the aRNA.","publish_time":"2008-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stevenson, Jeffery; Hymas, Weston; Hillyard, David","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71bc4d360eae554dbd3d6f9161cc7e98208de69f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119664.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093408000682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18395804/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.02.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093408000682","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["real time RT-PCR assay","Real time reverse transcriptase-PCR","internal control primers","respiratory samples","viral target","aRNA","detection of viral pathogens","significant challenges","sample type","region","coli F-specific bacteriophage ms2","coat protein gene","probe","Armored RNA","inefficient extraction","accurate patient testing","SARS-associated Coronavirus","report","study","potential inhibition","goal"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to delineate and compare the immunologic features of severe and moderate COVID-19. METHODS In this retrospective study, the clinical and immunologic characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the Guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China. RESULTS The median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough and fatigue. Compared to moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03B1. Absolute number of T lymphocytes, CD4\u002BT and CD8\u002BT cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5 and 89.0 \u00D7 106/L) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5 and 254.0 \u00D7 106/L). The expressions of IFN-\u03B3 by CD4\u002BT cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than moderate cases (22.8%). CONCLUSION The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes particularly CD4\u002BT and CD8\u002B T cells, resulting in decrease in numbers as well as IFN-\u03B3 production. These potential immunological markers may be of importance due to their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Guang; Wu, Di; Guo, Wei; Cao, Yong; Huang, Da; Wang, Hongwu; Wang, Tao; Zhang, Xiaoyun; Chen, Huilong; Yu, Haijing; Zhang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Minxia; Wu, Shiji; Song, Jianxin; Chen, Tao; Han, Meifang; Li, Shusheng; Luo, Xiaoping; Zhao, Jianping; Ning, Qin","journal":"The Journal of clinical investigation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1172/jci137244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32217835/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsxNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe cases","moderate cases","T cells","moderate COVID","immunologic features of severe","CD4","median age of severe","patients","Absolute number of T lymphocytes","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","higher levels of IL","CD8","SARS-CoV","outbreak of Coronavirus Disease","IFN-\u03B3 production","higher levels of alanine aminotransferase","immunologic characteristics","expressions of IFN","disease severity","Common clinical manifestations","lactate dehydrogenase","C-reactive protein","ferritin","importance","fever","cough","hypoalbuminemia","D-dimer","retrospective study","Guidelines","correlation","numbers","lymphopenia","decrease","dyspnea","National Health Commission of China","infection","potential immunological markers","fatigue","female","METHODS","CONCLUSION","years","TNF-\u03B1","global threat","BACKGROUND","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

There are 33 peptidase families common to archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes and are assumed to have originated in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). These include peptidases with different catalytic types, exo- and endopeptidases, peptidases with different tertiary structures and peptidases from different families but with similar structures. This implies that the different catalytic types and structures pre-date LUCA. Other families have had their origins in the ancestors of viruses, archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, and a number of families have had their origins in the ancestors of particular phyla.

Despite this, only 6% of all CoV sequences in GenBank are from bats. The remaining 94% largely consist of known pathogens of public health or agricultural significance, indicating that current research effort is heavily biased towards describing known diseases rather than the \u2018pre-emergent\u2019 diversity in bats. Our study addresses this critical gap, and focuses on resource poor countries where the risk of zoonotic emergence is believed to be highest. We surveyed the diversity of CoVs in multiple host taxa from twenty countries to explore the factors driving viral diversity at a global scale. We identified sequences representing 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats, and used ecological and epidemiologic analyses to show that patterns of CoV diversity correlate with those of bat diversity. This cements bats as the major evolutionary reservoirs and ecological drivers of CoV diversity. Co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis was also used to show that host switching has contributed to CoV evolution, and a preliminary analysis suggests that regional variation exists in the dynamics of this process. Overall our study represents a model for exploring global viral diversity and advances our fundamental understanding of CoV biodiversity and the potential risk factors associated with zoonotic emergence.","publish_time":"2017-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anthony, Simon J.; Johnson, Christine K.; Greig, Denise J.; Kramer, Sarah; Che, Xiaoyu; Wells, Heather; Hicks, Allison L.; Joly, Damien O.; Wolfe, Nathan D.; Daszak, Peter; Karesh, William; Lipkin, W.

Systems biology approaches promise to shed new light on the regulation of innate immunity through the analysis and modelling of these networks. A key initial step in this process is the contextual cataloguing of the components of this system and the molecular interactions that comprise these networks. InnateDB (http://www.innatedb.com) is a molecular interaction and pathway database developed to facilitate systems-level analyses of innate immunity. RESULTS: Here, we describe the InnateDB curation project, which is manually annotating the human and mouse innate immunity interactome in rich contextual detail, and present our novel curation software system, which has been developed to ensure interactions are curated in a highly accurate and data-standards compliant manner. To date, over 13,000 interactions (protein, DNA and RNA) have been curated from the biomedical literature. Here, we present data, illustrating how InnateDB curation of the innate immunity interactome has greatly enhanced network and pathway annotation available for systems-level analysis and discuss the challenges that face such curation efforts. Significantly, we provide several lines of evidence that analysis of the innate immunity interactome has the potential to identify novel signalling, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of innate immunity. Additionally, these analyses also provide insight into the cross-talk between innate immunity pathways and other biological processes, such as adaptive immunity, cancer and diabetes, and intriguingly, suggests links to other pathways, which as yet, have not been implicated in the innate immune response. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, curation of the InnateDB interactome provides a wealth of information to enable systems-level analysis of innate immunity.","publish_time":"2010-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lynn, David J; Chan, Calvin; Naseer, Misbah; Yau, Melissa; Lo, Raymond; Sribnaia, Anastasia; Ring, Giselle; Que, Jaimmie; Wee, Kathleen; Winsor, Geoffrey L; Laird, Matthew R; Breuer, Karin; Foroushani, Amir K; Brinkman, Fiona SL; Hancock, Robert EW","journal":"BMC Syst Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1d31bf64148c3dabdd5b8a288b78c0c6d3a7cea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2936296.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-4-117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727158/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["innate immunity pathways","regulation of innate immunity","mouse innate immunity interactome","systems-level analysis of innate immunity","systems-level analyses of innate immunity","adaptive immunity","post-transcriptional regulators of innate immunity","innate immune response","InnateDB interactome","InnateDB curation project","transcriptional networks","curation efforts","novel curation software system","molecular interactions","novel signalling","Systems biology approaches","present data","pathway database","complex signalling","contextual cataloguing","pathway annotation available","data-standards compliant manner","enhanced network","new light","biological processes","potential","line of defence","cross","wealth of information","invading pathogens","protein","diabetes","components","challenges","summary","human","modelling","key initial step","DNA","RNA","cancer","lines of evidence","BACKGROUND","links","insight","date","CONCLUSIONS","biomedical literature","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

It has evolved various strategies to counteract the production and action of type I interferons, which mobilize the front-line defense against viral infection. In this study we demonstrate that SARS coronavirus M protein inhibits gene transcription of type I interferons. M protein potently antagonizes the activation of interferon-stimulated response element-dependent transcription by double-stranded RNA, RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, IKK\u03F5, and virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA) but has no influence on the transcriptional activity of this element when IRF3 or IRF7 is overexpressed. M protein physically associates with RIG-I, TBK1, IKK\u03F5, and TRAF3 and likely sequesters some of them in membrane-associated cytoplasmic compartments. Consequently, the expression of M protein prevents the formation of TRAF3\u00B7TANK\u00B7TBK1/IKK\u03F5 complex and thereby inhibits TBK1/IKK\u03F5-dependent activation of IRF3/IRF7 transcription factors.

This procedure is laborious and poses LN2 related hazards. An alternative logistics for transportation of samples was investigated. Use of Flinders Technology Associates (FTA\u00AE) elute card was evaluated for transportation of extended bovine semen to screen BoHV-1 DNA by real-time PCR targeting gB gene and the method was compared with the OIE approved Chelex resin based method. A protocol for extraction of BoHV-1 DNA from FTA\u00AE card spotted with extended semen was optimized. The viral DNA was found to be stable on FTA\u00AE card for at least 28 days when the cards are stored at 4\u00B0\u201337 \u00B0C. The analytical sensitivity for the assay was determined using variable dilutions of BoHV-1 spiked semen and positive plasmid harbouring gB gene (97bp) spotted onto FTA\u00AE card and it was found to be 100.8 TCID50/ml or 100 copies respectively in real-time PCR. The test could detect as low as 100.008 TCID50/ml or 1 copy of positive plasmid when more number of replicates (n = 6) of the same sample were tested. This sensitivity was found to be comparable to Chelex method and both the methods demonstrated a very strong correlation (r = 0.9774; 95% CI: 0.9620\u20130.9860) in terms of Ct value (p \u003C 0.0001). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the FTA method in comparison to the Chelex method was 83.08% (95% CI: 71.73%\u201391.24%) and 93.23% (95% CI: 89.38%\u201396.01%) respectively when 316 samples were screened by both the methods.

To our knowledge, no prior study has analyzed a CDC Twitter handle\u2019s entire contents and all followers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the contents and followers of the Twitter profile @CDC_AMD and to assess if attaching photos or videos to tweets posted by @CDC_AMD would increase retweet frequency. METHODS: Data of @CDC_AMD were retrieved on November 21, 2016. All followers (N=809) were manually categorized. All tweets (N=768) were manually coded for contents and whether photos or videos were attached. Retweet count for each tweet was recorded. Negative binomial regression models were applied to both the original and the retweet corpora. RESULTS: Among the 809 followers, 26.0% (210/809) were individual health professionals, 11.6% (94/809) nongovernmental organizations, 3.3% (27/809) government agencies\u2019 accounts, 3.3% (27/809) accounts of media organizations and journalists, and 0.9% (7/809) academic journals, with 54.9% (444/809) categorized as miscellaneous. A total of 46.9% (360/768) of @CDC_AMD\u2019s tweets referred to the Office\u2019s website and their current research; 17.6% (135/768) referred to their scientists\u2019 publications. Moreover, 80% (69/86) of tweets retweeted by @CDC_AMD fell into the miscellaneous category. In addition, 43.4% (333/768) of the tweets contained photos or videos, whereas the remaining 56.6% (435/768) did not. Attaching photos or videos to original @CDC_AMD tweets increases the number of retweets by 37% (probability ratio=1.37, 95% CI 1.13-1.67, P=.002).

However, studying TGEV infection within the complexity of the porcine intestinal epithelium reveals difficulties due to limiting infection models. Here we established a new ex vivo model to analyze the enterotropism of TGEV in porcine intestinal tissue. Precision cut intestinal slices (PCIS) were produced and ATP level was measured to proof vitality of the slices. ATP measurements and HE staining revealed living tissue in culture for up to 24h. PCIS were infected with three different TGEV strains. TGEV PUR 46-MAD is a commonly used TGEV strain that is known to be attenuated. TGEV Miller was passaged in piglets several times to reveal high infection. Finally, TGEV GFP is a recombinant strain that obtained its main body from TGEV PUR 46-MAD, but its spike protein from TGEV PUR-C11 that showed high mortality in piglets in vivo. Our results were in complete consensus of these statements. TGEV Miller mildly and TGEV GFP extensively infected the cells in the jejunum based on the amount of positive stained epithelial cells. However, for TGEV PUR 46-MAD no nucleocapsid protein was detected in the epithelial cells of the tissue.

Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to transport farther in the air, making the current social distancing policy insufficient. To provide evidence and insight into the \u201Csocial distancing\u201D guidelines, a validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000 \u03BCm, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16 km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze. The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%. The distances between the two virtual humans are 1.83 m and 3.05 m (6 feet and 10 feet). The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. Numerical results indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05 m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people. High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can be transported from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 s. Thus, due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 6 feet needs to be considered. Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Yu; Marchal, Thierry; Sperry, Ted; Yi, Hang","journal":"Journal of aerosol science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31405dd697c54599864408c6cae1725043d5acd8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220300744?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427227/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850220300744","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ambient wind","wind convection","feet social distancing policy","complex environmental wind","wind velocities range","different environmental wind velocities","different wind forces","social distance","cough droplets","laden droplets","virtual humans","steady-state wind","infected human coughs","healthy humans","current social distancing policy insufficient","RH conditions","calm air","air circulation","human bodies","Ambient RHs","suspending micro-droplets","airborne transmission","deposition of SARS","SARS-CoV","droplet sizes","High RH","airborne cough droplet numbers","sneezes","transient transport","Microdroplets","complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions","Initial droplet diameters","deposition fractions","convection effects","nearby people","separation distance","coronavirus disease","hygroscopic growth effect","facial covering effect","inter-person aerosol transmission","validated computational fluid-particle dynamics","potential health risk","CFPD","gust","recirculation","evaporation","complexity","guidelines","moderate breeze","relative humidity","model","condensation","\u03BCm","secondary flows","head regions","comparison","insight","Numerical results","spread","constant frequency","COVID","airflow","assumption","ground","evidence","distances","rest","masks"],"language":"en"},

In 133 (53.8%) patients a viral infection was identified and in 34 (13.8%) a bacterial pathogen was isolated from cultures. In 18 (7.3%) patients a double infection (bacterial\u002Bviral) was identified. In group B, the presence of cardiac failure (46.6% vs 28.3%, p\u003C0.001), renal failure (10.5% vs 4%, p=0.03), bacterial co-infection (13.8% vs 7.4%, p=0.04), influenza vaccination rates (45.5% vs 215, p\u003C0.001), and longer hospital stay (8.4\u00B14.4 vs 7.5\u00B13.2 days, p=0.02) were higher than group A. The overall rate of viral infections did not differ according to age. A trend to higher rates of infection with parainfluenza 3 [19 (20%) patients in group B vs3 (7.5%) patients in group A, p=0.04] was observed in older patients. CONCLUSION : No differences on the rate and type of viral infections were noted for elderly vs non elderly patients. However, they tended to have more bacterial co-infections that led to AECOPD and longer hospitalization stays compared to non-elderly patients.","publish_time":"2015-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dimopoulos, G; Tsiodras, S; Lerikou, M; Chranioti, Aik; Perros, E; Anagnostopoulou, U; Karakitsos, P; Armaganidis, A","journal":"Open Respir Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89f214be6e76049510daa238a9182f8302cfdbbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4347051.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25741393/; https://doi.org/10.2174/1874306401509010001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

We investigated the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in 21 consecutive patients with clinically definite MS to produce interferons and lymphokines in response to viral or mitogenic stimulation. Ten patients showed clinical signs of disease activity (acute relapse) and 11 patients were in a stable condition. Additionally, white blood count, leukocyte differentiation and lymphocyte subtyping were performed. A group of age-related healthy blood donors served as control (n=20). There was no difference between patients and controls in the production of IFN-\u03B3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1 and soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor. IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B2 responsiveness, however, was significantly lower in patients with stable disease than in patients with active disease and controls (p\u003C0.001). Furthermore, secretion of IL-2 after stimulation was significantly diminished in both patient groups as compared to the control group (p\u003C0.01). Analysis of T-cell subsets revealed a significantly lower amount of CD8\u002B T-cells in patients with stable disease, leading to a significantly higher CD4/CD8 ratio in this group as compared to patients with active disease. Our study depicted an IL-2 deficiency in MS patients which is shared with other autoimmune diseases. In addition, our findings suggest that the ability to produce type-I IFNs, IFN-\u03B1 and IFN-\u03B2, is primarily impaired in MS patients and changes in correlation to the course of disease activity.","publish_time":"1997-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wandinger, Klaus-Peter; Wessel, Karl; Neustock, Petra; Siekhaus, Aja; Kirchner, Holger","journal":"Journal of the Neurological Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44221b95d7931c51f83060d114e9c7fb43007971.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127026.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X97053835; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022510X97053835","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MS patients","consecutive patients","IFN-\u03B1","stable disease","active disease","production of IFN","IFN-\u03B2 responsiveness","course of disease activity","definite MS","clinical signs of disease activity","control group","T-cells","controls","stable condition","secretion of IL","group of age-related healthy blood donors","ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells","white blood count","CD8 ratio","Analysis of T","mitogenic stimulation","TNF","treatment","leukocyte differentiation","lymphokines","pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis","tumor necrosis factor","PBMC","correlation","new immunomodulatory strategies","acute relapse","role of immunological mechanisms","response","interferons","IFNs","subcutaneous application of interferon","lymphocyte subtyping","soluble interleukin","cell subsets","higher CD4","changes","deficiency","patient groups","type","lines of evidence","findings","study","receptor","difference","autoimmune diseases","addition"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: COVID-19-related posts (N = 1101) were retrieved from a longitudinal cohort of 52 268 randomly sampled Weibo accounts (December 31, 2019\u2013February 12, 2020). RESULTS: Attention to COVID-19 was limited prior to China openly acknowledging human-to-human transmission on January 20. Following this date, attention quickly increased and has remained high over time. Particularly high levels of social media traffic appeared around when Wuhan was first placed in quarantine (January 23\u201324, 8\u20139% of the overall posts), when a scandal associated with the Red Cross Society of China occurred (February 1, 8%), and, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang (February 6\u20137, 11%), one of the whistleblowers who was reprimanded by the Chinese police in early January for discussing this outbreak online.

METHODS: We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough (67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of the patients on admission. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings.

Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are among the most common causes of respiratory tract infections in children. Little is known about the epidemiology and clinical presentation of HPIV type 4. Methods. A retrospective chart review and comparison of patients positive for HPIV types 1\u20134 by multiplex polymerase chain reaction between 2009 and 2012 at Children\u0027s Hospital Colorado was performed. Patients who had only direct fluorescent antibody testing performed or concurrent viral infections were excluded. Results. Of 11 533 samples, 752 (6.5%) were positive for HPIV. After exclusion criteria, 316 samples were included in the study. HPIV-4 had year-round prevalence with biennial peaks in odd-numbered years. HPIV-4 and HPIV-3 had similar clinical presentations. 50.8% and 51.5% of patients with HPIV-3\u20134 had hypoxia compared to 20.3% and 33.3% of patients with HPIV-1\u20132 (P \u003C .01).

Patients with HPIV-4 had similar lengths of stay and mortality as those with HPIV-1\u20133. Conclusions. This is the first large-scale analysis of HPIV-4 clinical and epidemiologic features. HPIV-4 was most similar to HPIV-3 in clinical presentation. HPIV-4 had year-round prevalence with peaks in the autumn of odd-numbered years. HPIV-4 is a common respiratory pathogen capable of causing significant morbidity in children.","publish_time":"2013-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frost, Holly M.; Robinson, Christine C.; Dominguez, Samuel R.","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33b0d67ccc6337a921154e45b32328a98a0547e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3923541.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24133181/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jit552; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/209/5/695/13804474/jit552.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPIV"],"locations":["Children\u0027s Hospital Colorado"],"keyphrases":["HPIV types","large-scale analysis of HPIV","clinical presentation of HPIV type","comparison of patients positive","similar clinical presentations","year-round prevalence","odd-numbered years","similar lengths","samples","common causes of respiratory tract infections","common respiratory pathogen capable","autumn of odd","biennial peaks","concurrent viral infections","direct fluorescent antibody testing","significant morbidity","retrospective chart review","multiplex polymerase chain reaction","HPIVs","epidemiology","Human parainfluenza viruses","mortality","epidemiologic features","Children\u0027s Hospital Colorado","exclusion criteria","stridor","croup","study","hypoxia","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The blockade of SIV by IFITMs is isolate specific, raising the question of which parameters impact sensitivity to IFITM. We show that the virion context in which SIV-Env is presented and the efficiency of virion incorporation determine Env susceptibility to inhibition by IFITMs. Thus, determinants other than the nature of the envelope protein can impact the IFITM sensitivity of viral entry. IMPORTANCE The host cell-encoded IFITM proteins can block viral entry and are an important component of the innate defenses against viral infection. However, the determinants controlling whether a virus is susceptible to blockade by IFITM proteins are incompletely understood. Our study shows that the amount of envelope proteins incorporated into virions as well as the nature of the virion particle itself can impact the sensitivity of viral entry to IFITMs. These results show for the first time that determinants other than the viral envelope protein can impact sensitivity to IFITM and have implications for the interpretation of previously published data on inhibition of viruses by IFITM proteins. Moreover, our findings might help to define the mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins.","publish_time":"2017-01-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wrensch, Florian; Hoffmann, Markus; G\u00E4rtner, Sabine; Nehlmeier, Inga; Winkler, Michael; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/229bb9dc175fcc4d90e46d9ad90b67ab3e49a536.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5215347.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27807233/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01488-16","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFITM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFITM sensitivity of viral entry","envelope proteins","IFITMs","antiviral activity of IFITM proteins","transmembrane proteins","viral envelope protein","host cell-encoded IFITM proteins","viral infection","parameters impact sensitivity","determinants","cellular entry","SIV-Env","blockade of SIV","inhibition of viruses","virion context","virion particle","nature","efficiency of virion incorporation","enveloped viruses","Env susceptibility","simian immunodeficiency virus","important component","innate defenses","published data","interpretation","mechanism","IMPORTANCE","question","implications","time","Interferon","virions","results","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we focus on the highly conserved nonstructural protein (NSP) 16, a viral 2\u2019O methyl-transferase (MTase) that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection. Using reverse genetics, we disrupted a key motif in the conserved KDKE motif of MERS NSP16 (D130A) and evaluated the effect on viral infection and pathogenesis. While the absence of 2\u2019O MTase activity had only marginal impact on propagation and replication in Vero cells, the MERS dNSP16 mutant demonstrated significant attenuation relative to control both in primary human airway cultures and in vivo. Further examination indicated the MERS dNSP16 mutant had a type I IFN based attenuation and was partially restored in the absence of IFIT molecules. Importantly, the robust attenuation permitted use of MERS dNSP16 as a live attenuated vaccine platform protecting from challenge with a mouse adapted MERS-CoV strain. These studies demonstrate the importance of the conserved 2\u2019O MTase activity for CoV pathogenesis and highlight NSP16 as a conserved universal target for rapid live attenuated vaccine design in an expanding CoV outbreak setting. Coronavirus emergence in both human and livestock represents a significant threat to global public health, as evidenced by the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, PEDV and swine delta coronavirus in the 21st century. These studies describe an approach that effectively targets the highly conserved 2\u2019O methyl-transferase activity of coronaviruses for attenuation. With clear understanding of the IFN/IFIT based mechanism, NSP16 mutants provide a suitable target for a live attenuated vaccine platform as well as therapeutic development for both current and future emergent CoV strains. Importantly, other approaches targeting other conserved pan-coronavirus functions have not yet proven effective against MERS-CoV, illustrating the broad applicability of targeting viral 2\u2019O MTase function across coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2017-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menachery, Vineet D.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Mitchell, Hugh D.; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Leist, Sarah R.; Yount, Boyd L.; Graham, Rachel L.; McAnarney, Eileen T.; Stratton, Kelly G.; Cockrell, Adam S.; Debbink, Kari; Sims, Amy C.; Waters, Katrina M.; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da2e0ca79c487a5339e95bee7b75b10854c77152.json; document_parses/pdf_json/656ef218f7dcea5555a59cdc29d0f9ec8d5c2a82.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/173286","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS","IFIT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV strain","CoV pathogenesis","MERS dNSP16 mutant","conserved KDKE motif of MERS NSP16","O MTase activity","use of MERS dNSP16","conserved universal target","O MTase function","conserved pan-coronavirus functions","O methyl-transferase activity of coronaviruses","conserved nonstructural protein","robust attenuation","viral infection","live attenuated vaccine platform","significant attenuation relative","expanding CoV outbreak setting","future emergent CoV strains","Coronavirus emergence","rapid live attenuated vaccine design","therapeutic design","NSP16 mutants","IFN","studies","swine delta coronavirus","absence of IFIT molecules","suitable target","significant threat","key motif","therapeutic development","critical functions","common targets","sudden emergence of SARS","primary human airway cultures","control","Vero cells","marginal impact","propagation","replication","livestock","challenge","PEDV","genetic elements necessary","novel genes","mechanism","D130A","mouse","possibility","global public health","type","immune modulation","mix","effect","broad applicability","century","clear understanding","approaches","examination","importance","reverse genetics","study"],"language":"en"},

As elective urologic procedures are being reduced to conserve resources, we sought to quantify the PPE used per case to determine the impact on potentially limited resources needed for protecting healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients. Methods An IRB approved retrospective analysis of all urologic procedures in March 2019 and March 2020 was performed. Additionally, all urologic procedures performed by vascular interventional radiology (VIR) in May 2019 and March 2020 were included in the analysis. Case length, surgical and operating room staff present and number of articles of PPE were quantified. Articles of PPE were defined as surgical bonnet/hat and mask, and disposable or reusable gown with one pair of surgical gloves. Results 437 urologic and VIR procedures were included in the analysis. The mean PPE per case varied significantly between endoscopic and robotic categories. Robotic assisted laparoscopic cystectomy required the most hats and masks (14.5 per case in March 2019) whereas percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tube placement by VIR required the fewest (3.1 in May 2019 and March 2020). Conclusions PPE consumption varied significantly across urologic procedures. Robotic-assisted cases require the most PPE and PCN placement by VIR requires the fewest.

We discuss the potential for translation of newly discovered hepatitis viruses into preclinical animal models for drug testing, studies on pathogenesis and vaccine development. Finally, we re-evaluate the evolutionary origins of human hepatitis viruses and discuss the past and present zoonotic potential of their animal homologues.","publish_time":"2018-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rasche, Andrea; Sander, Anna-Lena; Corman, Victor Max; Drexler, Jan Felix","journal":"J Hepatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/323cbf7da8d16c80adeae8d29a243b179f4237cf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6952ad913b9a6613e0a4ce425808f940fc47cb83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114834.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2018.11.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016882781832542X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30472320/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016882781832542X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ2LmNzdjs0MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1725869,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:04Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"f4W0kuqlvL6WWxDn0LwA2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_46.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["discovered hepatitis viruses","diverse viruses","infection patterns of human hepatitis viruses","evolutionary origins of human hepatitis viruses","animal homologues","human health","pathogenesis","preclinical animal models","present zoonotic potential","unique biological properties","oncogenesis","studies","drug testing","striking differences","liver tropism","transmission routes","chronicity","major threats","translation","animals","surprising conservation","vaccine development","envelopment","decade"],"language":"en"},

Pregnancy is a unique physiological condition, and is characterized by altered immunity and elevated hormone levels to actively tolerate the semi-allogeneic fetus, which undergoes a sudden and substantial fluctuation during the immediate postpartum period. Changes in clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of pregnant women during the pre-partum and post-partum periods require further elucidation. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of eight pregnant cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pre-partum and post-partum periods. Our results showed that four of the eight pregnant women were asymptomatic before delivery but became symptomatic post-partum. Correspondingly, white blood cell (WBC) counts increased and lymphocyte (LYMPH) counts decreased. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the serum also increased to a higher level than those in general pregnancy. Therefore, it is imperative to closely monitor laboratory parameters including the WBC count, LYMPH count, and CRP, along with other imaging features in chest CT scans, to promptly prevent, diagnose, and treat a SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.

Abstract Cystic fibrosis (CF), a condition produced by mutations in the gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, is the most prevalent autosomal-recessive hereditary disease in caucasian populations. Among other repercussions, this defect leads to an alteration of respiratory secretions and determines a predisposition for chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection, which is the main driver of the high morbidity and early mortality of CF patients. Colonization by Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae is frequent in children younger than 10 years, but mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa is by far the most relevant pathogen in adults with CF and is responsible for the progressive bronchopulmonary deterioration. As a consequence of repeated, long-lasting antimicrobial treatments and deterioration of lung function, colonization by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter spp. and Burkholderia cepacia complex, is also frequent in adult CF patients. The special characteristics of the pathologic process and the microorganisms implicated in CF make it advisable to consider microbiological follow-up of chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection in these patients a specific diagnostic entity.","publish_time":"2009-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oliver, Antonio; Alarc\u00F3n, Teresa; Caballero, Estrella; Cant\u00F3n, Rafael","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c74a5cadbc629a2d0714f7f69fa4ccfa23a99c64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103330.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X08000281; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X08000281","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus"],"organizations":["CF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["colonizaci\u00F3n-infecci\u00F3n broncopulmonar en","y Burkholderia cepacia complex","adulto y causa principal","adult CF patients","colonizaci\u00F3n por Staphylococcus aureus y Haemophilus influenzae es frecuente en ni\u00F1os menores","los pat\u00F3genos habituales y se a\u00EDslan","propio proceso patol\u00F3gico y","tratamiento antimicrobiano repetido y","early mortality of CF patients","microorganismo m\u00E1s relevante en","colonizaci\u00F3n-infecci\u00F3n broncopulmonar cr\u00F3nica","elevada morbilidad y temprana mortalidad","microbiological follow-up of chronic bronchopulmonary colonization-infection","entre los que destacan Stenothrophomonas maltophilia","Est\u00E1 producida por mutaciones en","Achromobacter","fibrosis qu\u00EDstica","progressive bronchopulmonary deterioration","Abstract Cystic fibrosis","enfermedad hereditaria autos\u00F3mica recesiva m\u00E1s frecuente en","gen que codifica","morfotipo mucoide es","FQ como una entidad diagn\u00F3stica propia","deterioro broncopulmonar progresivo","aunque Pseudomonas aeruginosa","mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa","que determina una predisposici\u00F3n para","cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator","alteraci\u00F3n pulmonar se favorece","Stenotrophomonas maltophilia","Como consecuencia","entre otras","los microorganismos implicados hacen recomendable reconocer","deterioration of lung function","Las connotaciones particulares","fermentadores","mayor frecuencia bacilos gramnegativos","desplazamiento","seguimiento microbiol\u00F3gico","a\u00F1os","poblaci\u00F3n","diferencia","regulador","long-lasting antimicrobial treatments","high morbidity","prevalent autosomal-recessive hereditary disease","multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli","predisposition","estos pacientes","secreciones respiratorias","years","gene","caucasian populations","consequence of repeated","pathologic process","main driver","children younger","conductancia transmembrana","origen cauc\u00E1sico","adults","microorganisms","condition","alteration of respiratory secretions","specific diagnostic entity","relevant pathogen","special characteristics","Este defecto","Resumen","mutations","repercussions"],"language":"en"},

The Elisa was substantially more sensitive than the virus neutralisation test in detecting antibodies to CCoV and may be used as an alternative technique to virus neutralisation.","publish_time":"2002-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pratelli, Annamaria; Elia, Gabriella; Martella, Vito; Palmieri, Alessandra; Cirone, Francesco; Tinelli, Antonella; Corrente, Marialaura; Buonavoglia, Canio","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/010e4485b14ced466c18111dcb99d1a40bee882e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119839.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093401004505; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093401004505","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Elisa positive","routine virus neutralisation test","antibodies","CCoV","confirmatory Western blotting test","antigen canine coronavirus-infected CrFK cell supernatant","dog serum samples","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","total","alternative technique"],"language":"en"},

Important research questions concern the involvement of the host innate immune response in pathogenesis, key to which is the role played by microglia, resident macrophages of the brain parenchyma. Do microglia have a protective function, by coordinating the innate immune response to viral infection, or do they drive pathogenic neuroinflammation? Here we synthesize recent data from mouse models of acute viral encephalitis, which reveal an unambiguously protective role for microglia. Depletion of microglia, via blockade of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling, led to increased viral replication accompanied by more severe neurological disease and heightened mortality. Whilst the underlying mechanism(s) remain to be defined, microglial interactions with T cells and phagocytosis of infected neurones appear to play a role. Paradoxically, the production of inflammatory cytokines was increased in several instances following viral infection in microglia-depleted brains, suggesting that: (i) cells other than microglia mediate inflammatory responses and/or (ii) microglia may exert a regulatory function. Under certain circumstances the microglial antiviral response might contribute negatively to longer-term neurological sequelae, although fewer studies have focused on this aspect in encephalitis models. Understanding regulation of the microglial response, and how it contributes to disease is therefore a priority for future studies. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the central role of microglia in pathogenesis, suggesting the exciting possibility that defects of microglial function might contribute to encephalitis susceptibility and/or outcome in humans.","publish_time":"2019-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hatton, Catherine F.; Duncan, Christopher J.

Several studies have shown that cytokine storms are directly associated with influenza-induced fatal acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Due to the narrow administration window, current antiviral therapies are often inadequate. The efforts to use immunomodulatory agents alone or in combination with antiviral agents in the treatment of influenza in animal models have resulted in the achievement of protective effects accompanied with reduced cytokine production. Currently, there are no immunomodulatory drugs for influenza available for clinical use. Animal models, despite being ideal to study the anti-inflammatory responses to influenza virus infection, are very costly and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish fast and economical screening methods using cell-based models to screen and develop novel immunomodulatory agents. In this study, we screened seven human cell lines and found that the human monocytic cell U937 supports the replication of different subtypes of influenza viruses as well as the production of the important pro-inflammatory cytokines and was selected to develop the cell-based model. The U937 cell model was validated by testing a panel of known antiviral and immunomodulatory agents and screening a drug library consisting of 1280 compounds comprised mostly of FDA-approved drugs. We demonstrated that the U937 cell model is robust and suitable for the high-throughput screening of immunomodulators and antivirals against influenza infection.

The resultant core-doped shell nanohybrids exhibit plasmonic, luminescent and volume thermoresponsive properties, with improved possibilities to be used as successful therapeutic platforms. In fact, the possibility to nanoconfine the synergistic antioxidant, antiviral, antibacterial features of silver and curcumin in one bioavailable hybrid paves the way to promising applications in the biomedical field.","publish_time":"2019-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Soto-Quintero, Albanelly; Guarrotxena, Nekane; Garc\u00EDa, Olga; Quijada-Garrido, Isabel","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9be8c80283a7fed59057d7788eb2850708f45450.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6890765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6890765/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["silver nanoparticles","silver nucleation","curcumin-capped AgNPs","reducing properties of phenolic curcumin substance","silver nitrate addition","antibacterial features of silver","boiling aqueous solution of curcumin","thermoresponsive polymeric shell","sodium citrate","resultant core-doped shell nanohybrids exhibit plasmonic","volume thermoresponsive properties","advantage","assembling","growing polymer chains","improved possibilities","synergistic antioxidant","antiviral","ability","monomers","pot protocol","hydrophobic AgNP surface","bioavailable hybrid","applications","way","radical polymerization initiator","possibility","successful therapeutic platforms","surfactant","biomedical field","metallic surfaces","work","stabilizing agents"],"language":"en"},

HIV relies on multiple regulatory proteins to modify the host cell to promote replication in infected T cells, and these regulatory proteins can have subtle phenotypic differences between subtypes. One of these proteins, HIV-1 Trans-Activator of Transcription (Tat), is capable of RNA interference (RNAi) Silencing Suppressor (RSS) activity and induction of cell death in T cells. However, the subtype-specific RSS activity and induction of cell death have not been explored. We investigated the ability of Tat subtypes and variants to induce RSS activity and cell death. TatB, from HIV-1 subtype B, was found to be a potent RSS activator by 40% whereas TatC, from HIV-1 subtype C, showed 15% RSS activity while subtype TatC variants exhibited varying levels. A high level of cell death (50\u201353%) was induced by subtype TatB when compared to subtype TatC (25\u201328%) and varying levels were observed with subtype TatC variants. These differential activities could be due to variations in the functional domains of Tat.

METHODS: We investigated the seroprevalence of three tissue-cyst-forming apicomplexan parasites (Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum and Besnoitia besnoiti) in 506 individuals of 12 wildlife species in Namibia using in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (indirect ELISAs applying purified antigens) for screening and immunoblots as confirmatory tests. We included six species of the suborder Feliformia, four species of the suborder Caniformia and two species of the suborder Ruminantia. For the two species for which we had most samples and life-history information, i.e. cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus, n = 250) and leopards (Panthera pardus, n = 58), we investigated T. gondii seroprevalence in relation to age class, sex, sociality (solitary, mother-offspring group, independent sibling group, coalition group) and site (natural habitat vs farmland). RESULTS: All but one carnivore species (bat-eared fox Otocyon megalotis, n = 4) were seropositive to T. gondii, with a seroprevalence ranging from 52.4% (131/250) in cheetahs to 93.2% (55/59) in African lions (Panthera leo). We also detected antibodies to T. gondii in 10.0% (2/20) of blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). Adult cheetahs and leopards were more likely to be seropositive to T. gondii than subadult conspecifics, whereas seroprevalence did not vary with sex, sociality and site. Furthermore, we measured antibodies to N. caninum in 15.4% (2/13) of brown hyenas (Hyaena brunnea) and 2.6% (1/39) of black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas). Antibodies to B. besnoiti were detected in 3.4% (2/59) of African lions and 20.0% (4/20) of blue wildebeest. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Namibian wildlife species were exposed to apicomplexan parasites at different prevalences, depending on parasite and host species. In addition to serological work, molecular work is also needed to better understand the sylvatic cycle and the clear role of wildlife in the epidemiology of these parasites in southern Africa.","publish_time":"2020-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seltmann, Anne; Schares, Gereon; Aschenborn, Ortwin H.

Mandatory meningococcal vaccination for all pilgrims against serogroups A and C and, subsequently, A, C, W, and Y controlled the epidemics. Overseas pilgrims show excellent adherence to the policy; however, vaccine uptake among domestic pilgrims is suboptimal. This survey aimed to evaluate meningococcal vaccine uptake among Hajj pilgrims and to identify key factors affecting this. Methods: An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted among pilgrims in Greater Makkah during the Hajj in 2017\u20132018. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, vaccination status, cost of vaccination, and reasons behind non-receipt of the vaccine were collected. Results: A total of 509 respondents aged 13 to 82 (median 33.8) years participated in the survey: 86% male, 85% domestic pilgrims. Only 389/476 (81.7%) confirmed their meningococcal vaccination status; 64 individuals (13.4%), all domestic pilgrims, did not receive the vaccine, and 23 (4.8%) were unsure. Among overseas pilgrims, 93.5% certainly received the vaccine (6.5% were unsure) compared to 80.9% of domestic pilgrims (p \u003C 0.01). Being employed and having a tertiary qualification were significant predictors of vaccination adherence (odds ratio (OR) = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.3\u20133.8, p \u003C 0.01; and OR = 1.7, CI = 1\u20132.5, p \u003C 0.05, respectively). Those who obtained pre-Hajj health advice were more than three times as likely to be vaccinated than those who did not (OR = 3.3, CI = 1.9\u20135.9, p \u003C 0.001). Lack of awareness (63.2%, 36/57) and lack of time (15.8%, 9/57) were the most common reasons reported for non-receipt of vaccine. Conclusion: Many domestic pilgrims missed the compulsory meningococcal vaccine; in this regard, lack of awareness is a key barrier. Being an overseas pilgrim (or living at a distance from Makkah), receipt of pre-Hajj health advice, and employment were predictors of greater compliance with the vaccination policy. Opportunities remain to reduce the policy\u2013practice gap among domestic pilgrims.","publish_time":"2019-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Badahdah, Al-Mamoon; Alghabban, Fatimah; Falemban, Wajd; Albishri, Abdullah; Rani Banik, Gouri; Alhawassi, Tariq; Abuelizz, Hatem; Bakarman, Marwan A.; Khatami, Ameneh; Booy, Robert; Rashid, Harunor","journal":"Trop Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c7260dadc28671d3ba4e14120b63a5232765805.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6958484.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6958484/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["domestic pilgrims","Hajj pilgrims","Overseas pilgrims","meningococcal vaccine uptake","vaccination policy","meningococcal vaccination status","compulsory meningococcal vaccine","Mandatory meningococcal vaccination","non-receipt of vaccine","cost of vaccination","receipt of pre-Hajj health advice","significant predictors of vaccination adherence","Lack of awareness","Greater Makkah","lack of time","Major intercontinental outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease","predictors of greater compliance","anonymous cross-sectional survey","excellent adherence","common reasons","key barrier","key factors","employment","socio-demographic characteristics","regard","tertiary qualification","odds ratio","Background","practice gap","serogroups","respondents","Data","Methods","times","distance","individuals","male","Results","total","epidemics","confidence interval","years","Conclusion","Opportunities"],"language":"en"},

However, whether such recombinant strains could induce desired immune responses in the lung, where TB infection occurs, is not clear. In this paper, C57BL/6 J mice were intranasally vaccinated with attenuated LI\u0394actAplcB-Rv3875 (\u0394 refers to gene deletion in the bacterial genome) or LI\u0394actAplcB-Rv0129c, the two vaccine candidates that utilize LI as an antigen delivery vector. Bacterial load in the target organs, histological changes in the infected organs, the percentage of specific cytokine-secreting T cells in the lung and spleen, IgG levels in the serum and secretory IgA (SIgA) levles in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were determined at specific days post inoculation (dpi). The results showed that both strains were mainly confined to the lung and were eliminated at 10 dpi. The histological damage caused by the infection in the lung was slight and recovered by day 5. Intranasal vaccination of the mice twice at an interval of 4 weeks notably elicited TB antigen-specific CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cell responses in the lung and SIgA secretion in the pulmonary mucosa, and significantly enhanced the percentage of double-functional CD8(\u002B) T cells (IFN-\u03B3(\u002B) TNF-\u03B1(\u002B) CD8(\u002B)). To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the used of LI vector vaccines to induce promising lung-localized cellular and humoral immune responses by intranasal vaccination. These data suggest that LI could be a novel and promising live vector to construct an intranasal vaccine against respiratory diseases.","publish_time":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Ming-juan; Liu, Si-jing; Su, Lin; Zhang, Xiang; Li, Yong-yu; Tang, Tian; Wang, Chuan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/445b086554f3fe551acecca32b722b05579446e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6962167.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6962167/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["LI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antigen-specific cellular immune responses","intranasal vaccine","promising lung-localized cellular","humoral immune responses","desired immune responses","T cell responses","LI vector vaccines","vaccine candidates","TB infection","Intranasal vaccination","elicited TB antigen-specific CD4","antigen delivery vector","percentage of specific cytokine-secreting T cells","promising live vector","functional CD8","J mice","recombinant strains","specific days post inoculation","intravenous immunization of mice","infected organs","target organs","SIgA secretion","bacterial genome","histological changes","LI\u0394actAplcB-Rv0129c","percentage of double","Bacterial load","histological damage","attenuated LI\u0394actAplcB-Rv3875","recombinant Listeria ivanovii","Ag85C protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","levles","secretory IgA","serum","fluid","Mtb","spleen","bronchoalveolar lavage","IgG levels","gene deletion","BAL","weeks","IFN-\u03B3","ESAT","pulmonary mucosa","interval","novel","TNF-\u03B1","paper","C57BL","respiratory diseases","report","knowledge","results","data"],"language":"en"},

In subsequent pregnancies, women develop protective immunity to pregnancy-associated malaria and this has been hypothesized to be due to the acquisition of antibodies to the parasite variant surface antigen VAR2CSA. In this systematic review we provide the first synthesis of the association between antibodies to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens and pregnancy and birth outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies (published up to 07 June 2019) of pregnant women living in P. falciparum endemic areas that examined antibody responses to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens and outcomes including placental malaria, low birthweight, preterm birth, peripheral parasitaemia, maternal anaemia, and severe malaria. RESULTS: We searched 6 databases and identified 33 studies (30 from Africa) that met predetermined inclusion and quality criteria: 16 studies contributed estimates in a format enabling inclusion in meta-analysis and 17 were included in narrative form only. Estimates were mostly from cross-sectional data (10 studies) and were heterogeneous in terms of magnitude and direction of effect. Included studies varied in terms of antigens tested, methodology used to measure antibody responses, and epidemiological setting. Antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC and VAR2CSA antigens, measured at delivery, were associated with placental malaria (9 studies) and may therefore represent markers of infection, rather than correlates of protection. Antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC, but not recombinant VAR2CSA antigens, were associated with trends towards protection from low birthweight (5 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst antibody responses to several antigens were positively associated with the presence of placental and peripheral infections, this review did not identify evidence that any specific antibody response is associated with protection from pregnancy-associated malaria across multiple populations. Further prospective cohort studies using standardized laboratory methods to examine responses to a broad range of antigens in different epidemiological settings and throughout the gestational period, will be necessary to identify and prioritize pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens to advance the development of vaccines and serosurveillance tools targeting pregnant women.","publish_time":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cutts, Julia C.; Agius, Paul A.; Zaw Lin; Powell, Rosanna; Moore, Kerryn; Draper, Bridget; Simpson, Julie A.; Fowkes, Freya J.

The bacterium primarily infects the throat and upper airways and the produced diphtheria toxin (DT), which binds to the elongation factor 2 and blocks protein synthesis, can spread through the bloodstream and affect organs, such as the heart and kidneys. For more than 125 years, the therapy against diphtheria has been based on polyclonal horse sera directed against DT (diphtheria antitoxin; DAT). Animal sera have many disadvantages including serum sickness, batch-to-batch variation in quality and the use of animals for production. In this work, 400 human recombinant antibodies were generated against DT from two different phage display panning strategies using a human immune library. A panning in microtiter plates resulted in 22 unique in vitro neutralizing antibodies and a panning in solution combined with a functional neutralization screening resulted in 268 in vitro neutralizing antibodies. 61 unique antibodies were further characterized as scFv-Fc with 35 produced as fully human IgG1. The best in vitro neutralizing antibody showed an estimated relative potency of 454 IU/mg and minimal effective dose 50% (MED50%) of 3.0 pM at a constant amount of DT (4x minimal cytopathic dose) in the IgG format. The targeted domains of the 35 antibodies were analyzed by immunoblot and by epitope mapping using phage display. All three DT domains (enzymatic domain, translocation domain and receptor binding domain) are targets for neutralizing antibodies. When toxin neutralization assays were performed at higher toxin dose levels, the neutralizing capacity of individual antibodies was markedly reduced but this was largely compensated for by using two or more antibodies in combination, resulting in a potency of 79.4 IU/mg in the in vivo intradermal challenge assay. These recombinant antibody combinations are candidates for further clinical and regulatory development to replace equine DAT.","publish_time":"2020-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wenzel, Esther Veronika; Bosnak, Margarita; Tierney, Robert; Schubert, Maren; Brown, Jeffrey; D\u00FCbel, Stefan; Efstratiou, Androulla; Sesardic, Dorothea; Stickings, Paul; Hust, Michael","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fab81eeec2dde6a9932a07fbc1467a3e51d6f3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6969050.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6969050/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzE5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutralizing antibodies","unique antibodies","human recombinant antibodies","neutralizing capacity of individual antibodies","neutralizing antibody","DT domains","produced diphtheria toxin","diphtheria antitoxin","translocation domain","enzymatic domain","higher toxin dose levels","panning strategies","minimal cytopathic dose","toxin neutralization assays","minimal effective dose","human IgG1","phage display","receptor binding domain","recombinant antibody combinations","human immune library","batch variation","Animal sera","different phage","targeted domains","estimated relative potency","polyclonal horse sera","functional neutralization screening","candidates","solution","upper airways","disadvantages","serum sickness","blocks protein synthesis","elongation factor","regulatory development","use of animals","quality","throat","infectious disease","MED50","IgG format","microtiter plates","Corynebacterium diphtheriae","epitope mapping","work","scFv-Fc","intradermal challenge assay","heart","organs","bloodstream","production","years","therapy","kidneys"],"language":"en"},

Media reports have been shown to influence the public\u2019s health care decisions, including vaccination choices. We analyzed Canadian newspapers\u2019 portrayal of the A/H1N1 vaccine including mention of risks and benefits of the vaccine and whether the article supported, questioned or was neutral about the vaccine. METHODS: We compiled a data set of Canadian newspaper articles (N=234) and conducted a frequency content analysis to examine discussion and/or mention of evidence concerning vaccination, risks of the A/H1N1 virus and the vaccine, and tone of article in regards to the vaccination program in Canada. RESULTS: Reasons for getting vaccinated appeared in 71.8% of the articles, whereas only 18.4% provided reasons against getting vaccinated. Discussion of evidence to support claims for or against getting vaccinated appeared in only 27.8% and 6.8% of the articles, respectively. Risks associated with contracting the A/H1N1 virus were discussed in 49.6% of the articles and risks of the A/H1N1 vaccine were discussed in 12.4% of the articles. CONCLUSION: Newspaper coverage in Canada was largely supportive of the A/H1N1 mass vaccination program. However, serious risks associated with contracting the A/H1N1 virus were also frequently discussed in the print media. The news articles rarely presented direct evidence to support statements that the vaccine was safe, effective and properly tested. Known risks (such as potential allergic reactions and flu-like side effects) of the vaccine were rarely reported.

Baseline characteristics, presentations, comorbid conditions, endoscopic findings, treatments, and outcomes were compared between immunocompetent and immunocompromised. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-three patients (56 immunocompetent, 117 immunocompromised) were included. Immunocompetent patients were significantly older than immunocompromised patients (73 vs. 48.6 years, p \u003C 0.0001).

Significantly higher mortality was observed in immunocompetent than in immunocompromised patients, but this could be due to more severe concomitant illnesses in the immunocompetent group.","publish_time":"2020-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaemsupaphan, Thanaboon; Limsrivilai, Julajak; Thongdee, Chenchira; Sudcharoen, Asawin; Pongpaibul, Ananya; Pausawasdi, Nonthalee; Charatcharoenwitthaya, Phunchai","journal":"BMC Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8682b182883c2e9f29abf07085b783749f2d2252.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6990526.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6990526/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Siriraj Hospital","ICU"],"locations":["Bangkok","Thailand"],"keyphrases":["immunocompetent patients","immunocompromised patients","immunocompetent elderly patients","immunocompetent group","GI-CMV infection","immunocompromised status","GI bleeding","Blood CMV viral load","common presentation","severe concomitant illnesses","higher mortality","data specific","leading presentation","specific therapy","Six-month mortality","main treatment","ICU clinical setting","Independent predictors of death","independent protective factor","old age","comorbid conditions","presentations","endoscopic findings","diarrhea","Siriraj Hospital","cytomegaloviral","comorbidities","treatments","Bangkok","outcomes","abdominal pain","antiviral agents","Baseline characteristics","retrospective study","Thailand","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSION","years","Ganciclovir","groups","time of diagnosis","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This has also been associated with weak transmission control, mostly due to poor control of asymptomatic patients associated with host-vector transmission. This highlights the importance of studying the parasite\u2019s sexual forms (gametocytes) which are involved in this phase of the parasite\u2019s life-cycle. Some African and Asian strains of Plasmodium falciparum have been fully characterized regarding sexual forms\u2019 production; however, few Latin-American strains have been so characterized. This study was aimed at characterizing the Colombian FCB2 strain as a gametocyte producer able to infect mosquitoes. METHODS: Gametocyte production was induced in in vitro cultured P. falciparum FCB2 and 3D7 strains. Pfap2g and Pfs25 gene expression was detected in FCB2 strain gametocyte culture by RT-PCR. Comparative analysis of gametocytes obtained from both strains was made (counts and morphological changes). In vitro zygote formation from FCB2 gametocytes was induced by incubating a gametocyte culture sample at 27 \u00B0C for 20 min. A controlled Anopheles albimanus infection was made using an artificial feed system with cultured FCB2 gametocytes (14\u201315 days old). Mosquito midgut dissection was then carried out for analyzing oocysts. RESULTS: The FCB2 strain expressed Pfap2g, Pfs16, Pfg27/25 and Pfs25 sexual differentiation-related genes after in vitro sexual differentiation induction, producing gametocytes that conserved the expected morphological features. The amount of FCB2 gametocytes produced was similar to that from the 3D7 strain. FCB2 gametocytes were differentiated into zygotes and ookinetes after an in vitro low-temperature stimulus and infected An. albimanus mosquitoes, developing to oocyst stage. CONCLUSIONS: Even with the history of long-term FCB2 strain in vitro culture maintenance, it has retained its sexual differentiation ability. The gametocytes produced here preserved these parasite forms\u2019 usual characteristics and An. albimanus infection capability, thus enabling its use as a tool for studying sexual form biology, An. albimanus infection comparative analysis and anti-malarial drug and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ararat-Sarria, Monica; Prado, Cesar Camilo; Camargo, Milena; Ospina, Laura Tatiana; Camargo, Paola Andrea; Curtidor, Hernando; Patarroyo, Manuel Alfonso","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d90f5b3a7c5019cdb79ebf69353e740d653bf9a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6998264.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6998264/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Anopheles"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cultured FCB2 gametocytes","falciparum FCB2","FCB2 strain gametocyte culture","Colombian FCB2 strain","Comparative analysis of gametocytes","history of long-term FCB2","sexual differentiation induction","sexual forms\u2019 production","sexual differentiation ability","albimanus mosquitoes","Gametocyte production","parasite\u2019s sexual forms","3D7 strains","albimanus infection comparative analysis","albimanus infection capability","sexual form biology","gametocyte culture sample","Pfs25 sexual differentiation-related genes","Latin-American strains","weak transmission control","controlled Anopheles albimanus infection","gametocyte producer able","Pfap2g","culture maintenance","Asian strains of Plasmodium falciparum","epidemiological control of malaria","poor control of asymptomatic patients","anti-malarial drugs","appearance of parasite resistance","resistance of mosquito vectors","parasite forms\u2019 usual characteristics","morphological changes","Pfs25 gene expression","host-vector transmission","parasite\u2019s life-cycle","expected morphological features","Mosquito midgut dissection","artificial feed system","Pfg27","low-temperature stimulus","Pfs16","vaccine development","RT-PCR","tool","ookinetes","use","zygotes","phase","BACKGROUND","measures","counts","oocyst stage","importance","zygote formation","RESULTS","days old","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","study","oocysts"],"language":"en"}]}

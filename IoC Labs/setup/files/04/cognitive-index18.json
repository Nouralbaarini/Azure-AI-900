Evidence has suggested that negative coping styles may be related to subsequent mental illness. Therefore, we investigate the general population\u0027s psychological distress and coping styles in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods A cross-sectional battery of surveys was conducted from February 1-4, 2020. The Kessler 6 psychological distress scale, the simplified coping style questionnaire and a general information questionnaire were administered on-line to a convenience sample of 1599 in China. Spearman\u0027s correlation was used to measure the correlations among category variables. Results General population\u0027s psychological distress were significant differences based on age, marriage, epidemic contact characteristics, concern with media reports, and perceived impacts of the epidemic outbreak (all p \u003C0.001) except gender (p=0.316). Those with a history of visiting Wuhan and a history of epidemics occurring in the community, more concern with media reports, perceived more severe impacts and negative coping style had a higher level of psychological distress, which was significantly positively correlated with a history of visiting Wuhan (r=0.548, p\u003C0.001), a history of epidemics occurring in the community (r=0.219, p\u003C0.001), and concern with media reports (r=0.192, p\u003C0.001). Coping styles were significantly different across all category variables (all p \u003C0.001), and negatively correlated with other category variables (all p\u003C0.01) except age and marriage. Psychological distress was significantly negatively correlated with the coping style (r=-0.573, p\u003C0.01). Conclusions In the early stages of COVID-19, general population with epidemic contact characteristics, excessive concern with media reports, and perceived more severe impacts have higher levels of psychological distress. Psychological distress was significantly negatively correlated with the coping style. Interventions should be implemented early, especially for those population with a high level of psychological distress and/or with a negative coping style.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hui-yao; Xia, Qian; Xiong, Zhen-zhen; Li, Zhi-xiong; Xiang, Wei-yi; Yuan, Yi-wen; Liu, Ya-ya; li, zhe","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045807","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["psychological distress scale","general population\u0027s psychological distress","higher level of psychological distress","higher levels of psychological distress","high level of psychological distress","negative coping styles","media reports","simplified coping style questionnaire","epidemic outbreak","perceived impacts","history of epidemics","category variables","epidemic contact characteristics","general information questionnaire","early stages of COVID","history of visiting Wuhan","severe impacts","excessive concern","community","marriage","significant differences","coronavirus disease","Methods","cross-sectional battery of surveys","subsequent mental illness","correlations","Conclusions","Kessler","Evidence","convenience sample","China","Background","gender","Spearman\u0027s correlation","Interventions"],"language":"en"},

However, many medical professional societies recommended their continued use given the paucity of clinical evidence but there is need for an updated systematic review of latest clinical studies. Methods: A search was conducted on PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and various preprint servers for studies comparing clinical outcomes and mortality in COVID-19 patients on ACEI and/or ARB. Results: A total of eight studies were included in the review. There were conflicting findings reported in several studies as Meng J. et al, Liu Y. et al and Feng Y. reported that patients on ACE inhibitors/ARB had lower rates of severe outcomes whereas Richardson S. et al reported higher rates of invasive ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in patients on ACE inhibitors/ARB as compared to non-users. However, Zhang P. et al found slightly higher rates of ICU admissions in patients on ACE inhibitors and ARB as compared to non-users. Similarly, there were conflicting results in the rate of mortality reported by the various clinical studies as well. Meng J. et al, Li J. et al and Zhang P. et al reported lower rates of mortality in ACE inhibitors/ARB users versus non-users whereas Guo J. et al reported higher rates of mortality in patients on ACE inhibitors/ARB as compared to non-users. Additionally, a large study conducted in New York by Richardson S. et al raised concerns with worse mortality outcomes in patients on ACEI/ ARB. Conclusion: It is concluded that ACEI and ARB should be continued in COVID-19 patients, albeit while exercising caution until larger clinical studies and randomized controlled trials confirm their safety. Additionally, the individual patient factors like ACE2 polymorphisms which might confer higher risk of adverse outcomes need to be evaluated further.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grover, A.; Oberoi, M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0beeac7692f61dbadfb0857565a957314b9232b0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.29.20085787v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Meng J.","Liu Y.","Feng Y.","Zhang P. et al","Guo J. et"],"organizations":["ARB","ACEI","Google Scholar","ICU","ACEI/ ARB"],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["patients","ARB users","ACE inhibitors","reported higher rates of mortality","ACEI","reported lower rates of mortality","clinical outcomes","non-users","various clinical studies","larger clinical studies","enzyme inhibitors","reported higher rates of invasive ventilation","worse mortality outcomes","higher rates of ICU admissions","lower rates of severe outcomes","rate of mortality","COVID","updated systematic review of latest clinical studies","higher risk of adverse outcomes","paucity of clinical evidence","Richardson","angiotensin receptor blockers","raised concerns","ACE2 receptor upregulation","continued use","Zhang","Meng","conflicting results","target receptor site","ACE2 polymorphisms","conflicting findings","various preprint servers","Guo","intensive care unit","EMBASE","randomized controlled trials","Google Scholar","New York","caution","SARS-CoV","PubMed","individual patient factors","medical professional societies","virus","Liu","Feng","large study","search","safety","Introduction","total","Methods","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

This article describes the first 2226 consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the La Paz University Hospital in Madrid. METHODS Our cohort included all consecutively admitted patients who were hospitalized and who had a final outcome (death or discharge) in a 1286-bed hospital of Madrid (Spain) from February 25th (first case admitted) to April 19th, 2020. Data was entered manually into an electronic case report form, which was monitored prior to the analysis. RESULTS We consecutively included 2226 adult patients admitted to the hospital who either died (460) or were discharged (1766). The patients median age was 61 years; 51.8% were women. The most common comorbidity was arterial hypertension (41.3%). The most common symptoms on admission were fever (71.2%). The median time from disease onset to hospital admission was 6 days. Overall mortality was 20.7% and was higher in men (26.6% vs 15.1%). Seventy-five patients with a final outcome were transferred to the ICU (3.4%). Most patients admitted to the ICU were men, and the median age was 64 years. Baseline laboratory values on admission were consistent with an impaired immune-inflammatory profile. CONCLUSIONS We provide a description of the first large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Europe. Advanced age, male gender, the presence of comorbidities and abnormal laboratory values were more common among the patients with fatal outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borobia, A.

Deficits in predictive coding may contribute to difficulties with social communication and overreliance on repetitive predictable environments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a mismatch negativity (MMN) task involving rhythmic tone sequences of varying complexity, we tested the hypotheses that 1) individuals with ASD have reduced MMN response to auditory stimuli that deviate in presentation timing from expected patterns, particularly as pattern complexity increases and 2) amplitude of MMN signal is inversely correlated with level of impairment in social communication and repetitive behaviors. Electroencephalography was acquired as individuals (age 6-21years) listened to repeated five-rhythm tones that varied in the Shannon entropy of the rhythm across three conditions (zero, medium-1 bit) and high-2 bit entropy). The majority of the tones conformed to the established rhythm (standard tones); occasionally the 4th tone was temporally shifted relative to its expected time of occurrence (deviant tones). Social communication and repetitive behaviors were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. Both neurotypical controls (n=19) and individuals with ASD (n=21) show stepwise decreases in MMN as a function of increasing entropy. Contrary to the result forecasted by a predictive coding hypothesis, individuals with ASD do not differ from controls in these neural mechanisms of prediction error to auditory rhythms of varied temporal complexity, and there is no relationship between these signals and social communication or repetitive behavior measures. Lay Summary We tested the idea that the brain\u2019s ability to use previous experience to influence processing of sounds is weaker in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than in neurotypical individuals. We found no difference between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls in brain wave responses to sounds that occurred earlier than expected in either simple or complex rhythms. There was also no relationship between these brain waves and social communication or repetitive behavior scores.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Knight, Emily J.; Oakes, Leona A.; Hyman, Susan L.; Freedman, Edward G.; Foxe, John J.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f1306683fad3edf1986eea14493fddc3efefe04.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.077438","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASD","MMN","Social Responsiveness Scale"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ASD","neurotypical individuals","aspects of social communication","repetitive behaviors","Repetitive Behavior Scale","rhythm tones","Social Responsiveness Scale","repetitive behavior measures","repetitive behavior scores","neurotypical controls","repetitive predictable environments","MMN response","expected patterns","deviant tones","standard tones","auditory rhythms of varied temporal complexity","autism spectrum disorder","temporal patterns","pattern complexity","amplitude of MMN signal","brain\u2019s ability","relationship","established rhythm","Shannon entropy","predictive coding hypothesis","expected time of occurrence","function of increasing entropy","rhythmic tone sequences of varying complexity","auditory stimuli","brain waves","complex rhythms","processing of sounds","brain wave responses","task","overreliance","speech perception","neural mechanisms of prediction error","upcoming events","previous experience","presentation timing","difficulties","level of impairment","signals","idea","result","stepwise decreases","hypotheses","mismatch negativity","age","conditions","difference","Lay Summary","Deficits","Electroencephalography","years","majority"],"language":"en"},

CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P \u003E 0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P \u003C 0.05). Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Zhichao; Yu, Qizhi; Yao, Shanhu; Luo, Lei; Duan, Junhong; Yan, Zhimin; Yang, Min; Tan, Hongpei; Ma, Mengtian; Li, Ting; Yi, Dali; Mi, Ze; Zhao, Huafei; Jiang, Yi; He, Zhenhu; Li, Huiling; Nie, Wei; Liu, Yin; Zhao, Jing; Luo, Muqing; Liu, Xuanhui; Rong, Pengfei; Wang, Wei","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e2bc97a6164191ba3d53abfa49ccd973aa80326.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.20025296","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["CT","NCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe NCP","CT severity score","nonimported patients","included patients","CT images","moderate NCP","predictive value of CT","chest CT examinations","severe lung involvement","clinical characteristics","short-term progression","sensitivity analysis","Clinical data","early admission","clinical outcomes","progressive group","Multivariate logistic regression analysis","short-term disease progression","higher NLR","independent risk factors","segment involvement","Wuhan","stable group","days","Spearman correlation analysis","novel coronavirus pneumonia","inflammatory levels","higher neutrophil","inflammatory indexes","independent predictors","sensitivity analyses","lymphocyte ratio","odds ratio","consistent results","close association","ground-glass opacities","consolidation","lobe","COVID","infection","hospitalization","lesion distribution","groups","total","electronic medical records","interstitial thickening","symptom onset","significant difference","Methods","surveillance","Conclusion","Objective","confidence interval","Materials"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We examined 139 serum specimens collected from 112 patients with COVID-19 and 48 serum specimens collected from 48 non-COVID-19 patients. The presence of IgM/IgG antibody for SARS-CoV2 was determined using the One Step Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) IgM/IgG Antibody Test. Chest CT was performed in COVID-19 patients on admission. Findings: Of the 139 COVID-19 serum specimens, IgM was detected in 27.8%, 48.0%, and 95.8% of the specimens collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and \u003E2 weeks after symptom onset and IgG was detected in 3.3%, 8.0%, and 62.5%, respectively. Among the 48 non-COVID-19 serum specimens, 1 generated a false-positive result for IgM. Thirty-eight of the 112 COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic, of whom 15 were positive for IgM, and 74 were symptomatic, of whom 22 were positive for IgM and 7 were positive for IgG. The diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan alone and in combination with the IC assay was 57.9 % (22/38) and 68.4% (26/38) for the asymptomatic patients and 74.3% (55/74) and 82.4% (61/74) for the symptomatic patients, respectively. Conclusion: The IC assay had low sensitivity during the early phase of infection, and thus IC assay alone is not recommended for initial diagnostic testing for COVID-19. If RT-qPCR is not available, the combination of chest CT and IC assay may be useful for diagnosing COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imai, Kazuo; Tabata, Sakiko; Ikeda, Mayu; Noguchi, Sakiko; Kitagawa, Yutaro; Matuoka, Masaru; Miyoshi, Kazuyasu; Tarumoto, Norihito; Sakai, Jun; Ito, Toshimitsu; Maesaki, Shigefumi; Tamura, Kaku; Maeda, Takuya","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.22.20075564v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IgG"],"organizations":["IgM/IgG","IgM/IgG Antibody","IgM","CT","IC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-COVID","diagnosing COVID","IC assay","serum specimens","IgG antibody assay","presence of IgM","asymptomatic patients","combination of chest CT","diagnostic sensitivity of CT scan","SARS-CoV2","false-positive result","weeks","chest computed tomography","diagnosis of Coronavirus disease","Step Novel Coronavirus","low sensitivity","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","initial diagnostic testing","early phase of infection","immunochromatographic","clinical performance","symptom onset","Conclusion","RT-qPCR","Background","Methods","admission","Findings"],"language":"en"},

Methods Anonymous surveys were emailed to members of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO). The spread of COVID-19 and its impact on gynecologic oncology care in terms of alterations to normal treatment patterns and anticipated challenges were assessed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to determine risk factors for COVID-19 infection. Results We analyzed the responses of 331 gynecologic oncology providers. COVID-19 is present in 99.1% of surveyed communities with 99.7% reporting mitigation efforts in effect. The infection rate differs significantly between regions (p\u226A0.001) with the Northeast reporting the highest number of COVID-19 cases. Practice volume has dropped by 61.6% since the start of the pandemic with most cancellations being provider initiated. A majority of responders (52.8%) believed that ovarian cancer will be the most affected cancer by COVID-19. \u003E94% of responders are proceeding with gynecologic cancer surgeries with exception of grade 1, endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (36.3%). Surgical backlog (58.6%), delayed cancer diagnosis (43.2%) and re-establishing normal care with delayed patient (37.8%) were identified as the top 3 challenges after COVID-19 has abated. Conclusions COVID-19 is widespread and has radically altered normal practice patterns. Despite COVID-19 related concerns, most gynecologic oncology care is proceeding. However, the steep decline in clinical volume shows there is a large group of patients who are not being diagnosed or are deferring care.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakayama, John; El-Nashar, Sherif A.; Waggoner, Steven; Traughber, Bryan; Kesterson, Joshua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18757087ed87abdb92d7032008f05d7ad7bc123a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0090825820310970; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090825820310970?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Anonymous"],"organizations":["Northeast"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gynecologic oncology care","normal care","Conclusions COVID","spread of COVID","normal practice patterns","Society of Gynecologic Oncology","gynecologic oncology providers","gynecologic cancer surgeries","normal standard of care","highest number of COVID","Practice volume","national practice patterns","normal treatment patterns","affected cancer","ovarian cancer","current clinical practice","delayed cancer diagnosis","clinical volume","anticipated challenges","anticipated delays","delayed patient","infection rate","majority of responders","reporting mitigation efforts","terms of alterations","exception of grade","members","related concerns","impact","surveyed communities","areas of concern","risk factors","Northeast","deviations","Wilcoxon rank sum test","endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma","pandemic","cancellations","Methods Anonymous surveys","regions","large group of patients","effect","steep decline","cases","responses","SGO","Abstract Objective","start","Surgical backlog"],"language":"en"},

We present a comprehensive report of Covid-19 patients in Iran. Methods One hundred hospitalized patients with Covid-19 were studied. Data on potential source of exposure, demographic, clinical, and paraclinical features, therapy outcome, and post-discharge follow-up were analyzed. Results The median age of the patients was 58 years, and the majority of the patients (72.7%) were above 50 years of age. Fever was present in 45.2% of the patients on admission. The most common clinical symptoms were shortness of breath (74%) and cough (68%). Most patients had elevated C-reactive protein (92.3%), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (82.9%), lymphocytopenia (74.2 %) on admission. Lower lobes of the lung were most commonly involved, and ground-glass opacity (81.8%) was the most frequent finding in CT scans. The administration of hydroxychloroquine improved the clinical outcome of the patients. Lopinavir/ritonavir was efficacious at younger ages. Of the 70 discharged patients, 40% had symptom relapse, (8.6%) were readmitted to the hospital, and 3 patients (4.3%) died. Conclusion This report demonstrates a heterogeneous nature of clinical manifestations in patients affected with Covid-19. The most common presenting symptoms are non-specific, so attention should be made on broader testing, especially in age groups with the greatest risk and younger individuals who can serve as carriers of the disease. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (in younger age group) can be potential treatment options. Finally, patients discharged from the hospital should be followed up because of potential symptom relapse.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ashraf, Mohammad Ali; Shokouhi, Nasim; Shirali, Elham; Davari-tanha, Fateme; Memar, Omeed; Kamalipour, Alireza; Azarnoush, Ayein; Mabadi, Avin; Ossareh, Adele; Sanginabadi, Milad; Mokhtari Azad, Talat; Aghaghazvini, Leila; Ghaderkhani, Sara; Poordast, Tahereh; Pourdast, Alieh; Nazemi, Pershang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7091ed81d4ee453fd3fa60bce4b0b4b9bcd6feb6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20072421v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lopinavir"],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["discharged patients","hospitalized patients","clinical outcome","years of age","younger age group","common clinical symptoms","age groups","median age","potential symptom relapse","comprehensive report of Covid","younger individuals","ritonavir","younger ages","Lopinavir","admission","heterogeneous nature of clinical manifestations","potential source of exposure","common presenting symptoms","potential treatment options","therapy outcome","administration of hydroxychloroquine","recent coronavirus disease","elevated C-reactive protein","elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate","demographic","paraclinical features","attention","information","greatest risk","growing need","shortness of breath","post-discharge follow-up","broader testing","frequent finding","CT scans","Data","carriers","Methods","Lower lobes","lung","ground-glass opacity","Purpose","Conclusion","lymphocytopenia","majority","Iran","cough","Fever"],"language":"en"},

Despite their accuracy for single sample analysis, infectious diseases diagnostic tools, like RT-PCR, require substantial resources to test large populations. We develop a scalable approach for determining the viral status of pooled patient samples. Our approach converts group testing to a linear inverse problem, where false positives and negatives are interpreted as generated by a noisy communication channel, and a message passing algorithm estimates the illness status of patients. Numerical results reveal that our approach estimates patient illness using fewer pooled measurements than existing noisy group testing algorithms.

We explored COVID-19 control strategies that could offer the greatest benefit in resource limited settings. Methods Using an age-structured SEIR model, we explored the effects of COVID-19 control interventions--a lockdown, physical distancing measures, and active case finding (testing and isolation, contact tracing and quarantine)-- implemented individually and in combination to control a hypothetical COVID-19 epidemic in Kathmandu (population 2.6 million), Nepal. Results A month-long lockdown that is currently in place in Nepal will delay peak demand for hospital beds by 36 days, as compared to a base scenario of no interventions (peak demand at 108 days (IQR 97-119); a 2 month long lockdown will delay it by 74 days, without any difference in annual mortality, or healthcare demand volume. Year-long physical distancing measures will reduce peak demand to 36% (IQR 23%-46%) and annual morality to 67% (IQR 48%-77%) of base scenario. Following a month long lockdown with ongoing physical distancing measures and an active case finding intervention that detects 5% of the daily infection burden could reduce projected morality and peak demand by more than 99%. Interpretation Limited resources settings are best served by a combination of early and aggressive case finding with ongoing physical distancing measures to control the COVID-19 epidemic.

Cancer history appears to be a poor prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients, though the reasons for this are unclear. In this report, we assess if extent of prior lung irradiation is a risk factor for death due to COVID-19 infection. Methods Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 14th and April 15th, 2020 at our institution and previously received radiotherapy for cancer in our department were included in this analysis. Patient characteristics and metrics describing the extent of lung irradiation were tabulated. Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of death following COVID-19 diagnosis. A logistic model was used to characterize the association between mean lung radiotherapy dose and 14-day mortality risk following COVID-19 diagnosis. Results 107 patients met inclusion criteria. With a median follow-up of 7 days from COVID-19 diagnosis for surviving patients, 24 deaths have been observed. The actuarial survival rate 14 days after COVID-19 testing is 66%. Increasing mean lung dose (HR per Gy = 1.1, p=0.002), lung cancer diagnosis (HR=3.0, p=0.034), and receiving radiotherapy between one month and one year before COVID-19 testing (HR = 3.4, p=0.013) were associated with increased risk of death. Our survival model demonstrates a near linear relationship between mortality risk following COVID-19 diagnosis and mean lung radiotherapy dose. Conclusions COVID-19 patients with a history of radiotherapy for cancer have a poor prognosis, and mortality risk appears to be associated with extent of lung irradiation. Validation of these findings will be critical as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kabarriti, Rafi; Brodin, N.

Constant expiratory flow, as provided by the new flow-controlled ventilation (FCV) mode, was shown to improve lung recruitment. We hypothesized that lung aeration and respiratory mechanics improve in obese patients during FCV. METHODS: We compared FCV and volume-controlled (VCV) ventilation in 23 obese patients in a randomized crossover setting. Starting with baseline measurements, ventilation settings were kept identical except for the ventilation mode related differences (VCV: inspiration to expiration ratio 1:2 with passive expiration, FCV: inspiration to expiration ratio 1:1 with active, linearized expiration). Primary endpoint of the study was the change of end-expiratory lung volume compared to baseline ventilation. Secondary endpoints were the change of mean lung volume, respiratory mechanics and hemodynamic variables. RESULTS: The loss of end-expiratory lung volume and mean lung volume compared to baseline was lower during FCV compared to VCV (end-expiratory lung volume: FCV, \u2212 126 \u00B1 207 ml; VCV, \u2212 316 \u00B1 254 ml; p \u003C 0.001, mean lung volume: FCV, \u2212 108.2 \u00B1 198.6 ml; VCV, \u2212 315.8 \u00B1 252.1 ml; p \u003C 0.001) and at comparable plateau pressure (baseline, 19.6 \u00B1 3.7; VCV, 20.2 \u00B1 3.4; FCV, 20.2 \u00B1 3.8 cmH(2)O; p = 0.441), mean tracheal pressure was higher (baseline, 13.1 \u00B1 1.1; VCV, 12.9 \u00B1 1.2; FCV, 14.8 \u00B1 2.2 cmH(2)O; p \u003C 0.001). All other respiratory and hemodynamic variables were comparable between the ventilation modes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, compared to VCV, FCV improves regional ventilation distribution of the lung at comparable PEEP, tidal volume, P(Plat) and ventilation frequency. The increase in end-expiratory lung volume during FCV was probably caused by the increased mean tracheal pressure which can be attributed to the linearized expiratory pressure decline.

One hundered and seven complete sequences and 1022 S1-region sequences of Chinese IBVs isolated between 1994 and 2014 were analysed by using MEGA 5.0 software and the Bayesian analysis sampling trees (BEAST) method, and selection pressure on different proteins was assessed. The phylogenetic dissimilarity of different gene trees in the data set indicated possible recombination. Fourteen isolates were identified as recombinants, possibly generated from vaccines of the Massachusetts serotype in recombination with circulating viruses. The earliest IBV in China was found to have existed in the early 1900s, and continues to evolve at a rate of approximately 10(\u2212) (5) substitutions per site per year. We found that purifying selection was the main evolutionary pressure in the protein-coding regions, while the S1 gene bears the greatest positive selection pressure.

We found that MERS-CoV infection induced pyroptosis and over-activation of complement in human macrophages. The hDPP4-Tg mice infected with MERS-CoV overexpressed caspase-1 in the spleen and showed high IL-1\u03B2 levels in serum, suggesting that pyroptosis occurred after infection. However, when the C5a-C5aR1 axis was blocked by an anti-C5aR1 antibody (Ab), expression of caspase-1 and IL-1\u03B2 fell.

Summary Introduction Although less frequent than viral induced recurrent cough; chronic cough remains a sometimes difficult to resolve diagnostic tool. State of the art Most authors estimate that a cough can by considered as chronic after three weeks of duration. Few papers have been published concerning etiologic diagnosis of chronic cough in childhood but these indicate the same main causes as in adults: cough variant asthma, postnasal drip syndrome, gastro-eosophageal reflux. Nevertheless, each age bracket presents specific diagnosis : malformations between zero and one year, psychogenic cough in adolescents. Perspectives New techniques as induced sputum studies helps to reifine chronic cough diagnosis in childhood (after 7 years). Eosinophilic bronchitis, associated or not to bronchial hyperresponsiveness has important therapeutic consequences because associated with a favourable response to corticosteroids. Other techniques will be developped in the future (exhaled NO for example). Conclusions Chronic cough in childhood must be investigated from an anatomic point of view and on frequency arguments. Control and removal of the cough will only be obtained if a precise diagnosis and a suitable treatment are reached.","publish_time":"2004-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pradal, M.; Retornaz, K.; Poisson, A.","journal":"Revue des Maladies Respiratoires","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/adbc6b40698e83cc372bfab183f5b504841af599.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842504714163; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842504714163","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Eosinophilic"],"organizations":[],"locations":["State"],"keyphrases":["toux chronique","cough can","chronic cough remains","psychogenic cough in adolescents","disparition de la toux","toux psychog\u00E8ne","enfant","chronic cough in childhood but these indicate the same main causes as in adults","Perspectives New techniques as induced sputum studies helps to reifine chronic cough diagnosis in childhood","the cough will only be obtained if","toux r\u00E9p\u00E9t\u00E9es li\u00E9es","Conclusions Chronic cough in childhood must be investigated from an anatomic point","Other techniques will be developped in the future","precise diagnosis","Perspectives Des techniques","diagnostic \u00E9tiologique","diagnostic pr\u00E9cis","considered as chronic after three weeks","to bronchial hyperresponsiveness","Summary Introduction Although less frequent than viral induced recurrent cough","sometimes difficult to resolve diagnostic tool","reflux gastro","published concerning etiologic diagnosis","favourable response to corticosteroids","each age bracket presents specific diagnosis","the art Most authors estimate that","associated or","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Introduction","eosophageal reflux","frequency arguments","arguments de fr\u00E9quence","m\u00EAmes causes principales","important therapeutic consequences because associated with","malformations between zero","asthma","view","postnasal drip syndrome","infections virales","exhaled NO","cons\u00E9quences th\u00E9rapeutiques indiscutables","removal","\u00E9tiologies","hyperr\u00E9activit\u00E9 bronchique","Nevertheless","adulte","duration","probl\u00E8me diagnostique","suitable treatment","Eosinophilic bronchitis","dur\u00E9e","majorit\u00E9 des auteurs","\u00E2ge","sinusite","example","papers","years","pathologies ORL","raisonnement anatomique","bronchite","\u00E9osinophiles","\u00C9tats des connaissances","Chaque tranche","asthme","corticosensibilit\u00E9","expectoration induite","traitement adapt\u00E9","\u00E9tudes","reached","nouvelles","cas","exploration","semaines","d\u00E9couverte","ans","contr\u00F4le"],"language":"fr"},

Effort to find antivirals for it has focused on bioflavonoids, a plant-derived polyphenolic compounds with many potential health benefits. In the present study, antiviral activity of four types of bioflavonoid against dengue virus type -2 (DENV-2) in Vero cell was evaluated. Anti-dengue activity of these compounds was determined at different stages of DENV-2 infection and replication cycle. DENV replication was measured by Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) and quantitative RT-PCR. Selectivity Index value (SI) was determined as the ratio of cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC(50)) to inhibitory concentration 50 (IC(50)) for each compound. RESULTS: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of quercetin against dengue virus was 35.7 \u03BCg mL(-1 )when it was used after virus adsorption to the cells. The IC(50 )decreased to 28.9 \u03BCg mL(-1 )when the cells were treated continuously for 5 h before virus infection and up to 4 days post-infection. The SI values for quercetin were 7.07 and 8.74 \u03BCg mL(-1), respectively, the highest compared to all bioflavonoids studied. Naringin only exhibited anti-adsorption effects against DENV-2 with IC(50 )= 168.2 \u03BCg mL(-1 )and its related SI was 1.3. Daidzein showed a weak anti-dengue activity with IC(50 )= 142.6 \u03BCg mL(-1 )when the DENV-2 infected cells were treated after virus adsorption. The SI value for this compound was 1.03. Hesperetin did not exhibit any antiviral activity against DENV-2. The findings obtained from Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay (FFURA) were corroborated by findings of the qRT-PCR assays. Quercetin and daidzein (50 \u03BCg mL(-1)) reduced DENV-2 RNA levels by 67% and 25%, respectively. There was no significant inhibition of DENV-2 RNA levels with naringin and hesperetin. CONCLUSION: Results from the study suggest that only quercetin demonstrated significant anti-DENV-2 inhibitory activities. Other bioflavonoids, including daidzein, naringin and hesperetin showed minimal to no significant inhibition of DENV-2 virus replication. These findings, together with those previously reported suggest that select group of bioflavonoids including quercetin and fisetin, exhibited significant inhibitory activities against dengue virus. This group of flavonoids, flavonol, could be investigated further to discover the common mechanisms of inhibition of dengue virus replication.","publish_time":"2011-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zandi, Keivan; Teoh, Boon-Teong; Sam, Sing-Sin; Wong, Pooi-Fong; Mustafa, Mohd Rais; AbuBakar, Sazaly","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6652151e876145926c6b4c6d683346811588bdfa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3271998.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22201648/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs1OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Daidzein","Hesperetin"],"organizations":["DENV","Foci Forming Unit Reduction Assay"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DENV replication","dengue virus replication","significant anti-DENV","\u03BCg","significant inhibition of DENV","virus infection","virus adsorption","dengue virus type","quercetin","weak anti-dengue activity","different stages of DENV","antiviral activity","significant inhibitory activities","Naringin","Hesperetin","Daidzein","group of bioflavonoids","findings","anti-adsorption effects","replication cycle","SI values","related SI","half maximal inhibitory concentration","FFURA","Foci","Unit Reduction Assay","RNA levels","RESULTS","infected cells","common mechanisms of inhibition","days post-infection","ratio of cytotoxic concentration","present study","group of flavonoids","quantitative RT-PCR","qRT-PCR assays","Selectivity Index value","plant-derived polyphenolic compounds","types of bioflavonoid","fisetin","potential health benefits","disease","major mosquito","vaccine available","BACKGROUND","flavonol","antivirals","CONCLUSION","Vero cell","Effort"],"language":"en"},

Of the cases that have sought care thus far in the region, more than 70,000 have been reported out of Colombia. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we use nontraditional digital disease surveillance data via HealthMap and Google Trends to develop near real-time estimates for the basic (R(0)) and observed (R(obs)) reproductive numbers associated with Zika virus disease in Colombia. We then validate our results against traditional health care-based disease surveillance data. METHODS: Cumulative reported case counts of Zika virus disease in Colombia were acquired via the HealthMap digital disease surveillance system. Linear smoothing was conducted to adjust the shape of the HealthMap cumulative case curve using Google search data. Traditional surveillance data on Zika virus disease were obtained from weekly Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) epidemiological bulletin publications. The Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model was used to estimate R(0) and R(obs) for both data sources. RESULTS: Using the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data, we estimated a mean R(0) of 2.56 (range 1.42-3.83) and a mean R(obs) of 1.80 (range 1.42-2.30). The traditional (INS) data yielded a mean R(0) of 4.82 (range 2.34-8.32) and a mean R(obs) of 2.34 (range 1.60-3.31). CONCLUSIONS: Although modeling using the traditional (INS) data yielded higher R(0) estimates than the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data, modeled ranges for R(obs) were comparable across both data sources. As a result, the narrow range of possible case projections generated by the traditional (INS) data was largely encompassed by the wider range produced by the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data. Thus, in the absence of traditional surveillance data, digital surveillance data can yield similar estimates for key transmission parameters and should be utilized in other Zika virus-affected countries to assess outbreak dynamics in near real time.","publish_time":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Majumder, Maimuna S; Santillana, Mauricio; Mekaru, Sumiko R; McGinnis, Denise P; Khan, Kamran; Brownstein, John S","journal":"JMIR Public Health Surveill","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4909981.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.5814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27251981/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Trends","Google","Instituto Nacional de Salud"],"locations":["South America","Colombia"],"keyphrases":["digital surveillance data","data sources","mean R","nontraditional digital disease surveillance data","absence of traditional surveillance data","Google search data","higher R","traditional health care-based disease surveillance data","HealthMap digital disease surveillance system","obs","transmission of Zika virus","smoothed HealthMap","total reported cases of Zika virus disease","wider range","HealthMap cumulative case curve","Colombia","Cumulative reported case","narrow range of possible case projections","similar estimates","real-time estimates","countries","results","Google Trends","key transmission parameters","Salud","weekly Instituto Nacional","local vector","modeled ranges","reproductive numbers","Exponential Adjustment","IDEA","South America","shape","outbreak dynamics","epidemiological bulletin publications","Incidence Decay","paper","date","real time","METHODS","modeling","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","Linear smoothing","OBJECTIVE","region"],"language":"en"},

Thus recent decades have seen a most dramatic change with the emergence globally also of new viral infections \u2013 notably human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) \u2013 and the appearance of some other dangerous and sometimes lethal infections formerly seen mainly in, and reported from, resource\u2010poor areas especially in parts of Asia, Latin America and Africa. This study offers a brief update of the most salient new aspects of the important viral infections, especially those with known orofacial manifestations or other implications for oral health care.","publish_time":"2015-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scully, C; Samaranayake, LP","journal":"Oral Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/194f65647c481718c16b2556bf7eb02a05d34bc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167660.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/odi.12356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26179810/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","Latin America","Africa"],"keyphrases":["new viral infections","important viral infections","lethal infections","resource","human papillomaviruses","human immunodeficiency viruses","mucosal manifestations","animal vectors","salient new aspects","known orofacial manifestations","oral health care","parts of Asia","implications","rich countries","rash","malaise","fever","exanthema","close proximity","oncogenicity","emergence","brief update","increasing movements of peoples","unexpected consequences","Latin America","myalgia","range of movement","poor areas","HIV","globe","dramatic change","Africa","herpesviruses","enanthema","recent decades","Global warming","apparent benignity","appearance","study","mosquitoes","tropics"],"language":"en"},

The economic south is carrying a higher burden than those in the economic north. This raises questions about whether social preventions and biomedical preventions for infectious disease are given equal consideration, and about social institutions and structures that frame the debate about infectious disease. This article examines how institutionalized ways of talking about infectious disease reinforces, creates, and sustains health inequalities. METHODS: Critical discourse analysis was considered to be epistemologically and ontologically consistent with the aims and context of this study. RESULTS: The study examined three types of infectious disease: \u2022 Emerging infectious diseases/pathogens \u2022 Neglected tropical diseases \u2022 Vector-borne infections. Examination revealed that poverty is the most common determinant of all three. CONCLUSIONS: A sustainable reduction in infectious disease in the southern countries is most likely to be achieved through tackling socioeconomic determinants. There is a need for a change in the discourse on infectious disease, and adopt a discourse that promotes self-determination, rather than one that reinforces the hero-victim scenario and power inequalities.","publish_time":"2020-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mabhala, Mzwandile A.; Yohannes, Asmait; Massey, Alan; Reid, John A.","journal":"Int J Prev Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187553.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363024/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpvm.ijpvm_431_17","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["types of infectious disease","infectious disease threats","Emerging infectious diseases","power inequalities","socioeconomic inequalities","social preventions","poverty","study","health inequalities","tackling socioeconomic determinants","Critical discourse analysis","tropical diseases","biomedical preventions","social institutions","economic south","economic north","fundamental determinants of differences","vulnerability of societies","pathogens","equal consideration","higher burden","sustainable reduction","southern countries","Vector","hero-victim scenario","structures","institutionalized ways","debate","change","aims","context","infections","METHODS","questions","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","article","common determinant","RESULTS","need","Examination","self-determination"],"language":"en"},

The two aims of this work were to assess the performances of SOFIA(\u00AE)RSV tests in \u201Creal-life-laboratory\u201D conditions (study 1) and implemented at point-of-care testing in a pediatric emergency department (ED, study 2), during two consecutive winter seasons. METHODS: In study 1, fresh nasopharyngeal swabs from patients of all ages were sampled in 1.5 ml of Universal virological Transport Medium (UTM) and prospectively tested using SOFIA(\u00AE)RSV tests. In study 2, conducted in a pediatric ED, nasopharyngeal swabs were placed in 3 ml of UTM. All SOFIA(\u00AE)RSV tests were confirmed by molecular testing, considered as reference method. The epidemiological and clinical features of tested patients, as well as the care of these patients after obtaining quick results were evaluated. RESULTS: The sensitivities of SOFIA(\u00AE)RSV in infants (aged under 24 months) performed in the laboratory and in the pediatric ED were respectively 95% (95% CI: 86.8\u201398.1) and 74.8% (95% CI: 68.0\u201380.9) compared to PCR. In study 1, the sensitivity among children (from 2 to 15 years old) and adults (above 15 years old) dropped to 45% (95% CI: 23.1\u201368.5) and 59% (95% CI: 32.9\u201381.6), respectively. In study 2, there were some differences in bed-management of SOFIA(\u00AE)RSV positive compared to SOFIA(\u00AE)RSV negative infants. CONCLUSIONS: SOFIA(\u00AE)RSV tests performed in the laboratory and in the pediatric ED show high and satisfactory sensitivities among young children under 24 months, which supports its robustness and reliability. However, the impact of these tests on patient care at point-of-care cannot be clearly assessed when considering the limits of the study 2 design.

In particular, it has been previously demonstrated, in specific populations, a role of particulate matter in worsening clinical presentation of virus infection in airways. Without prejudice to the ascertained virus spread by air droplets or contaminated surfaces, the factors that could have favored its spread remain to be investigated. Moreover, if these observations were to be confirmed, when the health emergency is resolved, it will be mandatory to redesign an economic-productive model in balance with the environment.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sciomer, Susanna; Moscucci, Federica; Magr\u00EC, Damiano; Badagliacca, Roberto; Piccirillo, Gianfranco; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe","journal":"Environ Monit Assess","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1632215729235f60b72cf58ce22df8f8f411cd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196178.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363409/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08317-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["spread","ascertained virus","possible efforts","health emergency","clinical presentation of virus infection","air droplets","recent epidemic","air pollution","current emergency","role of particulate matter","Italian health system","geographic areas","organization","contaminated surfaces","economic-productive model","new SARS-CoV","urgent need","infections","China","balance","etiopathogenetic data","serious attack","factors","airways","order","specific populations","northern regions of Italy","main outbreaks","environment","trend","prejudice","context","observations"],"language":"en"},

Upon enrolment, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for the real-time PCR detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B, influenza virus types A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus types 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, bocavirus, enterovirus, and paraechovirus; nasopharyngeal aspirates were also obtained to detect atypical bacteria. At least one infectious agent was identified in 76 children (89.4%). RSV was the most frequently detected pathogen and its prevalence was significantly higher than that of the other pathogens in both age groups, and significantly higher in the children aged 3\u201312 months than in those aged \u003C3 months. Only the children with RSV infection experienced recurrent wheezing. Viral load was significantly higher in children with than in those without recurrent wheezing. This study shows that RSV is the main reason for hospitalization during the first wheezing episode in infants, and that it appears to be the only pathogen associated with a high frequency of recurrences. A high viral load seems to be strictly related to the likelihood of recurrence.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bosis, S.; Esposito, S.; Niesters, H.G.M.; Zuccotti, G.V.; Marseglia, G.; Lanari, M.; Zuin, G.; Pelucchi, C.; Osterhaus, A.D.M.E.; Principi, N.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5584e191b98746da8be2927771b0e1512c627784.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5af93899e4fe0a7cc5e82d791b93d06fe03e5ffb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130007.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14621613; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14621613; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2008.02016.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18558940/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wheezing episode","children","recurrent wheezing","acute episode of wheezing","months","episode of severe acute wheezing","RSV infection","human coronavirus types","influenza virus types","parainfluenza viruses types","high viral load","high frequency of recurrences","human metapneumovirus","healthy infants","nasopharyngeal aspirates","nasopharyngeal swabs","infectious agents","detected pathogen","real-time PCR detection of respiratory syncytial virus","OC43","adenovirus","enterovirus","NL63","hospitalization","bocavirus","HKU1","paraechovirus","rhinovirus","main reason","order","pathogens","age groups","role","Italy","prevalence","patients","ABSTRACT","enrolment","study","atypical bacteria","likelihood of recurrence"],"language":"en"},

Here, we analysed further the mechanisms for this growth restriction of U\u2010type IHNV in RTG\u20102 cells, using strategies that assessed differences in viral genes, host immune regulation and phosphorylation. To determine whether the viral glycoprotein (G) or non\u2010virion (NV) protein was responsible for the growth restriction, four recombinant IHNV viruses were generated in which the G gene of an infectious IHNV clone was replaced by the G gene of U\u2010 or M\u2010type IHNV and the NV gene was replaced by NV of U\u2010 or M\u2010type IHNV. There was no significant difference in the growth of these recombinants in RTG\u20102 cells, indicating that G and NV proteins are not major factors responsible for the differential growth of the U\u2010 and M\u2010type strains. Poly I:C pretreatment of RTG\u20102 cells suppressed the growth of both U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNV, although the M virus continued to replicate at a reduced level. Both viruses induced type 1 interferon (IFN1) and the IFN1 stimulated gene Mx1, but the expression levels in M\u2010infected cells were significantly higher than in U\u2010infected cells and an inhibitor of the IFN1\u2010inducible protein kinase PKR, 2\u2010aminopurine (2\u2010AP), did not affect the growth of U\u2010 or M\u2010type IHNV in RTG\u20102 cells. These data did not indicate a role for the IFN1 system in the restricted growth of U\u2010type IHNV in RTG\u20102 cells. Prediction of kinase\u2010specific phosphorylation sites in the viral phosphoprotein (P) using the NetPhosK program revealed differences between U\u2010 and M\u2010type P genes at five phosphorylation sites. Pretreatment of RTG\u20102 cells with a PKC inhibitor or a p38MAPK inhibitor did not affect the growth of the U\u2010 and M\u2010type viruses. However, 100 \u03BCm of the casein kinase II (CKII) inhibitor, 5,6\u2010dichloro\u20101\u2010\u03B2\u2010d\u2010ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), reduced the titre of the U type 8.3\u2010fold at 24 h post\u2010infection. In contrast, 100 \u03BCm of the CKII inhibitor reduced the titre of the M type only 1.3\u2010fold at 48 h post\u2010infection. Our data suggest that the different growth of U\u2010 and M\u2010type IHNV in RTG\u20102 cells may be linked to a differential requirement for cellular protein kinases such as CKII for their growth.","publish_time":"2011-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, J W; Moon, C H; Harmache, A; Wargo, A R; Purcell, M K; Bremont, M; Kurath, G","journal":"J Fish Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d9c8b8fa31178c514cf5d470ed20ca9a6ebf157.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194290.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21241319/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2010.01225.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Poly"],"organizations":["NV","CKII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["U type","type IHNV","type viruses","restricted growth of U","growth restriction of U","NV of U","different growth of U","U genogroup type strain","type strains","G gene of U","differential growth","type P genes","infected cells","recombinant IHNV viruses","derived RTG","infectious IHNV clone","NV gene","CKII inhibitor","C pretreatment of RTG","genogroup type strain of infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus","PKC inhibitor","p38MAPK inhibitor","IFN1 system","viral genes","IFN1 stimulated gene Mx1","NV proteins","reduced level","rainbow trout","specific phosphorylation sites","viral phosphoprotein","inducible protein kinase PKR","viral glycoprotein","differences","fold","Prediction of kinase","casein kinase","reduced genome replication","h post\u2010infection","titre","\u03BCm","data","cellular protein kinases","differential requirement","major factors responsible","sockeye salmon","non\u2010virion","host immune regulation","expression levels","strategies","NetPhosK program","DRB","mRNA transcription","aminopurine","dichloro","recombinants","interferon","ribofuranosylbenzimidazole","role","Poly","mechanisms","significant difference","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) previously made available a tool for validating and annotating influenza virus sequences that is used to check submissions to GenBank. Before this project, there was no analogous tool in use for non-influenza viral sequence submissions. We developed a system called VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) that validates and annotates viral sequences in GenBank submissions. The annotation system is based on the analysis of the input nucleotide sequence using models built from curated RefSeqs. Hidden Markov models are used to classify sequences by determining the RefSeq they are most similar to, and feature annotation from the RefSeq is mapped based on a nucleotide alignment of the full sequence to a covariance model. Predicted proteins encoded by the sequence are validated with nucleotide-to-protein alignments using BLAST. The system identifies 43 types of \u201Calerts\u201D that (unlike the previous BLAST-based system) provide deterministic and rigorous feedback to researchers who submit sequences with unexpected characteristics. VADR has been integrated into GenBank\u2019s submission processing pipeline allowing for viral submissions passing all tests to be accepted and annotated automatically, without the need for any human (GenBank indexer) intervention. Unlike the previous submission-checking system, VADR is freely available (https://github.com/nawrockie/vadr) for local installation and use. VADR has been used for Norovirus submissions since May 2018 and for Dengue virus submissions since January 2019. Other viruses with high numbers of submissions will be added incrementally. VADR improves the speed with which non-flu virus submissions to GenBank can be checked and improves the content and quality of the GenBank annotations. The availability and portability of the software allow researchers to run the GenBank checks prior to submitting their viral sequences, and thereby gain confidence that their submissions will be accepted immediately without the need to correspond with GenBank staff. Reciprocally, the adoption of VADR frees GenBank staff to spend more time on services other than checking routine viral sequence submissions.","publish_time":"2019-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00E4ffer, Alejandro A; Hatcher, Eneida L; Yankie, Linda; Shonkwiler, Lara; Brister, J Rodney; Karsch-Mizrachi, Ilene; Nawrocki, Eric P","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8367c21d603a58c206ae740debdb10099f84f198.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0774ff63145f630e61f694f253c28b615c8d1a3d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/852657","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GenBank","VADR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GenBank submissions","viral submissions","viral sequences","routine viral sequence submissions","GenBank staff","Norovirus submissions","non-influenza viral sequence submissions","GenBank indexer","GenBank checks","GenBank annotations","Dengue virus submissions","non-flu virus submissions","annotation system","high numbers of submissions","Viral Annotation DefineR","adoption of VADR","input nucleotide sequence","annotating influenza virus sequences","previous BLAST-based system","researchers","previous submission","nucleotide alignment","feature annotation","need","analogous tool","Hidden Markov models","GenBank\u2019s submission processing pipeline","NCBI","rigorous feedback","services","analysis","speed","Biotechnology Information","National Center","software","human","time","curated RefSeqs","portability","local installation","protein alignments","content","quality","intervention","viruses","alerts","unexpected characteristics","confidence","availability","project","covariance model","Predicted proteins","types","tests"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The International Study of Wheezing in Infants (EISL) is a large population\u2010based cross\u2010sectional study carried out in Latin America (LA) and Europe (EU). We used a validated questionnaire for identifying wheeze in the first year of life. The questionnaire also inquired about pneumonia diagnosis, together with other potentially related factors. Associations between both conditions and between potential risk/protective factors for pneumonia were tested by random\u2010effects logit model and adjusting for all factors found previously associated to RW in this cohort. RESULTS: Pneumonia and RW were strongly associated to each other in LA and EU (aOR 5.42; 95%CI: 4.87\u20136.04 and aOR 13.99; 95%CI: 9.61\u201320.36, respectively). Infant eczema was the most consistent risk factor of pneumonia in both continents, in the whole population and also among wheezers and non\u2010wheezers (aOR ranging from 1.30; 95%CI: 1.11\u20131.52 to 2.65; 95%CI: 1.68\u20134.18); while breast feeding for at least 3 months was the most consistent protective factor (aOR ranging from 0.60; 95%CI: 0.51\u20130.71 to 0.76; 95%CI: 0.69\u20130.84). Factors associated to pneumonia were similar between continents among wheezers, but differed considerably among non\u2010wheezers. CONCLUSION: Pneumonia and RW are associated conditions sharing many risk/protective factors in EU and LA among wheezing infants, but not among non\u2010wheezing infants. The association between pneumonia and RW could be due to shared pathophysiology or by diagnostic confusion between the two conditions.

This is well exemplified by several recent epidemics such as those of Nipah, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian flu, Ebola, Monkeypox, and Hantaviruses. After the initial interspecies transmission per se, the viruses can disseminate into the human population through various and distinct mechanisms. Some of them are well characterized and understood, thus allowing a certain level of risk control and prevention. Surprisingly and in contrast, the initial steps that lead to the emergence of several viruses, and of their associated diseases, remain still poorly understood. Epidemiological field studies conducted in certain specific high-risk populations are thus necessary to obtain new insights into the early events of this emergence process. Human infections by simian viruses represent increasing public health concerns. Indeed, by virtue of their genetic and physiological similarities, non-human primates (NHPs) are considered to be likely the sources of viruses that can infect humans and thus may pose a significant threat to human population. This is well illustrated by retroviruses, which have the ability to cross species, adapt to a new host and sometimes spread within these new species. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies have thus clearly showed that the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 in humans have resulted from several independent interspecies transmissions of different SIV types from Chimpanzees and African monkeys (including sooty mangabeys), respectively, probably during the first part of the last century. The situation for Human T cell Lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is, for certain aspects, quite comparable. Indeed, the origin of most HTLV-1 subtypes appears to be linked to interspecies transmission between STLV-1-infected monkeys and humans, followed by variable periods of evolution in the human host. In this review, after an introduction on emerging viruses, we will briefly present the results of a large epidemiological study performed in groups of Bantus and Pygmies living in villages and settlements located in the rain forest of the South region of Cameroon. These populations are living nearby the habitats of several monkeys and apes, often naturally infected by different retroviruses including SIV, STLV and simian foamy virus. Most of the persons included in this study were hunters of such NHPs, thus at high risk of contact with infected body fluids (blood, saliva,...) during hunting activities. After reviewing the current available data on the discovery, cross-species transmission from monkeys and apes to humans of the simian foamy retroviruses, we will report the results of our study. Such infection is a unique natural model to study the different mechanisms of restriction of retroviral emergence in Humans.","publish_time":"2013-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gessain, Antoine","journal":"Bulletin de l\u0027Acad\u00E9mie Nationale de M\u00E9decine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3518eb7c947c64173a54071679570821a4c3771e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407919313871; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407919313871","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIV","Human T"],"locations":["South","Cameroon"],"keyphrases":["humans","human population","human host","Human infections","simian viruses","infected monkeys","new species","emergence of human immunodeficiency virus type","non-human primates","different retroviruses","emerging viruses","sources of viruses","cross-species transmission","simian foamy virus","initial interspecies transmission","simian foamy retroviruses","large epidemiological study","Human T cell Lymphotropic virus type","African monkeys","retroviral emergence","emergence process","new host","various animal species","different mechanisms of restriction","STLV","NHPs","apes","certain aspects","HIV","new insights","HTLV","results","independent interspecies transmissions of different SIV types","certain specific high-risk populations","certain level of risk control","infected body fluids","Epidemiological field studies","distinct mechanisms","phylogenetic studies","initial steps","high risk of contact","large proportion of viral pathogens","Avian flu","Chimpanzees","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","physiological similarities","Nipah","Ebola","saliva","discovery","rain forest","blood","groups of Bantus","early events","situation","unique natural model","variable periods of evolution","public health concerns","settlements","villages","Pygmies","Monkeypox","SUMMARY","prevention","South region of Cameroon","current available data","sooty mangabeys","significant threat","recent epidemics","virtue","Sequence comparison","introduction","subtypes","hunters","habitats","review","hunting activities","Hantaviruses","origin","contrast","persons","associated diseases","ability","decades","century"],"language":"en"},

While the medical research area dedicates efforts to find cures and remedies to counteract the effects of a virus, the engineering area is involved in providing risk assessments in indoor environments by simulating the airborne transmission of the virus during an epidemic. To this end, virus air emission data are needed. Unfortunately, this information is usually available only after the outbreak, based on specific reverse engineering cases. In this work, a novel approach to estimate the viral load emitted by a contagious subject on the basis of the viral load in the mouth, the type of respiratory activity (e.g. breathing, speaking, whispering), respiratory physiological parameters (e.g. inhalation rate), and activity level (e.g. resting, standing, light exercise) is proposed. The results showed that high quanta emission rates (\u003E100 quanta h(-1)) can be reached by an asymptomatic infectious SARS-CoV-2 subject performing vocalization during light activities (i.e. walking slowly) whereas a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in resting conditions mostly has a low quanta emission rate (\u003C1 quantum h(-1)). The findings in terms of quanta emission rates were then adopted in infection risk models to demonstrate its application by evaluating the number of people infected by an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in Italian indoor microenvironments before and after the introduction of virus containment measures. The results obtained from the simulations clearly highlight that a key role is played by proper ventilation in containment of the virus in indoor environments.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buonanno, G.; Stabile, L.; Morawska, L.","journal":"Environ Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4a953720f38e0eaab15865873b92b2e27099578.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211635.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0160412020312800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416374/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412020312800?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105794","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quanta h","low quanta emission rate","terms of quanta emission rates","high quanta emission rates","virus air emission data","asymptomatic SARS-CoV","contagious subject","indoor environments","asymptomatic infectious SARS-CoV","introduction of virus containment measures","viral load","engineering area","Airborne transmission","results","epidemic","Italian indoor microenvironments","type of respiratory activity","inhalation rate","risk assessments","key role","resting conditions","quantum h","activity level","light activities","light exercise","respiratory physiological parameters","infection risk models","medical research area","specific reverse engineering cases","efforts","cures","application","mouth","proper ventilation","outbreak","novel approach","effects","basis","end","vocalization","findings","number of people","remedies","scientific literature","whispering","simulations","pathway of contagion","evidence","work","context","information"],"language":"en"},

For the iPCR, detection of the sandwich formed by the complexation of capture antibody\u2010antigen\u2010detection antibody was performed by qPCR thanks to the substitution of peroxydase by a chimeric DNA. This modification increased the detection sensitivity 200\u2010fold compared to ELISA.

This step was not necessary in the iPCR workflow, avoiding this drawback. The losses of viral particles occurred at the elution step from the stool only. The recovery rate of the iPCR was thus better and ranged between 21 and 54%. As a result, iPCR enabled the detection of lower virus concentrations in stool samples compared to those detected by ELISA and qPCR.

Complete sequencing of the human genome highlighted the presence of \u223C300 000 sequences that can potentially form G4s.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that adaptation is a result of alterations intrinsic to epithelial cells or to the cells and their matrix, and not due to systemic or neural influences. Rats were preexposed to either filtered air (FA) or 0.96 ppm O3 for 8 hr/night for 60 days, and then their tracheae were removed and exposed to 3 ppm O3 in an explant culture system where behavioral, nasal, exudative, and secretory product influences can be eliminated. After exposure to 3 ppm O3 in vitro, quantitative electron microscopic evaluation demonstrated that the epithelia from the FA preexposure group had significantly more necrotic cells and sloughed cells and fewer ciliated cells than the epithelia from the O3 preexposure group. Thus previous exposure to ozone in vivo induces a change in tracheal epithelium which confers resistance to ozone-induced injury in the explant exposure system.","publish_time":"1988-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nikula, Kristen J.; Wilson, Dennis W.; Dungworth, Donald L.; Plopper, Charles G.","journal":"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33db094e90e39f558529c568e0d0e373fe21bf7b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0041008X88900427; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0041008X88900427","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epithelial cells","ppm O3","necrotic cells","sloughed cells","fewer ciliated cells","presence of ciliated cells","O3 preexposure group","explant exposure system","previous exposure","tracheal epithelium of rats","cell populations","prolonged ozone","FA preexposure group","increased cell turnover","altered characteristics of epithelial secretory cell products","explant culture system","ozone-induced injury","secretory product influences","Abstract Adaptation","neural influences","elevated tracheal superoxide dismutase activity","nasal","exudative","resistance","quantitative electron microscopic evaluation","result of alterations intrinsic","change","uniform short cilia","hr","night","filtered air","days","hypothesis","study","matrix","purpose","tracheae"],"language":"en"},

The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. To understand the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. This study presents an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. The proposed method serves an effective tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their global and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yin, Changchuan","journal":"Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c701a646388001f1863aaa1d9e8d790277430bce.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353474/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754320303189?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0888754320303189; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.04.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["genotyping SARS-CoV","genotyping analysis of SARS","transmission of SARS","genome isolates","relationship of virus isolates","specific multiple mutations","accurate method","proposed method","frequent mutations","global public health","epidemic of pathogenic viruses","RNA primase","RNA polymerase","disease control","emerging global infectious COVID","critical threats","current epidemic","reference genome","multiple sequence alignments","various pathways of evolution","novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","predominated mutation type","S proteins","genotypes","monitoring","nucleoprotein","vaccine development","genes","globe","effective tool","SNP","economy","local genetic variations","single-nucleotide polymorphism","Jaccard distances","complete genomes","great importance","study","China"],"language":"en"},

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. METHODS: We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23\u201324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). FINDINGS: In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2\u00B768 (95% CrI 2\u00B747\u20132\u00B786) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304\u2013130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6\u00B74 days (95% CrI 5\u00B78\u20137\u00B71). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227\u2013805), 113 (57\u2013193), 98 (49\u2013168), 111 (56\u2013191), and 80 (40\u2013139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1\u20132 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. Objective To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. Results Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 \u00D7 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized.

We also study how the 2016 opening of four new light rail stations, and how more community-based policing starting in late 2018, impacted crime. A series of statistical analyses are performed on reclassified (larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property) and non-reclassified crimes by probing publicly available databases from 2006 to 2019. We compare data before and after passage of Proposition 47, city-wide and within eight neighborhoods. Similar analyses are conducted within a 450 meter radius of the new transit stations. Reports of monthly reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. The reported incidence of larceny intensified throughout the city. Two new train stations, including Downtown, reported significant crime increases in their vicinity after service began. While the number of reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, those not affected by the new law decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 strongly impacted crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new policing measures that enhanced outreach and patrolling. These findings may be relevant to law enforcement and policy-makers. Follow-up studies needed to confirm long-term trends may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that drastically changed societal conditions.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crodelle, Jennifer; Vallejo, Celeste; Schmidtchen, Markus; Topaz, Chad M.; D\u0027Orsogna, Maria R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/894750b50fafd9c7c9523d8682481de4f287bf96.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14423v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Santa Monica"],"keyphrases":["passage of Proposition","new law","non-reclassified crimes","new transit stations","new train stations","significant crime","impacted crime","enactment of Proposition","Reports of monthly reclassified crimes","new light rail stations","crime patterns","reported incidence of larceny","adoption of new policing measures","Santa Monica","Downtown","law enforcement","significant drop","Similar analyses","community-based policing","series of statistical analyses","California","forgery","fraud","stolen property","possession of narcotics","meter radius","outreach","long-term trends","policy-makers","available databases","pandemic","non-violent felonies","Follow-up studies","findings","patrolling","initiative","vicinity","largest overall surge","societal conditions","misdemeanors","COVID","city","service","number","neighborhoods"],"language":"en"},

Our model at the core is a non-local generalization of the widely used Kermack-McKendrick(KM) model where the susceptible(S) population evolves into two other categories, namely infectives(I) and removed(R). This is the well-known SIR model in which we further divide both S and I into high and low risk categories. We first formulate a set of non-local dynamical equations for the time evolution of distinct population distributions under this categorization in an attempt to describe the general scenario of infectious disease progression. We then solve the non-linear coupled differential equations-(i) numerically by the method of propagation, and (ii) a more flexible and versatile cellular automata (CA) simulation which provides a coarse-grained description of the generalized non-local model. In order to account for multiple factors such as role of spreaders before containment, we introduce a time dependent rate which appears to be essential to explain the sudden spikes before the plateau observed in many cases (for example like China). We demonstrate how this generalized approach allows us to handle the effects of (i) time-dependence of the rate-constants of spread, (ii) different population density, (iii) the age ratio, (iv) quarantine, (v) lockdown, and (vi) social distancing. Our study allows us to make certain predictions regarding the nature of spread with respect to several external parameters, treated as control variables. Analysis of the model clearly shows that due to the strong heterogeneity in the epidemic process originating from the distribution of initial infectives, the theory must be local in character but at the same time connect to a global perspective.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mukherjee, Saumyak; Mondal, Sayantan; Bagchi, Biman","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17273973f7bff235b8913b5e263dc7a83eb87adf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14787v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["generalized non-local model","time evolution of population","generalized mathematical model","time-dependence","well-known SIR model","non-local generalization","time dependent rate","time evolution of distinct population distributions","set of non-local dynamical equations","different population density","generalized approach","study","infectious diseases","rate-constants","distribution of initial infectives","low risk categories","non-linear coupled differential equations","general scenario of infectious disease progression","simulation","coarse-grained description","versatile cellular automata","theory","epidemic process","external parameters","multiple factors","role of spreaders","attempt","categorization","containment","core","cases","quarantine","plateau","nature","sudden spikes","respect","control variables","strong heterogeneity","certain predictions","recent COVID","Kermack-McKendrick","character","age ratio","lockdown","example","China","pandemic","order","effects","global perspective","social distancing","method of propagation","Analysis"],"language":"en"},

It is confirmed that this virus has taken over 126,607 lives until today. Since the beginning of its spreading, many Artificial Intelligence researchers developed systems and methods for predicting the virus\u0027s behavior or detecting the infection. One of the possible ways of determining the patient infection to COVID-19 is through analyzing the chest X-ray images. As there are a large number of patients in hospitals, it would be time-consuming and difficult to examine lots of X-ray images, so it can be very useful to develop an AI network that does this job automatically. In this paper, we have trained several deep convolutional networks with the introduced training techniques for classifying X-ray images into three classes: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19, based on two open-source datasets. Unfortunately, most of the previous works on this subject have not shared their dataset, and we had to deal with few data on covid19 cases. Our data contains 180 X-ray images that belong to persons infected to COVID-19, so we tried to apply methods to achieve the best possible results. In this research, we introduce some training techniques that help the network learn better when we have few cases of COVID-19, and also we propose a neural network that is a concatenation of Xception and ResNet50V2 networks. This network achieved the best accuracy by utilizing multiple features extracted by two robust networks. In this paper, despite some other researches, we have tested our network on 11302 images to report the actual accuracy our network can achieve in real circumstances.

As a disease begins to spread in the population, information about the disease is transmitted to others, which in turn has an effect on the spread of disease. In this paper, using empirical results of the propagation of H7N9 and information about the disease, we clearly show that the spreading dynamics of the two-types of processes influence each other. We build a mathematical model in which both types of spreading dynamics are described using the SIS process in order to illustrate the influence of information diffusion on epidemic spreading. Both the simulation results and the pairwise analysis reveal that information diffusion can increase the threshold of an epidemic outbreak, decrease the final fraction of infected individuals and significantly decrease the rate at which the epidemic propagates. Additionally, we find that the multi-outbreak phenomena of epidemic spreading, along with the impact of information diffusion, is consistent with the empirical results. These findings highlight the requirement to maintain social awareness of diseases even when the epidemics seem to be under control in order to prevent a subsequent outbreak. These results may shed light on the in-depth understanding of the interplay between the dynamics of epidemic spreading and information diffusion.","publish_time":"2015-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhan, Xiu-Xiu; Liu, Chuang; Zhou, Ge; Zhang, Zi-Ke; Sun, Gui-Quan; Zhu, Jonathan J.

Assuming the challenge to link the typed content of a target user in a pool of candidate profiles, our results show that keystroke recognition can be used to reduce the list of candidate profiles by more than 90%. In addition, when keystroke is combined with auxiliary data (such as location), our system achieves a Rank-1 identification performance equal to 52.6% and 10.9% for a background candidate list composed of 1K and 100K profiles, respectively.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morales, Aythami; Acien, Alejandro; Fierrez, Julian; Monaco, John V.; Tolosana, Ruben; Vera-Rodriguez, Ruben; Ortega-Garcia, Javier","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/228a9fc3d075614e10ea02a619a0e4e899569371.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07688v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["keystroke recognition","typed content","list of candidate profiles","pool of candidate profiles","malicious content","context of content de-anonymization","keystroke biometric recognition","use of keystroke biometrics","Behavioral biometrics","background candidate list","fight","massive spread of fake news","powerful tools","proactive identification","proposed system","typed sequences","behavioral typing patterns","identification performance equal","target user","public opinion","Recurrent Neural Networks","COVID","results","governments","anonymity","users","pandemic","experiments","Rank","multiple accounts","ability","latest advances","companies","major events","location","blacklisting","auxiliary data","Internet","missinformation","challenge","addition"],"language":"en"},

This question is answered by using a novel method to identify shocks to uncertainty in access to credit.

Using state-dependent local projections, we find that the\u0022pure\u0022effect by itself generates a sharp slowdown in real activity and the effects are largely countercyclical. We feed the estimated shocks into a flexible price real business cycle model with a collateral constraint and show that when the collateral constraint binds, an uncertainty shock about credit access is recessionary leading to a simultaneous decline in consumption, investment, and output.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chatterjee, Pratiti; Gunawan, David; Kohn, Robert","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46a754b0d5d5e84a9ce8cf34bc6a9e69376149d4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14719v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Markov Chain Monte Carlo"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["uncertainty shock","credit availability","credit access","time-varying credit uncertainty","captures total effects of uncertainty","real activity","estimated shocks","moment","collateral constraint binds","sharp slowdown","Time-variation","flexible price real business cycle model","simultaneous decline","consumption","particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo","investment","novel method","state-dependent local projections","output","question","parts"],"language":"en"},

We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking into account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters determined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is capable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumulated number of confirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The drastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different countries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as the duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the occurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating its reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that insufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented infection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that country. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model predicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did not impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is that, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a non-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been deemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently imposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving into a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting the necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the hidden individuals.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Long, Yong-Shang; Zhai, Zheng-Meng; Han, Li-Lei; Kang, Jie; Li, Yi-Lin; Lin, Zhao-Hua; Zeng, Lang; Wu, Da-Yu; Hao, Chang-Qing; Tang, Ming; Liu, Zonghua; Lai, Ying-Cheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea0747bdc156ec16371aff66b28bf39f57104318.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12028v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","South Korea","Iran","United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["Model prediction","state model","COVID","role of undocumented infection","government reports","strict government actions","percentage of undocumented infection","large fraction of undocumented infection","insufficient government action","accurate prediction","Italy","real-time prediction","data","long-term epidemic","country","catastrophic epidemic scenarios","large variations","strict travel","important role","disparate testing","key parameters","universal testing","key finding","hidden individuals","non-negligible hidden population","policies","threshold","diagnostic standards","different countries","daily accumulated number of confirmed cases","novel coronavirus","South Korea","United Kingdom","estimated parameter values","community disease","China","Iran","little effect","occurrence time","real possibility","uncertainties","duration","unique features","necessity","social distancing restrictions","account","high mortality","Tests","likelihood of future outbreaks","mathematical optimization","inflection","spreading","urgent problem","reliability","robustness"],"language":"en"},

For better prediction of the dynamics of a particular disease, it is important to adopt the most suitable model.

Different from the existing Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) based virus transmission models, which fits well for pandemic modeling with sufficient historical data, the new model, which is also SEIR based, uses short history data to find the trend of the changing disease dynamics for the infected, the dead and the recovered so that it can naturally accommodate the adaptive real-time changes of disease mitigation, business activity and social behavior of populations. As the parameters of the improved SEIR models are trained by short history window data for accurate trend prediction, our differential epidemic model, essentially are window-based time-varying SEIR model.

Once a model has been calibrated, it can be used as a forecasting tool to make predictions and to evaluate contingency plans. It is customary to employ only point estimators for such predictions. However, some models may fit the same data reasonably well for a broad range of parameter values, and this flexibility means that predictions stemming from such models will vary widely, depending on the particular parameter values employed within the range that give a good fit. When data are poor or incomplete, model uncertainty widens further. A way to circumvent this problem is to use Bayesian statistics to incorporate observations and use the full range of parameter estimates contained in the posterior distribution to adjust for uncertainties in model predictions. Specifically, given the epidemiological model and a probability distribution for observations, we use the posterior distribution of model parameters to generate all possible epidemiological curves via the posterior predictive distribution. From the envelope of all curves one can extract the worst-case scenario and study the impact of implementing contingency plans according to this assessment. We apply this approach to the potential evolution of COVID-19 in Mexico City and assess whether contingency plans are being successful and whether the epidemiological curve has flattened.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mena, Rams\u0027es H.; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X.; Mantilla-Beniers, Natalia B.; Carranco-Sapi\u0027ens, Gabriel A.; Benet, Luis; Boyer, Denis; Castillo, Isaac P\u0027erez","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0652bad850400bce6b777fbf2eac89c068fe304.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02294v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mexico City"],"keyphrases":["model predictions","posterior distribution of model parameters","Epidemiological models","model uncertainty","contingency plans","posterior predictive distribution","probability distribution","possible epidemiological curves","range of parameter estimates","broad range of parameter values","particular parameter values","data","available observations","set of parameters","good fit","Mexico City","potential evolution of COVID","impact","uncertainties","problem","approach","worst-case scenario","Bayesian statistics","flexibility","estimators","forecasting tool","assessment","way","envelope"],"language":"en"},

Although a quantitative methodology for their identification is still missing, the phenomenon of echo chambers is widely debated both at scientific and political level. To shed light on this issue, we introduce an operational definition of echo chambers and perform a massive comparative analysis on more than 1B pieces of contents produced by 1M users on four social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Gab. We infer the leaning of users about controversial topics - ranging from vaccines to abortion - and reconstruct their interaction networks by analyzing different features, such as shared links domain, followed pages, follower relationship and commented posts. Our method quantifies the existence of echo-chambers along two main dimensions: homophily in the interaction networks and bias in the information diffusion toward likely-minded peers. We find peculiar differences across social media. Indeed, while Facebook and Twitter present clear-cut echo chambers in all the observed dataset, Reddit and Gab do not. Finally, we test the role of the social media platform on news consumption by comparing Reddit and Facebook. Again, we find support for the hypothesis that platforms implementing news feed algorithms like Facebook may elicit the emergence of echo-chambers.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cinelli, Matteo; Morales, Gianmarco De Francisci; Galeazzi, Alessandro; Quattrociocchi, Walter; Starnini, Michele","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ae13ff2b6ea986dae80a0db3e3d6a284eb8b050.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09603v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Reddit","Gab"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phenomenon of echo chambers","Facebook","operational definition of echo chambers","emergence of echo","existence of echo","Twitter present clear-cut echo chambers","Reddit","social media platforms","information diffusion","interaction networks","online users","leaning of users","Gab","news consumption","shared narrative","news feed algorithms","shared links domain","pages","follower relationship","different features","observed dataset","hypothesis","bias","massive comparative analysis","controversial topics","likely-minded peers","main dimensions","commented posts","abortion","B pieces of contents","identification","issue","vaccines","Recent studies","system of beliefs","peculiar differences","role","quantitative methodology","political level","support","groups","light"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a new forecasting model is presented to analyze and forecast the CS of COVID-19 for the coming days based on the reported data since 22 Jan 2020. The proposed forecasting model, named ISACL-MFNN, integrates an improved interior search algorithm (ISA) based on chaotic learning (CL) strategy into a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MFNN). The ISACL incorporates the CL strategy to enhance the performance of ISA and avoid the trapping in the local optima. By this methodology, it is intended to train the neural network by tuning its parameters to optimal values and thus achieving high-accuracy level regarding forecasted results. The ISACL-MFNN model is investigated on the official data of the COVID-19 reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze the confirmed cases for the upcoming days. The performance regarding the proposed forecasting model is validated and assessed by introducing some indices including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the comparisons with other optimization algorithms are presented.

However, several studies document that this distinction is too simple. The aim of the present study is to give an overview of counting methods in the bibliometric literature and to provide insight into their properties and use. A mix of methods is used. In the preliminary results, a literature review covering 1970-2018 identified 29 original counting methods. Seventeen were introduced in the period 2010-2018. Twenty-one of the 29 counting methods are rank-dependent and fractionalized meaning that the authors of a publications share 1 credit but do not receive equal shares, for example harmonic counting. The internal and external validation of the counting methods are assessed.

In this paper, we demonstrate how fiber-optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) connected to a telecommunication cable beneath Palo Alto, CA captured seismic and geodetic signals produced by vehicles during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and subsequent quarantine. We utilize DAS strain measurements of roadbed deformation caused by local cars and trucks in an automatic template matching detection algorithm to count the number of vehicles traveling per day over a two-month period around the timing of the San Francisco Bay Area shelter-in-place order. Using a segment of the optical fiber near a major grocery store on Sand Hill Road we find a 50% decrease in vehicle count immediately following the order, but data from near Stanford Hospital showed a far more subtle change due to on-going hospital activities. We compare the information derived from DAS measurements to other quarantine response metrics and find a strong correlation with the relative changes reported by Google and Apple using mobile phone data.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindsey, Nathaniel J.; Yuan, Siyuan; Lellouch, Ariel; Gualtieri, Lucia; Lecocq, Thomas; Biondi, Biondo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/329eddefd0bc6965ea76be5b16e0b355c5e6be6a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04861v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DAS","Google","Apple"],"locations":["San Francisco Bay Area"],"keyphrases":["DAS measurements","real-time measurements","information","mobile phone data","subsequent quarantine","DAS strain measurements of roadbed deformation","quarantine response metrics","mobile phone locations","near Stanford Hospital","fiber-optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing","grocery stores","government officials","optical fiber","pandemic outbreak","number of vehicles","recent COVID","place order","major grocery store","dense distributed geophysical sensing of ground motions","future government decisions","on-going hospital activities","trucks","community-level activity","automatic template matching detection algorithm","timing","San Francisco Bay Area shelter","local cars","viral infection rates","use of roads","Google","Apple","Palo Alto","strong correlation","subtle change","relative changes","Sand Hill Road","geodetic signals","telecommunication cable","public infrastructure","day","citizens","city","hospitals","homes","world","month period","segment","paper"],"language":"en"},

In-network caching function in ICN plays an important role to achieve the design motivation. However, many researchers on in-network caching have focused on where to cache rather than how to cache: the former is known as contents deployment in the network and the latter is known as cache replacement in an ICN element. Although, the cache replacement has been intensively researched in the context of web-caching and content delivery network previously, the conventional approaches cannot be directly applied to ICN due to the fine granularity of cacheable items in ICN, which eventually changes the access patterns. In this paper, we argue that ICN requires a novel cache replacement algorithm to fulfill the requirements in the design of high performance ICN element. Then, we propose a novel cache replacement algorithm to satisfy the requirements named Compact CLOCK with Adaptive Replacement (Compact CAR), which can reduce the consumption of cache memory to one-tenth compared to conventional approaches.","publish_time":"2016-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ooka, Atsushi; Eum, Suyong; Ata, Shingo; Murata, Masayuki","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2def22f387794a0a8bc75678132663f4d253d39c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02603v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICN","Adaptive Replacement"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel cache replacement algorithm","Adaptive Replacement","network caching function","consumption of cache memory","content delivery network","design of high performance ICN element","network research communities","requirements","conventional approaches","Compact CLOCK","Compact CAR","design motivation","capability of efficient content dissemination","important role","attention","fine granularity of cacheable items","context of web","Information-centric networking","contents deployment","researchers","access patterns","paper"],"language":"en"},

Traditional lab-based methods will ultimately answer many of these questions but take considerable time. In silico modeling methods provide the opportunity to rapidly generate information on newly emerged pathogens to aid countermeasure development and also to predict potential future behaviors. We used a structural homology modeling approach to characterize the SARSCoV2 spike protein and predict its binding strength to the human ACE2 receptor. We then explored the possible transmission path by which SARSCoV2 might have crossed to humans by constructing models of ACE2 receptors of relevant species, and calculating the binding energy of SARSCoV2 spike protein to each. Notably, SARSCoV2 spike protein had the highest overall binding energy for human ACE2, greater than all the other tested species including bat, the postulated source of the virus. This indicates that SARSCoV2 is a highly adapted human pathogen. Of the species studied, the next highest binding affinity after human was pangolin, which is most likely explained by a process of convergent evolution. Binding of SARSCoV2 for dog and cat ACE2 was similar to affinity for bat ACE2, all being lower than for human ACE2, and is consistent with only occasional observations of infections of these domestic animals. Overall, the data indicates that SARSCoV2 is uniquely adapted to infect humans, raising questions as to whether it arose in nature by a rare chance event or whether its origins lie elsewhere.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piplani, Sakshi; Singh, Puneet Kumar; Winkler, David A.; Petrovsky, Nikolai","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bc7c77f00f5b46fea1d6ef83c44d7a58b687eef.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06199v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Binding of SARSCoV2","binding energy of SARSCoV2 spike protein","bat ACE2","human ACE2 receptor","cat ACE2","binding strength","highest binding affinity","humans","highest overall binding energy","adapted human pathogen","models of ACE2 receptors of relevant species","animal species","tested species","exotic animals","companion animals","domestic animals","origins","important questions","silico modeling methods","structural homology modeling approach","Traditional lab-based methods","zoonotic transfer","COVID19 pandemic","reasons","large variations","susceptibilities","mechanisms","dog","occasional observations of infections","countermeasure development","postulated source","emerged pathogens","reservoirs","rare chance event","commercial purposes","opportunity","SARS coronavirus","pangolin","potential future behaviors","information","nature","devastating impact","possible transmission path","process of convergent evolution","considerable time","data"],"language":"en"},

The pandemic has profoundly changed the world. Traditional methods for observing these historical events are difficult because sending reporters to areas with many infected people can put the reporters\u0027 lives in danger. New technologies are needed for safely observing responses to these policies. This paper reports using thousands of network cameras deployed worldwide for the purpose of witnessing activities in response to the policies. The network cameras can continuously provide real-time visual data (image and video) without human efforts. Thus, network cameras can be utilized to observe activities without risking the lives of reporters. This paper describes a project that uses network cameras to observe responses to governments\u0027 policies during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to April in 2020). The project discovers over 30,000 network cameras deployed in 110 countries. A set of computer tools are created to collect visual data from network cameras continuously during the pandemic.

Clear inference about peak timing is then possible. Further, inference about the earlier infection rate dynamics driving the death rate dynamics can be treated as a simple Bayesian inverse problem, which can be readily solved by imposing a smoothness assumption on the infection rate. This straightforward semi-parametric approach is substantially better founded than the running mean smoothers which generally form the basis for public debate. In the absence of direct statistically based measurement of infection rates, it also offers a usefully assumption-light approach to data analysis, for comparison with the results of the more assumption-rich process simulation models used to inform policy. An interesting result of the analysis is that it suggests that the number of new daily infections in the UK peaked some days before lock down was implemented, although it does not completely rule out a slightly later peak.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wood, Simon N.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25a214cd63f69f33402c6339146be0bc7ff0b7b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02090v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["death rate dynamics","underlying death rate","earlier infection rate dynamics","observed death","data analysis","assumption-light approach","smoothness assumption","assumption-rich process simulation models","Simple smooth additive models","based measurement of infection rates","Clear inference","peak timing","later peak","simple Bayesian inverse problem","straightforward semi-parametric approach","strong weekly pattern","basis","UK","number of new daily infections","absence of direct","results","comparison","series","policy","COVID","running mean smoothers","public debate","days","interesting result"],"language":"en"},

The history of the random growth process is often unobserved but contains important information such as the source of the infection. We consider the problem of statistical inference on aspects of the latent history using only a single snapshot of the final tree. Our approach is to apply random labels to the observed unlabeled tree and analyze the resulting distribution of the growth process, conditional on the final outcome. We show that this conditional distribution is tractable under a shape-exchangeability condition, which we introduce here, and that this condition is satisfied for many popular models for randomly growing trees such as uniform attachment, linear preferential attachment and uniform attachment on a $D$-regular tree. For inference of the root under shape-exchangeability, we propose computationally scalable algorithms for constructing confidence sets with valid frequentist coverage as well as bounds on the expected size of the confidence sets.

Existing tools for doing so rely on the collection of exact location information of individuals over lengthy time periods, and combining this information with other personal information.

We propose an alternative: an extremely simple scheme for providing fine-grained and timely alerts to users who have been in the close vicinity of an infected individual. Crucially, this is done while preserving the anonymity of all individuals, and without collecting or storing any personal information or location history. Our approach is based on using short-range communication mechanisms, like Bluetooth, that are available in all modern cell phones. It can be deployed with very little infrastructure, and incurs a relatively low false-positive rate compared to other collocation methods. We also describe a number of extensions and tradeoffs.

A matter of debate is the possible viral detection in different body fluids than respiratory droplets. Thus, we evaluated the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen and urine samples of a volunteer with confirmed COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 31-year-old man with fever, myalgia, anosmia, and ageusia was tested and found positive for SARS-CoV-2 through a pharyngeal swab. Eight days after he provided semen and urine samples in which viral RNA presence was measured using a Real time RT PCR system (RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, Altona Diagnostics) targeting E and S viral genes. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Semen and urine samples search for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative.

Owing to their extensive genetic diversity and high mutation rates, controlling ACoVs has become a challenge. In this context, the potential contribution of wild birds in the disease dynamics, especially in domesticated birds, remains largely unknown. In the present study, five hundred fifty-seven (n = 557) cloacal/fecal swabs were collected from four different wild bird species from eight Egyptian governorates during 2016 and a total of fourteen positive isolates were used for phylodynamics and evolutionary analysis. Genetic relatedness based on spike (S1) gene demonstrated the clustering of majority of these isolates where nine isolates grouped within Egy/variant 2 (IS/885 genotype) and five isolates clustered within Egy/variant 1 (IS/1494/06 genotype). Interestingly, these isolates showed noticeable genetic diversity and were clustered distal to the previously characterized Egy/variant 1 and Egy/variant 2 in Egyptian commercial poultry. The S1 gene based comparison of nucleotide identity percentages revealed that all fourteen isolates reported in this study were genetically related to the variant GI-23 lineage with 92\u2013100% identity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ACoVs are circulating in Egyptian wild birds and highlight their possible contributions in the disease dynamics. The study also proposes that regular monitoring of the ACoVs in wild birds is required to effectively assess the role of wild birds in disease spread, and the emergence of ACoVs strains in the country.","publish_time":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"A.

However, it has mostly taken the form of ad hoc surveys, or has focused on adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals. In 2006 a Blue Ribbon Panel was convened by the U.S. White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to discuss the potential utility of a national companion animal health surveillance system. Such a system could provide fundamental information about disease occurrence, transmission and risk factors; and could facilitate industry-supported pharmaco-epidemiological studies and post-market surveillance. Disease WatchDog, a prospective national disease surveillance project, was officially launched in January 2010 to capture data on diseases in dogs and cats throughout Australia. Participation is encouraged by providing registrants real-time disease maps and material for improved communication between veterinarians and clients. From January to mid-November 2010, an estimated 31% of veterinary clinics Australia-wide joined the project. Over 1300 disease cases \u2013 including Canine Parvovirus (CPV), Canine Distemper, Canine Hepatitis, Feline Calicivirus, Feline Herpesvirus, and Tick Paralysis \u2013 were reported. In New South Wales alone, 552 CPV cases in dogs were reported from 89 postcode locations. New South Wales data was scanned using the space\u2013time permutation test. Up to 24 clusters (P \u003C 0.01) were identified, occurring in all months except March. The greatest number of clusters (n = 6) were identified in April. The most likely cluster was identified in western Sydney, where 36 cases of CPV were reported from a postcode in February. Although the project is still in its infancy, already new information on disease distribution has been produced. Disease information generated could facilitate targeted control and prevention programs.","publish_time":"2011-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ward, M.P.; Kelman, M.","journal":"Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f97f837ba0b4763aa547e1069720b2fcb0cd1356.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102770.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22748174/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2011.07.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877584511000323; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877584511000323","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Blue Ribbon Panel","U.S. White House Office of Science and Technology Policy","Canine Parvovirus","CPV"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["Disease information","disease cases","disease occurrence","Disease WatchDog","disease distribution","Infectious disease surveillance","prospective national disease surveillance project","CPV cases","cases of CPV","new information","registrants real-time disease maps","New South Wales data","Canine Hepatitis","Canine Distemper","Canine Parvovirus","national companion animal health surveillance system","post-market surveillance","fundamental information","dogs","Feline Calicivirus","Feline Herpesvirus","companion animals","postcode locations","greatest number of clusters","veterinary clinics Australia-wide","material","Technology Policy","potential utility","improved communication","transmission","pharmaco-epidemiological studies","White House Office of Science","industry","space","risk factors","targeted control","western Sydney","veterinarians","diseases","cats","infancy","Tick Paralysis","long history","time permutation test","likely cluster","prevention programs","clients","adverse reactions","Blue Ribbon Panel","surveys","pharmaceuticals","Participation","form of","months"],"language":"en"},

We review China\u2019s key national-level HIV/AIDS policies and discuss policy gaps and challenges ahead. Methods We conducted a desk review of key national-level policies that have had a major impact on China\u2019s HIV/AIDS epidemic, and examined recent epidemiological data relevant to China\u2019s HIV response. Results National-level policies that have had a major impact on China\u2019s HIV/AIDS response include: \u2018Four Frees and One Care\u2019; 5-year action plans; and HIV/AIDS regulation. These landmark policies have facilitated massive scaling up of services over the past decade. For example, the number of drug users provided with methadone maintenance treatment significantly increased from 8116 in 2005 to 241 975 in 2009; almost a 30-fold increase. The \u2018Four Frees and One Care\u2019 policy has increased the number of people living with AIDS on anti-retroviral treatment from some 100 patients in 2003 to over 80 000 in 2009. However, stigma and discrimination remains major obstacles for people living with HIV/AIDS trying to access services. Conclusions China\u2019s current national policies are increasingly information driven and responsive to changes in the epidemic.

The specificity of this technique was confirmed by its ability to detect all 17 different strains of MHV and 6 strains of rat coronaviruses as well as its failure to detect human, bovine, and porcine coronaviruses nonspecifically. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP was 3.2-fold higher than that of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 31.6-fold lower than that of nested RT-PCR. An evaluation of the diagnostic performance of RT-LAMP performed in duplicate using mouse fecal specimens showed that the sensitivity and specificity with respect to nested RT-PCR were 85.7% and 100%, respectively.

Pathogen exposure induces changes in host proteins at many functional levels including cell signaling pathways, protein degradation, cytokines and growth factor production, phagocytosis, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Since proteins are responsible for the cell biological functions, pathogens have evolved to manipulate the host cell proteome to achieve optimal replication. Intracellular pathogens can also change their proteome to adapt to the host cell and escape from immune surveillance, or can incorporate cellular proteins to invade other cells. Given that the interactions of intracellular infectious agents with host cells are mainly at the protein level, proteomics is the most suitable tool for investigating these interactions. Proteomics is the systematic analysis of proteins, particularly their interactions, modifications, localization and functions, that permits the study of the association between pathogens with their host cells as well as complex interactions such as the host\u2013vector\u2013pathogen interplay.

Currently, various initiatives collect sales data of veterinary antimicrobials, thereby providing an overview of quantities on the market. However, sales data collected at the level of wholesalers or marketing authorization holders are of limited use to associate with the prevalence of bacterial resistances at species level. We converted sales data to the number of potential treatments of calves and pigs in Switzerland for the years 2011 to 2015 using animal course doses (ACD). For each authorized product, the number of potential therapies was derived from the sales at wholesaler\u0027s level and the ACD in mg per kg. For products registered for use in multiple species, a percentage of the sales was attributed to each authorized species according to their biomass distribution. We estimated a total of 5,914,349 therapies for pigs and 1,407,450 for calves in 2015. Using the number of slaughtered animals for that year as denominator, we calculated a treatment intensity of 2.15 therapies per pig and 5.96 per calf. Between 2011 and 2015, sales of veterinary antimicrobials decreased by 30%. The calculated number of potential therapies decreased by 30% for pigs and 15% for calves. An analysis of treatment intensity at antimicrobial class level showed a decrease of 64% for colistin used in pigs, and of 7% for macrolides used in both pigs and calves. Whereas the use of 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins in calves decreased by 15.8%, usage of fluoroquinolones increased by 10.8% in the same period. Corresponding values for pigs were \u221216.4 and \u002B0.7%. This is the first extrapolation of antimicrobial usage at product level for pigs and calves in Switzerland. It shows that calves were more frequently treated than pigs with a decreasing trend for both number of therapies and use of colistin, macrolides and cephalosporins 3rd and 4th generations. Nonetheless, we calculated an increase in the usage of fluoroquinolones. Altogether, this study\u0027s outcomes allow for trend analysis and can be used to assess the relationship between antimicrobial use and resistance at the national level.","publish_time":"2019-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stebler, Rosa; Carmo, Lu\u00EDs P.; Heim, Dagmar; Naegeli, Hanspeter; Eichler, Klaus; Muentener, Cedric R.","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38a24f1500fcb5cfbac618720eb8996fd27029a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6763737.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2019.00318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616676/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["pigs","number of therapies","species level","product level","contribution of antimicrobial use","limited use","number of potential treatments of calves","calculated number of potential therapies","antimicrobial class level","sales of veterinary antimicrobials","level of wholesalers","national level","wholesaler\u0027s level","sales data of veterinary antimicrobials","extrapolation of antimicrobial usage","authorized species","usage of fluoroquinolones","number of slaughtered animals","veterinary medicine","multiple species","analysis of treatment intensity","authorized product","trend analysis","Switzerland","ACD","colistin","macrolides","decreasing trend","generation cephalosporins","marketing authorization holders","human","emergence","denominator","prevalence of bacterial resistances","various initiatives","years","decrease","percentage","animal course doses","resistant bacteria","overview of quantities","study\u0027s outcomes","biomass distribution","products","relationship","generations","calf","increase","substances","Corresponding values","total","setting","period"],"language":"en"},

Aims This review article documents and critically assesses, for the first time; up to date categorized information about C. serrata including its reported pharmacological activities, cultural uses, active compounds, and botanical description. Materials and method s: All provided information about C. serrata was collected using the electronic databases (e.g. Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Springer Link), books (e.g. Trees of Pakistan and Herbalism, Phytochemistry, and Ethnopharmacology) and thesis. Results Qualitative and quantitative phytochemical studies on C. serrata revealed the presence of important chemical constituents such as; flavonoids, phenolic acids, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, and cardiac glycosides. The phytochemicals showed various in vitro activities like antioxidant, anti-infective, antiglycation, cytotoxic activities. Major areas of research conducted on C. serrata are its antioxidant and anti-infective activities. Few historical uses of C. serrata are supported by modern in vitro pharmacological studies such as; antidiarrheal, antidiabetic, and leishmanicidal activity. Conclusion There were convincing evidence in in vitro studies supporting C. serrata antioxidant, anti-infective, anti-diabetic, anti-glycating, and cytotoxic activities. Nevertheless, all reported pharmacological activities were carried out in vitro and a gap in research i.e. preclinical and clinical investigation still exists. The authors emphasize the need for future in-depth research and clinical trials to investigate C. serrata pharmacological activity, clinical efficacy and safety. The potential chemical compounds with suggestive classes may need to be isolated and pharmacological activities must be established for these compounds. The plant has very limited information about pharmacological activities and the data available for supportive cultural uses needs proper validation.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almubayedh, Hanine; Ahmad, Rizwan","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/258f2880d2fdcb0a006c1c21243838370ed9b334.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126226.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31494199/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874119301436; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.112206; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874119301436","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serrata antioxidant","serrata pharmacological activity","anti-infective activities","reported pharmacological activities","cytotoxic activities","pharmacological studies","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance Cedrela serrata Royle","clinical trials","supportive cultural uses","clinical efficacy","liver diseases","treatment of various diseases","clinical investigation","blood diseases","active compounds","historical uses of","potential chemical compounds","limited information","need","future in-depth research","quantitative phytochemical studies","Major areas of research","anti-diabetic","Science Direct","Web of Science","anti-glycating","presence of important chemical constituents","leishmanicidal activity","medicinal plant","important conventional medicine","intestinal worms","chronic infantile dysentery","hypertension","diarrhea","fever","PubMed","data available","saponins","flavonoids","Scopus","Google Scholar","Springer Link","Phytochemistry","tannins","books","alkaloids","phenolic acids","skin","constructions","suggestive classes","jaundice","diabetes","antiglycation","Trees of Pakistan","electronic databases","proper validation","Herbalism","antidiabetic","safety","botanical description","convincing evidence","Ethnopharmacology","cardiac glycosides","authors","method s","gap","date","phytochemicals","review article documents","Materials","thesis"],"language":"en"},

They are also associated with extra-intestinal diseases, such as hepatitis in ducklings, nephritis in chickens, and encephalitis in cattle. In February 2017, a fatal infection of goslings characterized by visceral urate deposition was reported in the Shandong province, China. Our systematic investigation led to the isolation of an astrovirus, designated AAstV/Goose/CHN/2017/SD01, and similar disease was reproduced by experimental infection of healthy goslings, fulfilling Koch\u2019s postulates. The isolated astrovirus replicated well and resulted in 100% mortality of goose embryos. Complete genome sequence analysis revealed that the isolate was genetically distinct from known astroviruses and closely related to members of the avastrovirus genogroup II. Experimental infection showed that the isolate was highly pathogenic in goslings, causing clinical signs, growth repression and in many cases mortality. Histopathological examination indicated that lesions occurred mainly in the kidneys of infected birds. However, virus-specific genomic RNA was detected in all representative tissues, and virus shedding was detected up to 12 days after inoculation, suggesting that the isolate was able to spread systemically and replicate efficiently in vivo. Collectively, our study demonstrates, for the first time, the etiological role of a genetically distinct astrovirus in the fatal infection of goslings.","publish_time":"2018-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qingshui; Cao, Yanxin; Wang, Jun; Fu, Guanghua; Sun, Mengxu; Zhang, Lijiao; Meng, Li; Cui, Guolin; Huang, Yu; Hu, Xueying; Su, Jingliang","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f715f94955504e6dbe3963ec0ccebb0a431e7c4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5908792.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29674726/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41426-018-0074-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["fatal infection of goslings","experimental infection of healthy goslings","distinct astrovirus","isolated astrovirus","mortality of goose embryos","virus shedding","known astroviruses","cases mortality","virus-specific genomic RNA","hepatitis","growth repression","chickens","isolation","clinical signs","designated AAstV","visceral urate deposition","representative tissues","leading cause of gastroenteritis","humans","nephritis","ducklings","members","SD01","CHN","etiological role","similar disease","Complete genome sequence analysis","Shandong province","Koch\u2019s postulates","extra-intestinal diseases","lesions","time","encephalitis","animals","kidneys of infected birds","Histopathological examination","avastrovirus genogroup","days","China","systematic investigation","cattle","inoculation","study"],"language":"en"},

In swine so far only little information about this lymphocyte population exists. Phenotypical analyses with newly developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against porcine NKp46 recently revealed that in blood NKp46(-) and NKp46(\u002B) cells with NK phenotype exist with comparable cytotoxic properties. In spleen a third NKp46-defined population with NK phenotype was observed that was characterised by a low to negative CD8\u03B1 and increased NKp46 expression. In the current study it is shown that this NKp46(high) phenotype was correlated with an increased expression of CD16 and CD27 compared to the CD8\u03B1(\u002B)NKp46(-) and NKp46(\u002B) NK-cell subsets in spleen and blood. Additionally NKp46(high) NK cells expressed elevated levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on mRNA level. Functional analyses revealed that splenic NKp46(high) NK cells produced much higher levels of Interferon-\u03B3 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03B1 upon stimulation with cytokines or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate/Ionomycin compared to the other two subsets. Furthermore, cross-linking of NKp46 by NKp46-specific mAbs led to a superior CD107a expression in the NKp46(high) NK cells, thus indicating a higher cytolytic capacity of this subset. Therefore porcine splenic NKp46(high) NK cells represent a highly activated subset of NK cells and may play a profound role in the immune surveillance of this organ.","publish_time":"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mair, Kerstin H; M\u00FCllebner, Andrea; Essler, Sabine E; Duvigneau, J Catharina; Storset, Anne K; Saalm\u00FCller, Armin; Gerner, Wilhelm","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/402334dfcf4430553c3f99a5bbe869a3882c1d97.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3599810.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23452562/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-44-13","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","Tumor Necrosis"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine NKp46","blood NKp46","increased NKp46 expression","NK phenotype","porcine splenic NKp46","NKp46-specific mAbs","NKp46-defined population","activated subset of NK cells","NK-cell subsets","increased expression of CD16","spleen","higher levels of Interferon","superior CD107a expression","elevated levels","crucial role","profound role","immune surveillance","negative CD8\u03B1","Phenotypical analyses","lymphocyte population","Functional analyses","higher cytolytic capacity","early phase of immune responses","Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03B1","chemokine receptor CXCR3","stimulation","developed monoclonal antibodies","cytokines","various pathogens","comparable cytotoxic properties","myristate","phorbol","mRNA level","little information","CD27","Ionomycin","Natural Killer","acetate","swine","organ","current study"],"language":"en"},

Public confidence in vaccination programs depends on the work they do for the community\u2014social, political, and moral as well as biological. The concept of public health and its programs must be broader than the delivery of the vaccine technology itself.

Our objective was to detect pathogens found in children with ARI in rural Haiti to help develop evidence-based guidelines for treatment and prevention. METHODS: Retrospective study of students with ARI at four schools in rural Haiti. Viral and/or bacterial pathogens were identified by qPCR in 177 nasal swabs collected from April 2013 through November 2015. RESULTS: Most common viruses detected were Rhinovirus (36%), Influenza A (16%) and Adenovirus (7%), and bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (58%) and Staphylococcus aureus (28%). Compared to older children, children aged 3\u20135 years had more Influenza A (28% vs. 9%, p = 0.002) and Adenovirus detected (14% vs. 3%, p = 0.01). Similarly, S. pneumoniae was greatest in children 3\u20135 years old (71% 3\u20135yrs; 58% 6\u201315 years; 25% 16\u201320 years; p = 0.008).

This study investigated the trends in antimicrobial resistance in S. marcescens from a nationwide surveillance in Taiwan. Materials and methods S. marcescens isolates were collected biennially between 2002 and 2010 from medical centers and regional hospitals throughout Taiwan, as part of the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution method. Results A total of 403 nonduplicate S. marcescens isolates were collected, mostly from respiratory samples (157, 39.0%), followed by the urinary tract samples (90, 22.3%). Overall, 99.3% isolates were susceptible to imipenem, 93.8% to ceftazidime, 89.2% to minocycline, 87.8% to amikacin, 86.8% to cefepime, 82.9% to aztreonam, 73.2% to ceftriaxone, 72.7% to levofloxacin, 63.8% to ciprofloxacin, 60.8% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), and 59.6% to gentamicin. A significantly increased susceptibility rate after 2004 was observed for the following antibiotics: amikacin (73.8% vs. 97.1%), gentamicin (40.0% vs. 72.4%), ciprofloxacin (53.8% vs. 70.4%), ceftriaxone (53.8% vs. 86.0%), cefepime (74.4% vs. 95.1%), aztreonam (72.5% vs. 89.7%), and TMP/SMX (41.3% vs. 73.7%). Conclusion In this 8-year study, the susceptibility of S. marcescens to ceftazidime and imipenem remained consistently high in Taiwan. S. marcescens isolates demonstrated relatively higher resistance to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, and therefore continued surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, especially for fluoroquinolone, is warranted.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liou, Bo-Huang; Duh, Ruay-Wang; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Yang Lauderdale, Tsai-Ling; Fung, Chang-Phone","journal":"Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b27ff5023e0a1af4b8d3fe0081381f87fbef660f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105062.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118213000728; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2013.04.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118213000728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23751769/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. marcescens"],"organizations":["TMP/SMX"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["isolates","Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program","higher resistance","continued surveillance of antimicrobial resistance","ciprofloxacin","characteristic property of resistance","levofloxacin","nationwide surveillance","imipenem","ceftazidime","amikacin","TMP","SMX","aztreonam","cefepime","ceftriaxone","gentamicin","year study","respiratory samples","increased susceptibility rate","urinary tract samples","Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution method","important nosocomial pathogen","novel AmpC cephalosporinase","spectrum beta-lactamase","medical centers","regional hospitals","trimethoprim","Background Serratia","sulfamethoxazole","trends","Minimal inhibitory concentrations","following antibiotics","Conclusion","Materials","methods","total","nonduplicate","minocycline","fluoroquinolone"],"language":"en"},

They are organized as operons in which, usually, the antitoxin gene precedes the cognate toxin gene. The antitoxin generally acts as a transcriptional self-repressor, whereas the toxin acts as a co-repressor, both proteins constituting a harmless complex. When bacteria encounter a stressful environment, TAs are triggered. The antitoxin protein is unstable and will be degraded by host proteases, releasing the free toxin to halt essential processes. The result is a cessation of cell growth or even death. Because of their ubiquity and the essential processes targeted, TAs have been proposed as good candidates for development of novel antimicrobials. We discuss here the possible druggability of TAs as antivirals and antibacterials, with focus on the potentials and the challenges that their use may find in the \u2018real\u2019 world. We present strategies to develop TAs as antibacterials in view of novel technologies, such as the use of very small molecules (fragments) as inhibitors of protein\u2013protein interactions.

The clinical symptoms of Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers are difficult to distinguish and there are currently no specific antiviral therapies against either of the viruses. Therefore, a drug that is safe and effective against both would be an enormous breakthrough. We and others have shown that the folding of the glycoproteins of many enveloped viruses, including the filoviruses, is far more dependent upon the calnexin pathway of protein folding than are most host glycoproteins. Drugs that inhibit this pathway would be expected to be selectively antiviral. Indeed, as we summarize in this review, imino sugars that are competitive inhibitors of the host endoplasmic reticular \u03B1-glucosidases I and II, which are enzymes that process N-glycan on nascent glycoproteins and thereby inhibit calnexin binding to the nascent glycoproteins, have been shown to have antiviral activity against a number of enveloped viruses including filoviruses. In this review, we describe the state of development of imino sugars for use against the filoviruses, and provide an explanation for the basis of their antiviral activity as well as limitations.","publish_time":"2013-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Jinhong; Guo, Ju-Tao; Du, Yanming; Block, Timothy","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d74ca96879ef6d9982cb7ddaf5396940697dc8dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3924557.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2013.77; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038444/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["host glycoproteins","nascent glycoproteins","filoviruses","antiviral activity","Marburg virus","Ebola virus","imino sugars","number of enveloped viruses","specific antiviral therapies","review","folding","Marburg hemorrhagic fevers","calnexin pathway of protein","calnexin binding","clinical symptoms of Ebola","deadly hemorrhagic fever disease","host endoplasmic reticular \u03B1-glucosidases","competitive inhibitors","etiological agents","members","family of Filoviridae","state of development","N-glycan","basis","explanation","enzymes","limitations","enormous breakthrough","Drugs"],"language":"en"},

Along with the rapid rise of novel forms of intensive aquaculture, increased global aquatic animal movement and various anthropogenic stress to aquatic ecosystems during the past century, freshwater fish farming industry encounter the emergence and breakout of many diseases, especially viral diseases. Because of the ability to safely and effectively prevent aquaculture diseases, vaccines have become the mainstream technology for prevention and control of aquatic diseases in the world. In this review, authors summarized six major cyprinid viral diseases, including koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD), spring viraemia of carp (SVC), grass carp hemorrhagic disease (GCHD), koi sleepy disease (KSD), carp pox disease (CPD) and herpesviral haematopoietic necrosis (HPHN). The present review described the characteristics of these diseases from epidemiology, pathology, etiology and diagnostics. Furthermore, the development of specific vaccines respective to these diseases is stated according to preparation methods and immunization approaches. It is hoped that the review could contribute to aquaculture in prevention and controlling of cyprinid viral diseases, and serve the healthy and sustainable development of aquaculture industry.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Hang; Su, Jianguo","journal":"Fish \u0026 Shellfish Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59d3277a36eac8a08d5457583df553ccb46110c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118463.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.09.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1050464818305394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30195914/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464818305394","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aquaculture diseases","control of aquatic diseases","major cyprinid viral diseases","carp pox disease","koi herpesvirus disease","koi sleepy disease","grass carp hemorrhagic disease","sustainable development of aquaculture industry","aquatic ecosystems","prevention","present review","global aquatic animal movement","global freshwater fish production","freshwater fish farming industry","spring viraemia of carp","past century","past decades","rapid rise of novel forms of intensive aquaculture","development of specific vaccines respective","various anthropogenic stress","SVC","GCHD","CPD","KHVD","emergence","KSD","herpesviral haematopoietic necrosis","epidemiology","mainstream technology","breakout","authors","preparation methods","pathology","etiology","characteristics","immunization approaches","diagnostics","HPHN","Abstract","world","largest portion","ability"],"language":"en"},

We examined patterns of telemedicine use for outpatient pediatric subspecialty care within state Medicaid programs. METHODS: We identified children \u226417 years old in 2014 Medicaid Analysis eXtract data for 12 states. We identified telemedicine-using and telemedicine non-using medical and surgical subspecialists. Among children cared for by telemedicine-using subspecialists, we assessed child and subspecialist characteristics associated with any telemedicine visit using logistic regression with subspecialist-level random effects. Among children cared for by telemedicine-using and non-using subspecialists, we compared visit rates across child characteristics by assessing negative binomial regression interaction terms. RESULTS: Of 12,237,770 pediatric Medicaid beneficiaries, 2,051,690 (16.8%) had \u22651 subspecialist visit. Of 42,695 subspecialists identified, 146 (0.3%) had \u22651 telemedicine claim. Among children receiving care from telemedicine-using subspecialists, likelihood of any telemedicine use was increased for rural children (OR 10.4, 95%CI 6.3-17.1 compared to large metropolitan referent group) and those \u003E90 miles from the subspecialist (OR 13.4, 95% CI 10.2-17.7 compared to 0-30 mile referent group). Compared to children receiving care from telemedicine non-using subspecialists, matched children receiving care from telemedicine-using subspecialists had larger differences in visit rates by distance to care, county rurality, ZIP code median income, and child race/ethnicity (p\u003C0.001 for interaction terms). CONCLUSION: Children in rural communities and at distance to subspecialists had increased likelihood of telemedicine use. Use overall was low, and results indicated that early telemedicine policies and implementation did not close disparities in subspecialty visit rates by child geographic and sociodemographic characteristics.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ray, Kristin N; Mehrotra, Ateev; Yabes, Jonathan; Kahn, Jeremy M","journal":"Acad Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1db68d4b870afb643cfc25ac7ca70c0b9bd684ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194998.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278078/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2020.03.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285920301649?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876285920301649","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Medicaid"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["telemedicine visit","telemedicine non-using subspecialists","telemedicine claim","patterns of telemedicine use","increased likelihood of telemedicine use","early telemedicine policies","Live-interactive telemedicine","rural children","surgical subspecialists","subspecialist visit","matched children","visit rates","child characteristics","subspecialist characteristics","utilization of subspecialty care","outpatient pediatric subspecialty care","state Medicaid programs","child race","child geographic","pediatric Medicaid beneficiaries","distance","sociodemographic characteristics","RESULTS","Medicaid Analysis eXtract data","subspecialist-level random effects","mile referent group","negative binomial regression interaction terms","logistic regression","rural communities","large metropolitan referent group","ZIP code median income","county rurality","implementation","close disparities","larger differences","years old","ethnicity","states","equity","OBJECTIVE","CONCLUSION","miles","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey using random Global Positioning System (GPS) spatial sampling conducted from the 8 August 2015 to 6 September 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or more. METHOD: A 19-item questionnaire was developed to assess respondents\u2019 preparedness information acquisition, communication plan, evacuation strategies, first-aid and disaster knowledge, financial resilience, and preparedness behaviors. In total, 1023 residents were interviewed at 516 GPS locations. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with preparedness behaviors, defined as having an evacuation kit in our study. RESULTS: Television remains the key information source, both before and during disaster, with young respondents also favoring social media and the internet and elder residents preferring television and radio. Many respondents did not have adequate first-aid knowledge and few showed correct responses to a typhoon warning signal. Only 39.4% had an evacuation kit. In logistic regression, correct responses to first aid questions and a typhoon warning signal were significantly associated with kit preparation (OR 2.023, 95% CI 1.233\u22123.318, p=0.005).

They were caused by a previously unknown coronavirus. All patients had been associated with the Wuhan Wholefood market, where seafood and live animals are sold. The virus spread rapidly and public health authorities in China initiated a containment effort. However, by that time, travelers had carried the virus to many countries, sparking memories of the previous coronavirus epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and causing widespread media attention and panic. Based on clinical criteria and available serological and molecular information, the new disease was called coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the novel coronavirus was called SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emphasizing its close relationship to the 2002 SARS virus (SARS-CoV). The scientific community raced to uncover the origin of the virus, understand the pathogenesis of the disease, develop treatment options, define the risk factors, and work on vaccine development. Here we present a summary of current knowledge regarding the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rabi, Firas A.; Al Zoubi, Mazhar S.; Kasasbeh, Ghena A.; Salameh, Dunia M.; Al-Nasser, Amjad D.","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65b9002fddcf6c32adaf8d89bb4d84042ce79422.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157541.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32245083/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9030231","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["SARS Coronavirus","coronavirus disease","SARS virus","novel coronavirus","SARS-CoV","unknown coronavirus","previous coronavirus epidemics","new disease","China","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Middle East respiratory syndrome","Wuhan Wholefood market","molecular information","MERS","risk factors","seafood","public health authorities","memories","clinical criteria","treatment options","cluster of fatal pneumonia cases","work","widespread media attention","summary of current knowledge","vaccine development","live animals","containment effort","panic","origin","countries","pathogenesis","close relationship","scientific community","time","travelers","COVID","patients"],"language":"en"},

A number of clinical trials have been conducted and published. However, there is no systematic review or meta-analysis on their efficacy and safety for the common cold to justify their clinical use. METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SinoMed, CNKI, VIP, China Important Conference Papers Database, China Dissertation Database, and online clinical trial registry websites for published and unpublished randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of CPMs for the common cold till 31 March 2013. Revman 5.2 software was used for data analysis with effect estimate presented as relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of five RCTs were identified. All of the RCTs were of high risk of bias with flawed study design and poor methodological quality. All RCTs included children aged between 6 months to 14 years. Results of individual trials showed that Shuanghuanglian oral liquid (RR 4.00; 95% CI: 2.26 to 7.08), and Xiaoer Resuqing oral liquid (RR 1.43; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.77) had higher cure rates compared with antivirus drugs. Most of the trials did not report adverse events, and the safety of CPMs was still uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Some CPMs showed a potential positive effect for the common cold on cure rate. However, due to the poor methodology quality and the defects in the clinical design of the included RCTs, such as the lack of placebo controlled trials, the inappropriate comparison intervention and outcome measurement, the confirmative conclusions on the beneficial effect of CPMs for the common cold could not be drawn.","publish_time":"2014-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wei; Liu, Bo; Wang, Li-qiong; Ren, Jun; Liu, Jian-ping","journal":"BMC Complement Altern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f6da38ab5fa77f94deb29bfa51504be4ebd018b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4129119.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25074623/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Revman"],"organizations":["State of Food and Drug Administration","Xiaoer Resuqing"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["number of clinical trials","clinical design","safety of CPMs","included RCTs","RR","beneficial effect of CPMs","unpublished randomized clinical trials","clinical use","Results of individual trials","effect estimate","clinical trial registry websites","lack of placebo controlled trials","China Dissertation Database","potential positive effect","Shuanghuanglian oral liquid","poor methodological quality","poor methodology quality","relative risk","meta-analysis","data analysis","confirmative conclusions","Xiaoer Resuqing oral liquid","China Important Conference Papers Database","flawed study design","high risk of bias","Chinese State of Food","higher cure rates","Chinese patent medicines","VIP","CNKI","inappropriate comparison intervention","SinoMed","outcome measurement","efficacy","Drug Administration","MEDLINE","EMBASE","treatment","defects","mean difference","antivirus drugs","MD","systematic review","adverse events","software","BACKGROUND","months","confidence interval","Revman","METHODS","children","total","years"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a quartz crystal microbalance-based immunosensor (QCM) has been developed and its potential evaluated for the rapid and sensitive detection of both influenza A and B viruses in laboratory-cultured preparations and clinical samples. The effective limit for detection by QCM for stock preparations of both A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40 viruses was 1\u00D7104 pfu/mL, associated with observed frequency shifts of 30 (\u00B15) and 37 (\u00B16.5)Hz, respectively. Conjugation of 13nm gold nanoparticles to the detecting antibody improved the mass sensitivity of the immunosensor, resulting in a 10-fold increase in sensitivity and a detection limit of 1\u00D7103 pfu/mL for both preparations, with resulting frequency shifts of 102 (\u00B111) and 115 (\u00B15)Hz, respectively. Detection of virus in nasal washes with this technique was achieved by overnight passage in MDCK cultures prior to analysis. A comparison of results obtained from 67 clinical samples using existing RT-PCR, shell vial, cell culture and ELISA methods showed that QCM techniques were comparable in sensitivity and specificity to cell culture methods.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peduru Hewa, Thamara M.; Tannock, Gregory A.; Mainwaring, David E.; Harrison, Sally; Fecondo, John V.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63c8de490d2b494cff5edf10398374305e6b48bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112868.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19628008/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093409003140; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093409003140; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.07.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lee"],"organizations":["QCM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell culture methods","sensitive detection","Detection of virus","detection limit","ELISA methods","laboratory-cultured preparations","QCM techniques","mass sensitivity","clinical samples","stock preparations","B viruses","case of viral culture","pfu","resulting frequency shifts","Hz","Abstract Current methods","observed frequency shifts","effective limit","quartz crystal microbalance-based immunosensor","specialised laboratory facilities","existing RT-PCR","accurate diagnosis of influenza","shell vial","detecting antibody","specificity","overnight passage","nm gold nanoparticles","trained personnel","MDCK cultures","analysis","nasal washes","fold increase","Conjugation","study","Lee","comparison of results","days","definitive result","potential"],"language":"en"},

Methods Probable SARS cases occurring between November 2002 and May 2003 in mainland China were compiled from different sources and geo\u2010coded into a geographical information database based on onset location. Spatial analyses including kernel density estimation, and spatial statistical and tracking analyses were performed to characterise the spatiotemporal distribution of SARS cases based on onset location/date. SARS cases that got infected in Beijing but were reported in three provinces surrounding Beijing were mapped, and logistic regression using a \u2018case\u2013control\u2019 design at the county level was performed to analyse the impact of travel\u2010related risk factors in the diffusion pattern. Results The SARS epidemic in mainland China spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas in Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region, Hebei Province and Tianjin. Counties in the neighbourhood of Beijing that were crossed by a national highway or inter\u2010provincial freeway showed the highest risk of acquiring SARS infections, even after correction for population density and medical staff density. Being intersected by a railway did not significantly associate with risk of SARS. Conclusions This study provides the first complete documentation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the SARS epidemic in mainland China. Our analyses confirmed that SARS had benefited from national highways and inter\u2010provincial freeways for its spread from epicentres to neighbouring areas, whereas trains showed no significant association. This knowledge may be important for the control of re\u2010emerging SARS, or other future emerging human\u2010to\u2010human transmittable infections.","publish_time":"2009-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Li\u2010Qun; De Vlas, Sake J.; Feng, Dan; Liang, Song; Xu, You\u2010Fu; Zhou, Jie\u2010Ping; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Cao, Wu\u2010Chun","journal":"Trop Med Int Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0acbde5c3e5d4f964215218392e5fe30231920e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169839.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02189.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19508436/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region, Hebei Province"],"locations":["China","Beijing","Tianjin"],"keyphrases":["risk of SARS","SARS epidemic","control of re\u2010emerging SARS","spatial pattern of SARS transmission","spatiotemporal distribution of SARS cases","mainland China","Methods Probable SARS cases","highest risk of acquiring SARS infections","Spatial analyses","neighbouring areas","surrounding areas","Beijing epicentre","neighbourhood of Beijing","Shanxi Province","Hebei Province","population density","Guangdong Province","spatiotemporal diffusion","diffusion pattern","onset location","tracking analyses","inter\u2010provincial freeways","kernel density estimation","related risk factors","medical staff density","human transmittable infections","national highways","geographical information database","large geographical extent","future emerging human","Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region","correction","severe acute respiratory syndrome","epicentres","spread","temporal characteristics","different sources","complete documentation","trains","impact of travel","design","Tianjin","months","county level","logistic regression","study","date","significant association","Conclusions","knowledge","Objectives","Counties","provinces","railway"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of persistent bacterial bronchitis. Blind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with persistent bacterial bronchitis, with an additional directed sample obtained from persistent bacterial bronchitis patients. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assay prior to microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. This has important implications for collecting lower respiratory samples from healthy children. A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P \u003C 0.001) and change in community composition (R2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed between controls and patients. Bacterial communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with the patient group. In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not identified by standard routine clinical culture. The bacteria present in the lungs of patients with persistent bacterial bronchitis were less diverse in terms of richness and evenness. The results validate the clinical diagnosis, and suggest that more attention to bacterial communities in children with chronic cough may lead to more rapid recognition of this condition with earlier treatment and reduction in disease burden.","publish_time":"2017-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cuthbertson, Leah; Craven, Vanessa; Bingle, Lynne; Cookson, William O.C.M.; Everard, Mark L.; Moffatt, Miriam F.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65d4b04f3c2469c918b9df05d79d6d78e8276a37.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7116ddab89281e7641fb659019c90ee3715f5039.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/181982","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial diversity","persistent bacterial bronchitis patients","Bacterial communities","development of persistent bacterial bronchitis","respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children","young children","blind brushings","community composition","lungs of patients","healthy controls","microbial community analysis","chronic cough","S rRNA gene sequencing","non-blind brushes","R2","S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assay","significant difference","protected brushings","significant decrease","airway microbiota","clinical diagnosis","leading cause of chronic wet cough","indicator species analysis","lower respiratory samples","standard routine clinical culture","earlier treatment","additional directed sample","reduction","condition","rapid recognition","Proteobacteria","valid means","disease burden","Neisseria","Haemophilus","important implications","terms of richness","PBB","attention","evenness","cases","dominant organism","bacteria present","changes","impact","results","study","patient group","DNA"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we further maintained the 83P-5 in Vero cells up to the 100th passage and analyzed changes in the spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) gene sequences and pathogenicity of the virus at the 34th, 61st, and 100th passage levels. Sequence analyses revealed a strong selection for the S gene of 83P-5 in Vero cells, and virtually all mutations occurring at the 34th and 61st passages had been carried over to the 100th-passaged virus. In contrast, the viral M and N genes showed a strong conservation during the serial passage.

Interestingly, S protein of the attenuated 100th-passaged 83P-5 showed a remarkable sequence similarity to that of previously reported DR-13 strain of attenuated PEDV that also had been established by serial passage in Vero cells. Further studies will be required to define whether the mutations in the S gene of 83P-5 that had been selected and accumulated during the serial passages are indeed the causalities of the growth adaptation in vitro and the attenuation of virulence in vivo.","publish_time":"2011-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sato, Tetsuo; Takeyama, Natsumi; Katsumata, Atsushi; Tuchiya, Kotaro; Kodama, Toshiaki; Kusanagi, Ko-ichi","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088782.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21559974/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-011-0617-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Vero"],"keyphrases":["passaged virus","Vero cells","passage levels","S gene","cultured cells","serial passages","S protein","strain of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","growth adaptation","strain of attenuated PEDV","gene sequences","mutations","strong selection","strong conservation","N genes","Sequence analyses","reported DR","attenuation of virulence","remarkable sequence similarity","nucleocapsid","spike","causalities","pathogenicity","membrane","changes","contrast","study","Pigs","studies"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of American adults (n=1010), aged 18-94, running from April 10-20, 2020. We assessed depressive symptoms (CES-D-10 scale), loneliness (UCLA 3-Item Loneliness scale), and frequency of in-person and remote social connections (4 items, e.g. hugging family member, video chats) and sexual connections (4 items, e.g. partnered sexual activity, dating app use). Results: One-third of participants (32%) reported depressive symptoms, and loneliness was high [mean (SD): 4.4 (1.7)]. Those with depressive symptoms were more likely to be women, age 20-29, unmarried, and low-income. Frequent in-person connections were associated with lower depression and loneliness; frequent remote connections were not. Conclusions: Depression and loneliness were elevated during the early US COVID-19 response. Those who maintained frequent in-person, but not remote, social and sexual connections had better mental health outcomes.

The FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative previously funded a study of HP vapor decontamination of respirators using a Clarus C system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) which normally is used to fumigate hospital rooms. The process preserved respirator function, but it is unknown if HP vapor would be virucidal since respirators have porous fabric that may harbor virus. We evaluated the virucidal activity of HP vapor using a BQ-50 system (Bioquell, Horsham, PA) after inoculating 3M 1870 N95 respirators (3M, St. Paul, MN) with 3 aerosolized bacteriophage that are a reasonable proxy for SARS-CoV-2. Inoculation resulted in contamination of the respirator with 9.87e4 plaque forming units (PFU) of phage phi-6, 4.17e7 PFU of phage T7 and 1.35e7 PFU of phage T1. Respirators were reprocessed with BQ-50 with a long aeration phase to reduce HP vapors. Virucidal activity was measured by a standard plaquing assay prior to and after sterilization. A single HP vapor cycle resulted in complete eradication of phage from masks (limit of detection 10 PFU, lower than the infectious dose of the majority of respiratory viral pathogens). After 5 cycles, the respirators appeared similar to new with no deformity. Use of a Bioquell machine can be scaled to permit simultaneous sterilization of a large number of used but otherwise intact respirators. HP vapor reprocessing may ease shortages and provide a higher filtration crisis alternative to non-NIOSH masks.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kenney, Patrick; Chan, Benjamin K; Kortright, Kaitlyn; Cintron, Margaret; Havill, Nancy; Russi, Mark; Epright, Jaqueline; Lee, Lorraine; Balcezak, Thomas; Martinello, Richard","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff91a3feff872f7fec4322dc1deb020cea41bdc7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20041087","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative","PA","HP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HP vapor reprocessing","study of HP vapor decontamination of respirators","virucidal activity of HP vapor","intact respirators","HP vapors","single HP vapor cycle","Abstract Reprocessing of used N95 respirators","17e7 PFU of phage T7","35e7 PFU of phage T1","phage phi","complete eradication of phage","higher filtration crisis alternative","Horsham","BQ","Bioquell machine","respirator function","simultaneous sterilization","Clarus C system","non-NIOSH masks","supply chain constraints","shortages","infectious dose","limit of detection","reasonable proxy","pandemic","units","long aeration phase","aerosolized bacteriophage","large number","majority of respiratory viral pathogens","COVID","FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative","standard plaquing assay","87e4 plaque","porous fabric","MN","SARS-CoV","Paul","deformity","virus","Inoculation","cycles","hospital rooms"],"language":"en"},

We also estimated the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) and age restrictions on these estimates. Methods: Our secondary analyses estimated hospital worker infections in the US based on health worker infection and death rates per 100 deaths from COVID-19 in Hubei and Italy. We used Monte Carlo simulations to compute point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for hospital worker infections in the US based on the two scenarios. We computed potential decrease in infections if the PPE were available only to those involved in direct care of COVID-19 patients (~ 30%) and if workers aged \u2265 60 years are restricted from patient care. Estimates were adjusted for hospital workers per bed in the US compared to China and Italy. Results: The hospital worker infections per 100 deaths were 108.2 in Hubei and 94.1 in Italy. Based on Hubei scenario, we estimated that about 53,640 US hospital workers (95% CI: 43,160 to 62,251) might get infected from COVID-19. The Italian scenario suggested 53,097 US hospital worker (95% CI: 37,133 to 69,003) might get infected during the pandemic. Availability of PPE to high-risk workers could reduce counts to 28,100 (95% CI: 23,048 to 33,242) considering Hubei and to 28,354 (95% CI: 19,829 to 36,848) considering Italy. Restricting hospital workers aged \u2265 60 years from direct patient care reduced counts to 1,985 (95% CI: 1,627 to 2,347) considering Hubei and to 2,002 (95% CI: 1,400 to 2,602) considering the Italian scenario. Conclusion: We estimated significant burden of illness due to COVID-19 if no strategies are adopted. Making PPE available to all hospital workers and reducing exposure of hospital workers above the age of 60 could have significant reductions in hospital worker infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Razzak, Junaid A; Bhatti, Junaid Ahmad; Tahir, Muhammad Ramzan; Pasha-Razzak, Omrana","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fb51f09a4454a8975a7842a5f1f31fd26749b83.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20055988","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":["United States","China"],"keyphrases":["US hospital workers","hospital worker infections","exposure of hospital workers","CI","high-risk workers","Hubei scenario","Italy","direct care of COVID","PPE available","health worker infection","Availability of PPE","Italian scenario","direct patient care","counts","deaths","years","point estimates","pandemic","age restrictions","significant reductions","significant burden of illness","death rates","confidence intervals","secondary analyses","impact of personal protective equipment","United States","Monte Carlo simulations","bed","Methods","potential decrease","China","patients","Results","Conclusion","strategies","scenarios","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Here we asked whether spontaneous fluctuations in alertness can account for the variability in behavioural and neurophysiological responses to TMS. We combined single-pulse TMS with neural recording via electroencephalography (EEG) to quantify changes in motor and cortical reactivity with fluctuating levels of alertness defined objectively on the basis of ongoing brain activity. We observed rapid, non-linear changes in TMS-evoked neural responses \u2013 specifically, motor evoked potentials and TMS-evoked cortical potentials \u2013 as EEG activity indicated decreasing levels of alertness, even while participants remained awake and responsive in the behavioural task.

Previous analyses estimated the basic epidemiological parameters using symptom onset dates of the confirmed cases in Wuhan and outside China. Methods: We obtained information on the 46 coronavirus cases who traveled from Wuhan before January 23 and have been subsequently confirmed in Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Singapore, and Taiwan as of February 5, 2020. Most cases have detailed travel history and disease progress. Compared to previous analyses, an important distinction is that we used this data to informatively simulate the infection time of each case using the symptom onset time, previously reported incubation interval, and travel history. We then fitted a simple exponential growth model with adjustment for the January 23 travel ban to the distribution of the simulated infection time. We used a Bayesian analysis with diffuse priors to quantify the uncertainty of the estimated epidemiological parameters. We performed sensitivity analysis to different choices of incubation interval and the hyperparameters in the prior specification. Results: We found that our model provides good fit to the distribution of the infection time. Assuming the travel rate to the selected countries and regions is constant over the study period, we found that the epidemic was doubling in size every 2.9 days (95% credible interval [CrI], 2 days--4.1 days). Using previously reported serial interval for 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is 5.7 (95% CrI, 3.4--9.2). The estimates did not change substantially if we assumed the travel rate doubled in the last 3 days before January 23, when we used previously reported incubation interval for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), or when we changed the hyperparameters in our prior specification. Conclusions: Our estimated epidemiological parameters are higher than an earlier report using confirmed cases in Wuhan. This indicates the 2019-nCoV could have been spreading faster than previous estimates.","publish_time":"2020-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Qingyuan; Chen, Yang; Small, Dylan S","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c85f571a674c7fed0ccb9176e9cf9f3d3659ca32.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.06.20020941","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["Wuhan","travel history","travel rate","days","reported incubation interval","confirmed cases","travel ban","estimated epidemiological parameters","credible interval","serial interval","coronavirus cases","nCoV","basic epidemiological parameters","symptom onset time","simulated infection time","different choices of incubation interval","Previous analyses","previous estimates","distribution","estimated basic reproduction number","hyperparameters","prior specification","CrI","symptom onset dates","sensitivity analysis","Bayesian analysis","novel coronavirus","simple exponential growth model","severe acute respiratory syndrome","earlier report","regions","adjustment","Macau","Japan","Korea","selected countries","uncertainty","Singapore","SARS","diffuse priors","outside China","study period","Hong Kong","important distinction","good fit","disease progress","information","data","Conclusions","epidemic","Taiwan","size","outbreak","Methods","Results","quarantine","Background"],"language":"en"},

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, J.; Zhao, S.; Liu, M.; Zhao, Z.; Xu, Y.; Wang, P.; Lin, M.; Huang, B.; Zuo, X.; Chen, Z.; Bai, F.; Cui, J.; Lew, A.

Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score \u226510 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p\u003C0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4), followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3).

Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (\u226565 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P\u003C0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P\u003C0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, P= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARS. Conclusions and Relevance: Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID. While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Jian-Min; Bai, Peng; He, Wei; Wu, Fei; Liu, Xiao-Fang; Han, De-Min; Liu, Shi; Yang, Jin-Kui","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf39a81c9aab9e0569f33d93d5e203d320dac024.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026864","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","COVID"],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","survived patients","SARS-CoV","SARS outbreak","female patients","hospitalized patients","survived group","women","deceased group","higher severity","survivors of COVID","mortality independent of age","higher mortality rate","percentages of older age","male gender","public data set","percentage of male","gender distribution","gender role","susceptibility","case series","years","risk factors","Wuhan city","Beijing city","useful prognostic factors","recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus","worse outcome","high number of comorbidities","Relevance","hazard ratio","individualized assessment","Results","Measures","deaths","Survival analysis","Main Outcomes","Importance","Participants","Conclusions","cities","China","cases","Disease","Design","Setting","world","alert","Objective"],"language":"en"},

To study how different glial cell types are affected by the disease process, we combine three-color immunofluorescence labeling with tritiated thymidine autoradiography on 1-micron frozen sections of spinal cord. We use three different glial cell specific antibodies (a) to 2\u0027,3\u0027 cyclic-nucleotide 3\u0027 phosphohydrolase (CNP) expressed by oligodendrocytes, (b) to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expressed by astrocytes, and (c) the O4 antibody which binds to O-2A progenitor cells in the rat. These progenitor cells, which give rise to oligodendrocytes and type 2 astrocytes and react with the O4 antibody in the adult central nervous system, were present but rare in the spinal cord of uninfected mice. In contrast, cells with the O-2A progenitor phenotype (O4 \u002B only) were increased in number at one week post viral inoculation (1 WPI) and were the only immunostained cells labeled at that time by a 2-h in vivo pulse of tritiated thymidine. Both GFAP\u002B only and GFAP\u002B, O4\u002B astrocytes were also increased in the spinal cord at 1 WPI. Between two and four WPI, the infected spinal cord was characterized by the loss of (CNP\u002B, O4\u002B) oligodendrocytes within demyelinating lesions and the presence of O-2A progenitor cells and O4\u002B, GFAP\u002B astrocytes, both of which could be labeled with thymidine. As remyelination proceeded, CNP immunostaining returned to near normal and tritiated thymidine injected previously during the demyelinating phase now appeared in CNP\u002B oligodendrocytes. Thus O4 positive O-2A progenitor cells proliferate early in the course of the demyelinating disease, while CNP positive oligodendrocytes do not. The timing of events suggests that the O-2A progenitors may give rise to new oligodendrocytes and to type 2 astrocytes, both of which are likely to be instrumental in the remyelination process.","publish_time":"1989-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4a46bccbf43ff75b7e20f5081f3c5b7a31b7b29.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2115831/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GFAP","CNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["progenitor cells","glial cells","astrocytes","O4 positive O","O4 antibody","CNP positive oligodendrocytes","immunostained cells","GFAP","infected spinal cord","new oligodendrocytes","spinal cord of uninfected mice","demyelinating disease","demyelinating lesions","presence of O","CNP immunostaining","progenitor phenotype","WPI","tritiated thymidine autoradiography","pulse of tritiated thymidine","micron frozen sections of spinal cord","demyelinating phase","remyelination process","different glial cell types","different glial cell specific antibodies","disease process","rise","glial fibrillary acidic protein","viral inoculation","N mice","extensive viral replication","A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus","adult central nervous system","three-color immunofluorescence","week","phosphohydrolase","progenitors","course","loss","C57 BL","number","time","cyclic-nucleotide","timing of events","rat","contrast"],"language":"en"},

When the membrane-spanning domain of a protein which is efficiently delivered to the plasma membrane (VSV G protein) is replaced with m1, the resulting chimera (Gm1) is retained in the Golgi (Swift, A. M., and C. E. Machamer. 1991. J. Cell Biol. 115:19-30). When assayed in sucrose gradients, we observed that Gm1 formed a large oligomer, and that much of this oligomer was SDS resistant and stayed near the top of the stacking gel of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The unusual stability of the oligomer allowed it to be detected easily. Gm1 mutants with single amino acid substitutions in the m1 domain that were retained in the Golgi complex formed SDS-resistant oligomers, whereas mutants that were rapidly released to the plasma membrane did not. Oligomerization was not detected immediately after synthesis of Gm1, but occurred gradually with a lag of approximately 10 min, suggesting that it is not merely aggregation of misfolded proteins. Furthermore, oligomerization did not occur under several conditions that block ER to Golgi transport. The lumenal domain was not required for oligomerization since another chimera (alpha m1G), where the lumenal domain of Gm1 was replaced by the alpha subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin, also formed an SDS-resistant oligomer, and was able to form hetero-oligomers with Gm1 as revealed by coprecipitation experiments. SDS resistance was conferred by the cytoplasmic tail of VSV G, because proteolytic digestion of the tail in microsomes containing Gm1 oligomers resulted in loss of SDS resistance, although the protease-treated material continued to migrate as a large oligomer on sucrose gradients. Interestingly, treatment of cells with cytochalasin D blocked formation of SDS-resistant (but not SDS- sensitive) oligomers. Our data suggest that SDS-resistant oligomers form as newly synthesized molecules of Gm1 arrive at the Golgi complex and may interact (directly or indirectly) with an actin-based cytoskeletal matrix. The oligomerization of Gm1 and other resident proteins could serve as a mechanism for their retention in the Golgi complex.","publish_time":"1993-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bfeba839c9c98eb6e49ceb13cfcdba28620a61d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2119850/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

A slight pathologic reaction occurred in the brains of intracerebrally injected Princeton mice, but it was negligible compared with that of the ensuing hepatitis. In Swiss mice, injected intracerebrally with a mixture of MHV (Pr) and Eperythrozoon coccoides, a related virus with restricted pathogenicity and host range, possibly a mutant, was isolated from the liver and brain. MHV (C), an actively hepatotropic virus recovered from leukemic Balb C mice, was much more neurotropic than MHV (Pr). Intracerebral injection of Balb C and Swiss weanling mice was attended by marked leptomeningeal and encephalitic lesions. Paralysis of the extremities occurred in some of the animals. The virus was essentially inactive in Princeton mice. During the intracerebral passage of MHV (C) in Swiss mice a pleuropneumonia-like organism was isolated from the brain. In conjunction with the virus this organism produced a vigorous leukocytic reaction.","publish_time":"1955-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nelson, John B.","journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2136532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Princeton"],"locations":["Princeton"],"keyphrases":["Swiss mice","Swiss weanling mice","leukemic Balb C mice","intracerebral passage of MHV","brains of intracerebrally injected Princeton mice","related virus","hepatotropic virus","behavior of MHV","mixture of MHV","Intracerebral injection of Balb C","organism","Intracerebral multiplication","cerebral tissue of Princeton","intraperitoneal injection","cranial passage","vigorous leukocytic reaction","slight pathologic reaction","host range","restricted pathogenicity","Eperythrozoon coccoides","difficulty","outward signs of nervous disorder","limited neurotropism","pleuropneumonia","mutant","extremities","encephalitic lesions","liver","Observations","conjunction","ensuing hepatitis","Paralysis","animals"],"language":"en"},

The results clearly document an inverse correlation of age with the incidence of SGVHD. Virtually a 100% incidence of SGVHD occurs in Lewis rats when syngeneic BMT and CsA therapy are started when the animals are 4 wk of age. Thereafter, there is a dramatic decline in the incidence of SGVHD with the increasing age of the animals. Although the age of the recipient was important, the most significant effect was the age of the marrow donor. Marrow from animals 6 mo of age was virtually incapable of eliciting SGVHD after BMT and CsA therapy. Furthermore, mixing the marrow from mature and immature animals resulted in a decreased incidence of SGVHD, implicating a regulatory effect present in the marrow from older rats. This regulatory effect was due to the presence of mature T cells in the marrow from animals 6 mo of age. Despite the fact that marrow from young animals possesses mature T lymphocytes, this regulatory activity was absent, suggesting that the host resistance mediated by T lymphocytes develops as the animal ages. These data further implicate the importance of a host resistance mechanism in preventing the induction of SGVHD with CsA, which appears to be mediated by the clonal inactivation of autoreactive cells.","publish_time":"1990-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbaa88d5b0e10a260606dc92d0774816a3bb5861.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2188172/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["BMT","CsA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of age","mo of age","induction of SGVHD","increasing age","wk of age","decreased incidence of SGVHD","marrow donor","young animals","immature animals","CsA therapy","inverse correlation of age","syngeneic BMT","syngeneic bone marrow transplantation","incapable of eliciting SGVHD","regulatory effect present","mature T lymphocytes","significant effect","presence of mature T cells","induction of syngeneic graft","host disease","host resistance mechanism","regulatory activity","Lewis rats","older rats","present studies","clonal inactivation of autoreactive cells","cyclosporine","importance","animal ages","recipient","dramatic decline","fact","results","data"],"language":"en"},

Large granular lymphocytes (LGL) of both natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) phenotypes were found to accumulate in livers of mice infected with either the nonhepatotropic Armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-ARM) or the hepatotropic WE strain (LCMV-WE). Between days 1 and 5 postinfection (p.i.), both viruses induced a three- to fourfold increase in NK cell lytic activity in the livers of C3H/St mice and a three- to fourfold increase in the number of LGL in the organ. These LGL were characterized as NK cells on the basis of cell surface antigens, kinetics of appearance, target cell range, and morphology. By day 7 p.i., virus-specific, H-2-restricted, Thy-1\u002B, Lyt-2\u002B, CTL activity was present in the liver, and its appearance correlated with a second wave of LGL accumulation. CTL activity, total leukocyte number, and CTL/LGL number were at least fivefold higher in the livers of mice infected with LCMV-WE than with LCMV-ARM. The dramatic LCMV-WE-induced day 7 increases in total leukocytes and LGL were absent in athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, suggesting that the increases were T cell-dependent. LCMV- ARM infection of C57BL/6 mice induced significant spleen CTL activity but little liver CTL activity, whereas LCMV-WE infection resulted in significant liver CTL activity but minimal spleen CTL activity. Mice infected with the cytopathic hepatotropic viruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), experienced much greater increases in liver NK/LGL by day 3 p.i. than did mice infected with LCMV or injected with the interferon-inducer poly(I-C). MHV-infected mice homozygous for the beige (bg/bg) mutation also exhibited significant increases in liver NK/LGL cell number and activity, although the activity was less than heterozygote controls, and the morphology of the LGL granules was aberrant. These data show that the LGL accumulate in virus-infected organs, in this case, the liver. An early NK/LGL influx is most pronounced during infection with cytopathic hepatotropic viruses. This initial influx of NK/LGL is followed later by an influx of CTL also possessing LGL morphology. The CTL/LGL response in the liver is significantly greater during hepatotropic virus infections, even when a strong CTL response in the spleen is lacking.","publish_time":"1986-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82cbe1246161db97802be78d3cdc2a97dd816208.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2188440/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","LGL","CTL/LGL","NK/LGL","LCMV","I-C","CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of LGL","LGL number","LGL influx","LGL morphology","LGL cell number","LGL response","significant liver CTL activity","LGL granules","little liver CTL activity","liver NK","influx of CTL","significant spleen CTL activity","livers of mice","minimal spleen CTL activity","NK cell lytic activity","livers of virus","wave of LGL accumulation","St mice","LCMV-ARM","virus-infected organs","MHV-infected mice homozygous","strong CTL response","dramatic LCMV","virus-induced hepatitis","NK cells","virus-specific","early NK","hepatotropic virus infections","initial influx of NK","significant increases","LCMV- ARM infection of C57BL","induced day","mouse hepatitis virus","T cell-dependent","greater increases","cytopathic hepatotropic viruses","target cell range","livers of C3H","total leukocyte number","basis of cell surface antigens","nonhepatotropic Armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","total leukocytes","bg","fourfold increase","antigenic phenotypes of leukocytes","cytotoxic T lymphocyte","kinetics of appearance","cytotoxic capabilities","beige","mutation","MCMV","athymic nude","natural killer","murine cytomegalovirus","immunologic mechanisms","Large granular lymphocytes","interferon-inducer poly","heterozygote controls","case","postinfection","days","data"],"language":"en"},

TNF-alpha exerts damaging effects on oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cell of the central nervous system (CNS), and myelin itself. We have recently demonstrated TNF- alpha expression from astrocytes induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta). Astrocytes secrete TNF-alpha in response to LPS alone, and can be primed by IFN-gamma to enhance LPS-induced TNF-alpha production. IFN- gamma and IL-1 beta, cytokines known to be present in the CNS during neurological disease states, do not induce TNF-alpha production alone, but act synergistically to stimulate astrocyte TNF-alpha expression. Inbred Lewis and Brown-Norway (BN) rats differ in genetic susceptibility to EAE, which is controlled in part by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. We examined TNF-alpha gene expression by astrocytes derived from BN rats (resistant to EAE) and Lewis rats (highly susceptible). Astrocytes from BN rats express TNF- alpha mRNA and protein in response to LPS alone, yet IFN-gamma does not significantly enhance LPS-induced TNF-alpha expression, nor do they express appreciable TNF-alpha in response to the combined stimuli of IFN-gamma/IL-1 beta. In contrast, astrocytes from Lewis rats express low levels of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein in response to LPS, and are extremely responsive to the priming effect of IFN-gamma for subsequent TNF-alpha gene expression. Also, Lewis astrocytes produce TNF-alpha in response to IFN-gamma/IL-1 beta. The differential TNF-alpha production by astrocytes from BN and Lewis strains is not due to the suppressive effect of prostaglandins, because the addition of indomethacin does not alter the differential pattern of TNF-alpha expression. Furthermore, Lewis and BN astrocytes produce another cytokine, IL-6, in response to LPS, IFN-gamma, and IL-1 beta in a comparable fashion. Peritoneal macrophages and neonatal microglia from Lewis and BN rats are responsive to both LPS and IFN-gamma priming signals for subsequent TNF- alpha production, suggesting that differential TNF-alpha expression by the astrocyte is cell type specific. Taken together, these results suggest that differential TNF-alpha gene expression in response to LPS and IFN-gamma is strain and cell specific, and reflects both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","publish_time":"1991-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Exp Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1425915f5f44c6e2bb0753cbe0531cbcbad46d13.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2190814/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lewis"],"organizations":["CNS","EAE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TNF- alpha expression","TNF- alpha mRNA","appreciable TNF-alpha","differential TNF-alpha expression","astrocyte TNF-alpha expression","LPS-induced TNF-alpha expression","differential TNF-alpha production","subsequent TNF- alpha production","LPS-induced TNF-alpha production","differential TNF-alpha gene expression","IFN- gamma","subsequent TNF-alpha gene expression","differential pattern of TNF","Lewis astrocytes","response","BN astrocytes","low levels of TNF","Lewis rats","BN rats","interferon gamma","IFN-gamma priming signals","beta","cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha","priming effect of IFN","Lewis strains","combined stimuli of IFN","Inbred Lewis","EAE","cell specific","protein","CNS","cell type specific","myelin","neurological disease states","suppressive effect of prostaglandins","post-transcriptional control mechanisms","pathogenesis of neurological autoimmune diseases","multiple sclerosis","neonatal microglia","lipopolysaccharide","experimental allergic encephalomyelitis","oligodendrocytes","Brown-Norway","damaging effects","central nervous system","major histocompatibility complex","MHC","evidence","Peritoneal macrophages","genetic susceptibility","interleukin","addition of indomethacin","cytokines","contrast","results","comparable fashion","WORDS"],"language":"en"},

Animal models of MS have shown that CNS-specific T cells are present in the peripheral T cell repertoire of healthy mice and cause autoimmune disease only when they are activated by immunization. T cell entry into the CNS is thought to require some form of peripheral activation because the blood\u2013brain barrier prohibits trafficking of this tissue by naive cells. We report here that naive T cells can traffic to the CNS without prior activation. Comparable numbers of T cells are found in the CNS of both healthy recombinase activating gene (Rag)(\u2212/)\u2212 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice and nontransgenic mice even when the transgenic TCR is specific for a CNS antigen. Transgenic T cells isolated from the CNS that are specific for non-CNS antigens are phenotypically naive and proliferate robustly to antigenic stimulation in vitro. Strikingly, transgenic T cells isolated from the CNS that are specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) are also primarily phenotypically naive but are unresponsive to antigenic stimulation in vitro.

The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency and clinical relevance of HBoV infection in adult patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD). METHODS: We retrospectively tested 212 COPD patients, 141 (66.5%) with AE-COPD and 71 (33.5%) with stable disease, of whom nasal lavage and induced sputum had been obtained for the presence of HBoV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The specificity of positive polymerase chain reaction results was confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: Two hundred two of 212 patients for whom PCR results were available both for nasal lavage and induced sputum samples were eligible for data analysis. HBoV DNA was detected in three patients (1.5%). Of those, only one patient had AE-COPD. Thus, the frequency of HBoV infection demonstrated to be low in both AE-COPD (0.8%) and stable COPD (2.9%). HBoV was found in two sputum and one nasal lavage sample in different patients, respectively. Sequencing revealed \u003E99% sequence identity with the reference strain. CONCLUSION: HBoV detection was infrequent. Since we detected HBoV in both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in AE-COPD as well as stable disease, a major role of HBoV infection in adults with AE-COPD is unlikely.","publish_time":"2009-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ringshausen, Felix C; Tan, Ai-Yui M; Allander, Tobias; Borg, Irmgard; Arinir, Umut; Kronsbein, Juliane; Hauptmeier, Barbara M; Schultze-Werninghaus, Gerhard; Rohde, Gernot","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07fe504a3b64db4dd23da77929893eb89215f3be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2672801.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672801/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjszODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AE-COPD","COPD patients","HBoV DNA","stable COPD","HBoV detection","frequency of HBoV infection","major role of HBoV infection","clinical relevance of HBoV infection","adult patients","stable disease","presence of HBoV deoxyribonucleic acid","different patients","nasal lavage sample","induced sputum samples","PCR results","sequencing","OBJECTIVE","acute respiratory tract infections","acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","lower respiratory tract specimens","specificity of positive polymerase chain reaction results","adults","discovered parvovirus","data analysis","sequence identity","children","reference strain","present study","CONCLUSION","Human bocavirus","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Two important case studies show the versatility and functionalities of RNAVLab. The first study quantifies its capability to rebuild longer secondary structures from motifs found in systematically sampled nucleotide segments.

XBP-1S, the active isoform of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1), is a key regulator of UPR. Previously, we showed that a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), binds to XBP-1S and functions as an activator of XBP-1S. Here, we identify general control nonderepressible 5 (GCN5), a HAT with 73% identity to PCAF, as a novel XBP-1S regulator. Both PCAF and GCN5 bind to the same domain of XBP-1S. Surprisingly, GCN5 potently blocks the XBP-1S-mediated transcription, including cellular UPR genes and latent membrane protein 1 of Epstein-Barr virus. Unlike PCAF, GCN5 acetylates XBP-1S and enhances nuclear retention and protein stability of XBP-1S. However, such GCN5-mediated acetylation of XBP-1S shows no effects on XBP-1S activity. In addition, the HAT activity of GCN5 is not required for repression of XBP-1S target genes. We further demonstrate that GCN5 inhibits XBP-1S-mediated transcription by disrupting the PCAF-XBP-1S interaction and preventing the recruitment of XBP-1S to its target genes. Taken together, our results represent the first work demonstrating that GCN5 and PCAF exhibit different functions and antagonistically regulate the XBP-1S-mediated transcription.","publish_time":"2014-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lew, Qiao Jing; Chu, Kai Ling; Chia, Yi Ling; Soo, Benjamin; Ho, Jia Pei; Ng, Chew Har; Kwok, Hui Si; Chiang, Cheng-Ming; Chang, Yao; Chao, Sheng-Hao","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9708301ac6326b1214f31ab93fcd4b72485cf4b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4381594.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4381594/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR","PCAF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCAF-XBP","novel XBP","recruitment of XBP","repression of XBP","activator of XBP","domain of XBP","GCN5-mediated acetylation of XBP","protein stability of XBP","S activity","S regulator","S interaction","S-mediated transcription","S target genes","HAT activity of GCN5","cellular UPR genes","latent membrane protein","box binding protein","Cellular unfolded protein response","key regulator of UPR","different functions","p300","active isoform of X","nuclear retention","effects","CBP-associated factor","Epstein-Barr virus","endoplasmic reticulum","histone acetyltransferase","general control nonderepressible","identity","work","addition","stress","results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Twelve relevant manuscripts were sourced from a total of 7288 search results obtained using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar. The search keywords used were COVID-19, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, swabs, SARS and CoV2. Original manuscripts were obtained and analysed by all authors. The review included manuscripts which have not undergone rigorous peer-review process in view of the magnitude of the topic discussed. RESULTS The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract was significantly higher during the first week and peaked at 4-6 days after onset of symptoms, during which it can be potentially sampled. Nasopharyngeal swab has demonstrated higher viral load than oropharyngeal swab, where the difference in paired samples is best seen at 0-9 days after the onset of illness. Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab was higher than oropharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 patients. Patient self-collected throat washing has been shown to contain higher viral load than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, with significantly higher sensitivity when compared with paired nasopharyngeal swab. RECOMMENDATIONS Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID-19 infection should take anatomy of the nasal cavity into consideration to increase patient comfort and diagnostic yield. Routine oropharyngeal swab should be replaced by throat washing which has demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy, and it is safe towards others.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mawaddah, A; Gendeh, H S; Lum, S G; Marina, M B","journal":"The Malaysian journal of pathology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342928/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs5OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google Scholar"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab","paired nasopharyngeal swab","Routine oropharyngeal swab","higher viral load","RECOMMENDATIONS Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID","oropharyngeal swabs","higher sensitivity","viral load of SARS","relevant manuscripts","search results","Original manuscripts","days","upper respiratory tract sampling","Patient self-collected throat washing","patient comfort","rigorous peer-review process","diagnostic yield","diagnostic accuracy","paired samples","search keywords","onset of symptoms","onset of illness","consideration","present literature","healthcare practices","directions","nasal cavity","PubMed","Medline","anatomy","RNA","infection","future studies","magnitude","total","difference","Google Scholar","CoV2","patients","topic","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","week","authors"],"language":"en"},

We attribute the effect to a Reed-Hughes-like mechanism in which disease arrives at different times and grows exponentially.

Detecting COVID-19 at early stage is essential to deliver proper healthcare to the patients and also to protect the uninfected population. To this end, we develop a dual-sampling attention network to automatically diagnose COVID- 19 from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in chest computed tomography (CT). In particular, we propose a novel online attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the imbalanced learning. Our method is evaluated (to our best knowledge) upon the largest multi-center CT data for COVID-19 from 8 hospitals. In the training-validation stage, we collect 2186 CT scans from 1588 patients for a 5-fold cross-validation. In the testing stage, we employ another independent large-scale testing dataset including 2796 CT scans from 2057 patients.

Despite these continuous advancements for COVID-19 screening, many concerns remain about model reliability when used in a clinical setting. Much has been published, but with limited transparency in expected model performance. We set out to address this limitation through a set of experiments to quantify baseline performance metrics and variability for COVID-19 detection in chest x-ray for 12 common deep learning architectures. Specifically, we adopted an experimental paradigm controlling for train-validation-test split and model architecture where the source of prediction variability originates from model weight initialization, random data augmentation transformations, and batch shuffling. Each model architecture was trained 5 separate times on identical train-validation-test splits of a publicly available x-ray image dataset provided by Cohen et al. (2020). Results indicate that even within model architectures, model behavior varies in a meaningful way between trained models. Best performing models achieve a false negative rate of 3 out of 20 for detecting COVID-19 in a hold-out set. While these results show promise in using AI for COVID-19 screening, they further support the urgent need for diverse medical imaging datasets for model training in a way that yields consistent prediction outcomes. It is our hope that these modeling results accelerate work in building a more robust dataset and a viable screening tool for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goodwin, Brian D; Jaskolski, Corey; Zhong, Can; Asmani, Herick","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac28c41a38cdbae61be7145096661508a213ecb8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02167v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cohen"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","model architectures","model training","model behavior","model reliability","expected model performance","model weight initialization","chest x-ray","viable screening tool","trained models","set of experiments","modeling results","available x-ray image dataset","identical train-validation","source of prediction variability","test splits","meaningful way","robust dataset","AI research","baseline performance metrics","Best performing models","consistent prediction outcomes","common deep learning architectures","random data augmentation transformations","diverse medical imaging datasets","separate times","urgent need","start","work","significant traction","technologies","detection","false negative rate","batch shuffling","computed tomography","Cohen","limited transparency","concerns","hope","experimental paradigm","continuous advancements","promise","coronavirus pandemic","clinical setting","limitation","hold"],"language":"en"},

Here we consider a structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and \\pairGU-base pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base pairs. These interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the whole spectrum of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA structures, searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of interest to find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze their induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding algorithms, {\\tt RNAinverse}, {\\tt RNA-SSD} as well as {\\tt INFO-RNA} are limited to RNA secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse folding algorithm {\\tt Inv} which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures. Results: In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm {\\tt Inv}. We give a detailed analysis of {\\tt Inv}, including pseudocodes. We show that {\\tt Inv} allows to design in particular 3-noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot 3-noncrossing RNA structures--a class which is difficult to construct via dynamic programming routines. {\\tt Inv} is freely available at \\url{http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/inv.html}.

As a result, {\\tt Inv} is not only able to find novel sequences even for RNA secondary structures, it does so in the context of competing structures that potentially exhibit cross-serial interactions.","publish_time":"2010-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, James Z.M.; Li, Linda Y.M.; Reidys, Christian M.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/466dc1e5c227ca49cd0fc535dd402f5049b9161b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.2015v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tt Inv","noncrossing RNA structures","tt RNA-SSD","tt INFO-RNA","RNA pseudoknot structures","RNA secondary structures","RNA sequences","natural RNA structures","artificial RNA","tt RNAinverse","noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot","spectrum of RNA functionalities","canonical pseudoknot structures","context of competing structures","inverse folding capabilities","established inverse folding algorithms","noncrossing Watson-Crick","specific structure","paper","cross-serial interactions","additional cross-serial base pairs","new ribozymes","new ideas","novel sequences","pairGU-base pairings","instance","class","variety of structural configurations","dynamic programming routines","induced neutral networks","detailed analysis","Background","comparison","Conclusions","pseudocodes","url","pseudoknots","Results"],"language":"en"},

Outside of this region, the Newton method has to be damped in order to ensure convergence. However, the available estimates of both the size of the convergence region and the step length to be used outside of it are based on conservative relations between the Hessians at different points and are hence sub-optimal. In this contribution we use methods of optimal control theory to compute the optimal step length of the Newton method on the class of self-concordant functions, as a function of the Newton decrement. With this step length quadratic convergence can be achieved on the whole Dikin ellipsoid. The exact bounds are expressed in terms of solutions of ordinary differential equations which cannot be integrated explicitly. As an application, the neighbourhood of the central path in which the iterates of short-step interior point methods for conic programming are required to stay can be enlarged, enabling faster progress along the central path during each iteration and hence fewer iterations to achieve a given accuracy.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hildebrand, Roland","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d147c8ef75dcafc0cb431bf0067e68e5004bd7dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08650v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Newton"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimal step length","step length quadratic convergence","exact Newton method","quadratic convergence region","Newton decrement","central path","Dikin ellipsoid","short-step interior point methods","methods of optimal control theory","class of self-concordant functions","exact bounds","minimum","terms of solutions","different points","conic programming","fraction","fewer iterations","Hessians","ordinary differential equations","size","conservative relations","given accuracy","neighbourhood","faster progress","contribution","available estimates","application","order"],"language":"en"},

Limited testing capacity across the country has been widely identified as a key driver of suppressed coronavirus case-counts. The calls to increase testing capacity are well-justified as they become a more frequent point of discussion in the public sphere. While expanded testing is a laudable goal, selection bias will impact estimates of disease prevalence and the effective reproduction number until the entire population is sampled. Moreover, tests are imperfect as false positive/negative rates interact in complex ways with selection bias. In this paper, we attempt to clarify this interaction. Through simple calculations, we demonstrate pitfalls and paradoxes that can arise when considering case-count data in the presence of selection bias and measurement error.

METHODS We developed a modified stacked auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19 across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure. RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting, the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted that the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the forecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19, 2020. The 34 provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters. CONCLUSIONS The accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was high. We predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of April. If the data are reliable and there are no second transmissions, we can accurately forecast the transmission dynamics of the Covid-19 across the provinces/cities in China. The AI-inspired methods are a powerful tool for helping public health planning and policymaking.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Zixin; Ge, Qiyang; Li, Shudi; Jin, Li; Xiong, Momiao","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a59ca238c64e4bae304240d7df787cf0345d50e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.07112v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["transmission dynamics of Covid","real-time forecasting of Covid","time of Covid","epidemics of Covid","China","trajectory of Covid","cities","multiple-step forecasting","provinces","AI-inspired methods","curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid","transmission structure","AI-based methods","forecasted transmission dynamic curves","data","modified stacked auto-encoder","time points","powerful tool","epidemiological models","plateau","estimated average errors","public health planning","alternative","clustering algorithms","artificial intelligence","accuracy","policymaking","BACKGROUND","latent variables","size","lengths","CONCLUSIONS","transmissions","clusters","middle"],"language":"en"},

Distributed in mid-April 2020, the survey solicited information about how scientists\u0027 work changed from the onset of the pandemic, how their research output might be affected in the near future, and a wide range of individuals\u0027 characteristics. Scientists report a sharp decline in time spent on research on average, but there is substantial heterogeneity with a significant share reporting no change or even increases. Some of this heterogeneity is due to field-specific differences, with laboratory-based fields being the most negatively affected, and some is due to gender, with female scientists reporting larger declines. However, among the individuals\u0027 characteristics examined, the largest disruptions are connected to a usually unobserved dimension: childcare. Reporting a young dependent is associated with declines similar in magnitude to those reported by the laboratory-based fields and can account for a significant fraction of gender differences.

One of the methods used to inactivate viruses is exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation to damage their nucleic acids. Although gamma-rays effectively induce lesions in the RNA, envelope proteins are also highly damaged in the process. This in turn may alter their antigenic properties, affecting their capacity to induce an adaptive immune response able to confer effective protection. Here, we modelled the impact of sparsely and densely ionizing radiation on SARS-CoV-2 using the Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA. With a realistic 3D target virus model, we calculated the expected number of lesions in the spike and membrane proteins, as well as in the viral RNA. We show that gamma-rays produce significant spike protein damage, but densely ionizing charged particles induce less membrane damage for the same level of RNA lesions, because a single ion traversal through the nuclear envelope is sufficient to inactivate the virus. We propose that accelerated charged particles produce inactivated viruses with little structural damage to envelope proteins, thereby representing a new and effective tool for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Francis, Ziad; Incerti, Sebastien; Zein, Sara A.; Lampe, Nathanael; Guzman, Carlos A.; Durante, Marco","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5326515d4062391a68718f5e8c1c1d73b4143d88.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06201v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Monte Carlo"],"keyphrases":["envelope proteins","membrane damage","SARS-CoV","inactivated viruses","membrane proteins","ionizing charged particles","level of RNA lesions","little structural damage","nuclear envelope","significant spike protein damage","enveloped viruses","gamma-rays","viral RNA","high doses of ionizing radiation","accelerated charged particles","expected number of lesions","effective protection","effective tool","D target virus model","exposure","single ion traversal","adaptive immune response able","capacity","vaccines","Monte Carlo toolkit Geant4-DNA","antigenic properties","nucleic acids","turn","methods","Immunization","strategies","impact","process"],"language":"en"},

From a few 2D microscopy scans, we learn statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the outer membrane shape, spatial properties and distribution characteristics of the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in 3D model construction. Once all imaging evidence is incorporated in the model, additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining rules that spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual interactions among macromolecules, their distances and orientations to other structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive visualization and modeling feedback loop.

A stylized asset pricing model suggests that the stock price temporarily decreases by 50% in the benchmark case but shows a W-shaped, moderate but longer bear market under the optimal policy.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toda, Alexis Akira","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da2656c9717e39f06b7a2f7b042e9e9495717d2c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11221v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["benchmark model","epidemic model","optimal policy","peak","optimal mitigation policy","stylized asset pricing model","recovery rate","transmission rate","benchmark case","Susceptible-Infected","timing","SIR","Coronavirus Disease","countries","W-shaped","market","stock price","intensity of social distancing","COVID","fast spread","healthcare system","population"],"language":"en"},

The scarcity of resources and lack of experiences to endure the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the fear of future consequences has established the need for adoption of emerging and future technologies to address the upcoming challenges. Since the last five months, the amount of pandemic impact has reached its pinnacle that is altering everyone\u0027s life; and humans are now bound to adopt safe ways to survive under the risk of being affected. Technological advances are now accelerating faster than ever before to stay ahead of the consequences and acquire new capabilities to build a safer world. Thus, there is a rising need to unfold the power of emerging, future and disruptive technologies to explore all possible ways to fight against COVID-19. In this review article, we attempt to study all emerging, future, and disruptive technologies that can be utilized to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Building on background insights, detailed technological specific use cases to fight against COVID-19 have been discussed in terms of their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). As concluding remarks, we highlight prioritized research areas and upcoming opportunities to blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological domain-specific challenges and also illuminate collaborative research directions for moving towards a post-COVID-19 world.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agarwal, Sonali; Punn, Narinder Singh; Sonbhadra, Sanjay Kumar; Nagabhushan, P.; Pandian, K K Soundra; Saxena, Praveer","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32ed32945ad1a8bbb6877b1642c1e8f4471a6860.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11507v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["impact of COVID","future technologies","post-COVID","disruptive technologies","pandemic impact","fear of future consequences","upcoming opportunities","upcoming challenges","power of emerging","adoption of emerging","global pandemic","biological domain-specific challenges","Technological advances","rising need","possible ways","safe ways","safer world","detailed technological specific use cases","prioritized research areas","collaborative research directions","placed government agencies","background insights","matter of grave concern","weaknesses","new capabilities","lines","lack of experiences","novel coronavirus","precarious position","concluding remarks","unprecedented outbreak","scarcity of resources","strengths","threats","pinnacle","humans","Wuhan","China","life","terms","risk","SWOT","months","review article"],"language":"en"},

The problem is motivated by the practice in the video game industry, where a retailer offers discounts on selected supportive products (e.g. video games) to customers who have also purchased the core products (e.g. video game consoles). We formulate this problem as an optimization problem to determine the prices of different products and the selection of products with add-on discounts. To overcome the computational challenge of this optimization problem, we propose an efficient FPTAS algorithm that can solve the problem approximately to any desired accuracy. Moreover, we consider the revenue management problem in the setting where the retailer has no prior knowledge of the demand functions of different products. To resolve this problem, we propose a UCB-based learning algorithm that uses the FPTAS optimization algorithm as a subroutine. We show that our learning algorithm can converge to the optimal algorithm that has access to the true demand functions, and we prove that the convergence rate is tight up to a certain logarithmic term. In addition, we conduct numerical experiments with the real-world transaction data we collect from a popular video gaming brand\u0027s online store on Tmall.com. The experiment results illustrate our learning algorithm\u0027s robust performance and fast convergence in various scenarios. We also compare our algorithm with the optimal policy that does not use any add-on discount, and the results show the advantages of using the add-on discount strategy in practice.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Simchi-Levi, David; Sun, Rui; Zhang, Huanan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00947v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FPTAS","Tmall.com"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimization problem","revenue management problem","optimal algorithm","FPTAS optimization algorithm","add-on discounts","selection of products","core products","efficient FPTAS algorithm","demand functions of different products","UCB-based learning algorithm","prices of different products","video games","selected supportive products","video game industry","video game consoles","add-on discount strategy","retailer","practice","true demand functions","learning algorithm\u0027s robust performance","popular video gaming brand\u0027s online store","fast convergence","experiment results","convergence rate","optimal policy","numerical experiments","real-world transaction data","prior knowledge","access","setting","various scenarios","advantages","paper","certain logarithmic term","customers","computational challenge","subroutine","addition","desired accuracy"],"language":"en"},

However, developing novel drugs is a costly and lengthy process, and is unlikely to deliver a timely treatment for the pandemic. Drug repurposing, by contrast, provides an attractive alternative, as existing drugs have already undergone many of the regulatory requirements. In this work we used a combination of network algorithms and human curation to search integrated knowledge graphs, identifying drug repurposing opportunities for COVID-19.

In this paper, we discuss how by just applying this training regime to a basic model like Complex gives near SOTA performance on all the datasets -- we call this model COMPLEX-V2. We also highlight how various multiplicative methods recently proposed in literature benefit from this trick and become indistinguishable in terms of performance on most datasets.

The fatality rate due to SARS and MERS were higher than COVID-19 however, the spread of those were limited to few countries while COVID-19 affected more than two-hundred countries of the world. In this work, authors used deep machine learning algorithms along with innovative image pre-processing techniques to distinguish COVID-19 images from SARS and MERS images. Several deep learning algorithms were trained, and tested and four outperforming algorithms were reported: SqueezeNet, ResNet18, Inceptionv3 and DenseNet201. Original, Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalized and complemented image were used individually and in concatenation as the inputs to the networks. It was observed that inceptionv3 outperforms all networks for 3-channel concatenation technique and provide an excellent sensitivity of 99.5%, 93.1% and 97% for classifying COVID-19, MERS and SARS images respectively. Investigating deep layer activation mapping of the correctly classified images and miss-classified images, it was observed that some overlapping features between COVID-19 and MERS images were identified by the deep layer network. Interestingly these features were present in MERS images and 10 out of 144 images were miss-classified as COVID while only one out of 423 COVID-19 images was miss-classified as MERS. None of the MERS images was miss-classified to SARS and only one COVID-19 image was miss-classified as SARS.

There are several factors involved in the epidemic spreading such as the individual characteristics of each city/country. The true shape of the epidemic dynamics is a large, complex system such as most of the social systems. In this context, Complex networks are a great candidate to analyze these systems due to their ability to tackle structural and dynamical properties. Therefore this study presents a new approach to model the COVID-19 epidemic using a multi-layer complex network, where nodes represent people, edges are social contacts, and layers represent different social activities. The model improves the traditional SIR and it is applied to study the Brazilian epidemic by analyzing possible future actions and their consequences. The network is characterized using statistics of infection, death, and hospitalization time. To simulate isolation, social distancing, or precautionary measures we remove layers and/or reduce the intensity of social contacts. Results show that even taking various optimistic assumptions, the current isolation levels in Brazil still may lead to a critical scenario for the healthcare system and a considerable death toll (average of 149,000). If all activities return to normal, the epidemic growth may suffer a steep increase, and the demand for ICU beds may surpass 3 times the country\u0027s capacity. This would surely lead to a catastrophic scenario, as our estimation reaches an average of 212,000 deaths even considering that all cases are effectively treated. The increase of isolation (up to a lockdown) shows to be the best option to keep the situation under the healthcare system capacity, aside from ensuring a faster decrease of new case occurrences (months of difference), and a significantly smaller death toll (average of 87,000).","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scabini, Leonardo F.

We find that an epidemic outbreak on the contact layer can induce an outbreak on the communication layer, and information spreading can effectively raise the epidemic threshold. When structural correlation exists between the two layers, the information threshold remains unchanged but the epidemic threshold can be enhanced, making the contact layer more resilient to epidemic outbreak.

Achieving containment demands accurate and timely collection of the infected individual\u0027s location and contact history. Traditionally, this process is labor intensive, susceptible to memory errors, and fraught with privacy concerns. With the recent almost ubiquitous availability of smart phones, many people carry a tool which can be utilized to quickly identify an infected individual\u0027s contacts during an epidemic, such as the current 2019 novel Coronavirus crisis. Unfortunately, the very same first-generation contact tracing tools have been used to expand mass surveillance, limit individual freedoms and expose the most private details about individuals. We seek to outline the different technological approaches to mobile-phone based contact-tracing to date and elaborate on the opportunities and the risks that these technologies pose to individuals and societies. We describe advanced security enhancing approaches that can mitigate these risks and describe trade-offs one must make when developing and deploying any mass contact-tracing technology.

We use MERCURIAL to analyse 101,767 tweets from Italy, the first country to react to the COVID-19 threat with a nationwide lockdown. The data were collected between 11th and 17th March, immediately after the announcement of the Italian lockdown and the WHO declaring COVID-19 a pandemic. Our analysis provides unique insights into the psychological burden of this crisis, focussing on: (i) the Italian official campaign for self-quarantine (#iorestoacasa}), (ii) national lockdown (#italylockdown), and (iii) social denounce (#sciacalli). Our exploration unveils evidence for the emergence of complex emotional profiles, where anger and fear (towards political debates and socio-economic repercussions) coexisted with trust, solidarity, and hope (related to the institutions and local communities). We discuss our findings in relation to mental well-being issues and coping mechanisms, like instigation to violence, grieving, and solidarity.

In particular, we assume that an epidemic spreads stochastically on a scale-free network and that each infected individual in the network gains a temporary immunity after its infectious period is over. After the temporary immunity period is over, the individual becomes susceptible to the virus again. When the underlying contact network is embedded in Euclidean geometry, we model three different intervention strategies that aim to control the spread of the epidemic: social distancing, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on maximal number of social contacts per node. Our first finding is that on a finite network, a long enough average immunity period leads to extinction of the pandemic after the first peak, analogous to the concept of\u0022herd immunity\u0022. For each model, there is a critical average immunity length $L_c$ above which this happens. Our second finding is that all three interventions manage to flatten the first peak (the travel restrictions most efficiently), as well as decrease the critical immunity length $L_c$, but elongate the epidemic. However, when the average immunity length $L$ is shorter than $L_c$, the price for the flattened first peak is often a high second peak: for limiting the maximal number of contacts, the second peak can be as high as 1/3 of the first peak, and twice as high as it would be without intervention. Thirdly, interventions introduce oscillations into the system and the time to reach equilibrium is, for almost all scenarios, much longer. We conclude that network-based epidemic models can show a variety of behaviors that are not captured by the continuous compartmental models.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hulshof, Tim; Jorritsma, Joost; Komj\u0027athy, J\u0027ulia","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a54c8af152f3f4b7ed86d4ff92f3037aaf87bb1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06880v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peak","temporary immunity period","average immunity period","herd immunity","critical immunity length","finite network","critical average immunity length","epidemic models","non-spatial network models","epidemic spreads","scale-free network","underlying contact network","travel restrictions","maximal number of social contacts","maximal number of contacts","infectious period","interventions","finding","continuous compartmental models","social distancing","infected individual","different intervention strategies","Euclidean geometry","system","pandemic","node","concept","extinction","COVID","simulation study","equilibrium","time","oscillations","price","variety of behaviors","paper","virus","scenarios"],"language":"en"},

In the early phase, many countries employed manual contact tracing to contain the rate of disease spread, however it has many issues. The manual approach is cumbersome, time consuming and also requires active participation of a large number of people to realize it. In order to overcome these drawbacks, digital contact tracing has been proposed that typically involves deploying a contact tracing application on people\u0027s mobile devices which can track their movements and close social interactions. While studies suggest that digital contact tracing is more effective than manual contact tracing, it has been observed that higher adoption rates of the contact tracing app may result in a better controlled epidemic. This also increases the confidence in the accuracy of the collected data and the subsequent analytics. One key reason for low adoption rate of contact tracing applications is the concern about individual privacy. In fact, several studies report that contact tracing applications deployed in multiple countries are not privacy friendly and have potential to be used for mass surveillance by the concerned governments. Hence, privacy respecting contact tracing application is the need of the hour that can lead to highly effective, efficient contact tracing. As part of this study, we focus on various cryptographic techniques that can help in addressing the Private Set Intersection problem which lies at the heart of privacy respecting contact tracing. We analyze the computation and communication complexities of these techniques under the typical client-server architecture utilized by contact tracing applications. Further we evaluate those computation and communication complexity expressions for India scenario and thus identify cryptographic techniques that can be more suitably deployed there.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"RajanM, A; Shukla, Manish; Lodha, Sachin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b2e1a39c367ddb856c0bac7abf1ba510d6ce025.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10634v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["manual contact tracing","digital contact tracing","efficient contact tracing","privacy respecting contact tracing application","heart of privacy respecting contact tracing","low adoption rate of contact tracing applications","privacy friendly","individual privacy","manual approach","computation","various cryptographic techniques","studies","multiple countries","communication complexities","higher adoption rates","communication complexity expressions","rate of disease spread","India scenario","time consuming","typical client-server architecture","active participation","people\u0027s mobile devices","movements","need","collected data","key reason","mass surveillance","potential","important measure","drawbacks","large number of people","Private Set Intersection problem","early phase","accuracy","concerned governments","close social interactions","COVID","subsequent analytics","better controlled epidemic","hour","confidence","study","order","pandemic","issues","fact"],"language":"en"},

To analyze the supply shock, we classify industries as essential or non-essential and construct a Remote Labor Index, which measures the ability of different occupations to work from home. Demand shocks are based on a study of the likely effect of a severe influenza epidemic developed by the US Congressional Budget Office. Compared to the pre-COVID period, these shocks would threaten around 22% of the US economy\u0027s GDP, jeopardise 24% of jobs and reduce total wage income by 17%. At the industry level, sectors such as transport are likely to have output constrained by demand shocks, while sectors relating to manufacturing, mining and services are more likely to be constrained by supply shocks. Entertainment, restaurants and tourism face large supply and demand shocks. At the occupation level, we show that high-wage occupations are relatively immune from adverse supply and demand-side shocks, while low-wage occupations are much more vulnerable. We should emphasize that our results are only first-order shocks -- we expect them to be substantially amplified by feedback effects in the production network.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rio-Chanona, R.

Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fong, Simon James; Li, Gloria; Dey, Nilanjan; Crespo, Ruben Gonzalez; Herrera-Viedma, Enrique","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9de70a2b7ce37afe4d4a70a649341b8aaf817935.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09868v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjsyNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MC"],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["deep learning-based CMC","available data","composite data relationships","temporal-spatial data","future events","epidemic development","casual micro-data sources","possible future outcomes","deep learning network","novel coronavirus epidemic","conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques","extreme ranges of future possibilities","better fitted MC outputs","Wuhan city","better stochastic insights","Composite Monte-Carlo","medical resources","propagation","travel mobility","hospital beds","random samples","population density","nearby cities","high uncertainty","simulation","respect","forecasting method","correctness","timeliness of quarantine control","overall trend","infested cases","common practice","critical decisions","closeness","China","max rules","underlying statistical distribution","best efforts","decision makers","instance","probability distributions","terms","uniform assumptions","governments","advent","case study","paper","authorities","result","behaviour"],"language":"en"},

In particular, when individuals self-report their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals\u0027 experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days.

In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antiviral, strategies for mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of these mitigation strategies. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission in New York state and the entire US, show that the pandemic will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) in New York State and the entire US decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. This study shows that early termination of strict social-distancing could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to that projected before the onset of strict social-distance. The use of efficacious face-masks (efficacy greater than 70%) could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of other anti-COVID-19 intervention measures can lead to elimination of the pandemic. The mask coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if mask-use is combined with strict social-distancing.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ngonghala, Calistus N.; Iboi, Enahoro; Eikenberry, Steffen; Scotch, Matthew; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina; Bonds, Matthew H.; Gumel, Abba B.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9ed2c83d4226ff4c53759324071adff7f264254.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07391v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New York"],"keyphrases":["use of low efficacy masks","cloth masks","strict social-distancing measures","use of efficacious face-masks","use of face","mask-use","early termination of strict social-distancing","elimination","residents of New York state","onset of strict social-distance","efficacy greater","significant reduction of COVID","new mathematical model","baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions","novel Coronavirus pandemic","study","entire US","burden similar","devastating public health impact","improved levels","intervention measures","mitigation strategies","mask coverage","population-level impact","transmission","cumulative mortality","effective vaccine","antiviral","isolation","quarantine","contact-tracing","data relevant","worst-case scenario projections","world","wave","absence","decreases","Simulations","end","compliance"],"language":"en"},

Existing platforms can be used to multiplex a large number of samples; however, analysis of the resulting data is complex and involves separating barcoded samples and various read manipulation processes ending in final assembly. Many assembly tools were designed with larger genomes and higher fidelity polymerases in mind and do not perform well with reads derived from highly variable viral genomes. Reference-based assemblers may leave gaps in viral assemblies while de novo assemblers may struggle to assemble unique genomes. RESULTS: The IRMA (iterative refinement meta-assembler) pipeline solves the problem of viral variation by the iterative optimization of read gathering and assembly. As with all reference-based assembly, reads are included in assembly when they match consensus template sets; however, IRMA provides for on-the-fly reference editing, correction, and optional elongation without the need for additional reference selection. This increases both read depth and breadth. IRMA also focuses on quality control, error correction, indel reporting, variant calling and variant phasing. In fact, IRMA\u2019s ability to detect and phase minor variants is one of its most distinguishing features. We have built modules for influenza and ebolavirus. We demonstrate usage and provide calibration data from mixture experiments. Methods for variant calling, phasing, and error estimation/correction have been redesigned to meet the needs of viral genomic sequencing. CONCLUSION: IRMA provides a robust next-generation sequencing assembly solution that is adapted to the needs and characteristics of viral genomes. The software solves issues related to the genetic diversity of viruses while providing customized variant calling, phasing, and quality control. IRMA is freely available for non-commercial use on Linux and Mac OS X and has been parallelized for high-throughput computing.

Severity of the pandemic was not part of the definition used, but it was stated to be less than severe at the time of declaration. It was necessary, when there was still uncertainty about the overall impact of the pandemic, for vaccine production to begin to have timely availability. Countries arranged to have vaccine for their populations, and WHO attempted to secure supplies for under-resourced countries. The world had been concerned that the next pandemic might be a severe one, based on the specter of avian influenza with a case fatality of up to 80% in humans. After it was clear that the 2009 pandemic was not severe, there were accusations, especially in Europe, that countries had secured vaccine supplies mainly to benefit the manufacturers. Such charges, even when refuted, may undermine public confidence in the process which assures vaccine supply and availability of vaccine for seasonal use. Production of pandemic vaccine is conditioned on the supply of seasonal influenza vaccine; it is unrealistic to expect vaccine to be available for pandemic use when none is used for seasonal influenza. This particularly applies to poorer counties. They have traditionally not recognized that influenza is a problem, although this attitude is changing. As we go forward, we need to keep in mind the global nature of the threat of influenza. Had the 2009 pandemic been more severe, demand would have been greater and poorer counties would have had little vaccine to meet their needs. Only by taking a broad view of influenza on an annual basis can vaccine supplies be ensured for all countries of the world.","publish_time":"2011-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monto, Arnold S.; Black, Steven; Plotkin, Stanley A.; Orenstein, Walter A.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb8496716ecbdac7a40b01f6940d3d3fa2a020ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131421.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21763381/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.06.113; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11010073; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11010073","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["Production of pandemic vaccine","vaccine supplies","vaccine supply","availability of vaccine","vaccine production","little vaccine","secured vaccine","supply of seasonal influenza vaccine","pandemic use","threat of influenza","specter of avian influenza","broad view of influenza","seasonal use","swine-origin novel influenza virus","World Health Organization","poorer counties","under-resourced countries","timely availability","time of declaration","new International Health Regulations","adopted guidelines","annual basis","appearance","process","global nature","Europe","demand","case fatality","overall impact","uncertainty","mind","public confidence","accusations","problem","needs","attitude","Severity","definition","populations","manufacturers","humans","charges"],"language":"en"},

By introducing site-specific mutations into synthetic mRNAs, we have analysed the predicted structure of the HCV 229E pseudoknot and shown that besides the well-known stem structures, S1 and S2, a third stem structure, S3, is required for a high frequency of frameshifting. The requirement for an S3 stem is independent of the length of loop 2.","publish_time":"1993-12-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herold, J; Siddell, S G","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC310462/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S3 stem","pseudoknot structure","RNA polymerase gene","ORF1a","ORF1b overlap","E pseudoknot","predicted structure","coding sequence of gene","positive-strand genomic RNA","well-known stem structures","length of loop","slippery sequence","ribosomal frameshifting","high frequency of frameshifting","S2","large open reading frames","S1","HCV","synthetic mRNAs","site-specific mutations","end","UUUAAAC","human coronavirus","requirement","region","elements","nucleotides"],"language":"en"},

Specific -1 ribosomal frameshifting is responsible for the synthesis of the large protein. Expression of ins150B also involves frameshifting. The IS150 frameshifting signals operate with a remarkably high efficiency, causing about one third of the ribosomes to switch frame. All of the signals required for this process are encoded in a 83-bp segment of the element. The heptanucleotide A AAA AAG and a potential stem-loop-forming sequence mark the frameshifting site. Similar sequence elements are found in -1 frameshifting regions of bacterial and retroviral genes. A mutation within the stem-loop sequence reduces the rate of frameshifting by about 80%.

In addition, clinical trials on the efficacy of antiviral therapies in the management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have also been reviewed, in order to identify potential treatment options for COVID-19. METHOD: An extensive search was performed in Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL databases until the end of March 15, 2020. Two independent researchers performed the screening, and finally the related studies were included. RESULTS: Only one clinical trial on the efficacy of antiviral therapy in management of COVID-19 was found. The results depicted that adding Lopinavir-Ritonavir to the standard treatment regimen of patients with severe COVID-19 has no benefits. Moreover, 21 case-series and case-report studies reported the prescription of antiviral agents in COVID-19, none of which can be used to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies in confronting COVID-19. In addition, no clinical trials were found to be performed on the efficacy of antiviral agents in the management of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSION: The current evidence impede researchers from proposing an appropriate antiviral therapy against COVID-19, making the current situation a serious concern for international organizations such as World Health Organization (WHO). In the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics, organizations such as WHO should pursue more proactive actions and plan well-designed clinical trials so that their results can be used in managing future epidemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yousefifard, Mahmoud; Zali, Alireza; Mohamed Ali, Kosar; Madani Neishaboori, Arian; Zarghi, Afshin; Hosseini, Mostafa; Safari, Saeed","journal":"Arch Acad Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9fd69bd68f51ed7f40652d85681cb66a9d66ba7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156260.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7156260/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO","World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["efficacy of antiviral therapies","management of COVID","treatment of COVID","efficacy of antiviral therapy","efficacy of antiviral agents","severe COVID","confronting COVID","prescription of antiviral agents","appropriate antiviral therapy","SARS-Cov","MERS-CoV","RESULTS","well-designed clinical trials","management of SARS","current situation","current pandemic","current evidence","management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","current systematic review","future epidemics","addition","potential treatment options","case-report studies","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","international organizations","standard treatment regimen of patients","case-series","related studies","independent researchers","Web of Science","serious concern","Medline","Embase","Scopus","CENTRAL databases","Lopinavir-Ritonavir","World Health Organization","purpose","screening","proactive actions","extensive search","order","CONCLUSION","time","METHOD","BACKGROUND","benefits"],"language":"en"},

Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies. METHODS: Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available. RESULTS: Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10\u201328 days). Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US. CONCLUSIONS: Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices. Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hill, Andrew; Wang, Junzheng; Levi, Jacob; Heath, Katie; Fortunak, Joseph","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c6c4df1d158316804f7e4fedc269307af8e4f33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7213074.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7213074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["low costs","Minimum costs of production","minimum production costs","Minimum estimated costs of production","low prices","COVID","existing drugs","Current prices","promising drugs","costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients","current list prices","affordable access","vital treatment","efficacy","affordable cost","pricing data","treatment course","analysis","established methodology","help","price negotiations","good predictive accuracy","medicines","hepatitis C","range of countries","global export shipment records","mass availability","equity","Repurposing","daclatasvir","sofosbuvir","ritonavir","lopinavir","azithromycin","hydroxychloroquine","favipiravir","remdesivir","route of chemical synthesis","RESULTS","various stages of clinical trials","HIV","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","Estimations","middle-income economies","mortality","days","pirfenidone","CONCLUSIONS","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Given the current growing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world, it is imperative that businesses review their pandemic plans and be prepared in case this epidemic expands and affects more people and communities. Preparing for a potential infectious disease pandemic from influenza or a novel corona virus is an essential component of a business continuity plan, especially for businesses that provide critical healthcare and infrastructure services. Although many businesses and organisations have a pandemic plan or address pandemic preparedness in their business continuity plans, few have recently tested and updated their plans. Pandemics can not only interrupt an organisation\u0027s operations and compromise long-term viability of an enterprise, but also disrupt the provision of critical functions. Businesses that regularly test and update their pandemic plan can significantly reduce harmful impacts to the business, play a key role in protecting employees\u0027 and customers\u0027 health and safety, and limit the negative impact of a pandemic on the community and economy.","publish_time":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koonin, Lisa M","journal":"Journal of business continuity \u0026 emergency planning","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32160942/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs3MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic plans","businesses","address pandemic preparedness","potential infectious disease pandemic","business continuity plans","critical healthcare","provision of critical functions","current growing spread of coronavirus disease","influenza","essential component","novel corona virus","safety","employees\u0027","customers\u0027 health","key role","long-term viability","COVID","harmful impacts","organisations","organisation\u0027s operations","infrastructure services","negative impact","enterprise","article","practical steps","world","community","case","people","epidemic","economy","communities","Pandemics"],"language":"en"},

Genetic diversification of the Corona virus has resulted in strains that cause severe respiratory tract infections in humans via drip and animal mediation. S-proteins covering its surface, which bind to the cell receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important in shaping virus activity. The course of infection varies from mild to severe. The ability to control infection is limited because there are no drugs that fully inhibit 2019-nCoV. Interferon-alpha (5 million U twice daily by inhalation), lopinavir/ritonavir (400/100 mg twice daily orally), as well as chloroquine (500 mg twice daily orally for 10 days) and azithromycin (500 mg twice per day) cause a milder course of the disease and reduce the duration of treatment. The administration of glucocorticosteroids and research drugs (tocilizumab) is acceptable for massive infiltrative lesions in the pulmonary parenchyma causing severe lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In the system operation it is necessary to create the socalled a safety matrix that would take into account the existing threat on the one hand and all available services and resources on the other.

METHODS We collected the data of traditional Chinese medicine related to treatment plans published by the National and Provincial Health Committee and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine from the start of COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan to February 19, 2020. The frequency analysis, cluster analysis and correlation analysis were performed. RESULTS The study collected 4 national and 34 regional prevention and treatment plans, 578 items, 84 traditional Chinese formulations, 60 Chinese patent medicines, and 230 Chinese herbs. The high frequently used herbs were Liquorice, Scutellariabaicalensis, Semen armeniacaeamarae, and Gypsum. The commonly used traditional formulations included Maxing Shigan Decoction, Yin Qiao Powder, and Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction. The Chinese patent drugs included Angong Niuhuang Pill, Xuebijing Injection, and Lianhua Qingwen Capsule. The most common paired medications were Ephedra and Semen armeniacaeamarae, Fructusforsythiae and Liquorice. Two core combinations and one novel formula were discovered in the study. CONCLUSIONS Yin Qiao Powder and Huopo Xialing Decoction are the basic formulations for Weifen syndrome of COVID-19. In addition, Maxing Shigan Decoction, Liang Ge Powder, Qingwen Baidu Decoction and Da Yuan Decoction are the basic formulations for Qifen syndrome of COVID-19.

Then the nonvaccinated individuals will be infected with probability [Formula: see text]. We apply the strategy to the susceptible-infected-recovered epidemic model in a multiplex network composed by two networks, where a fraction [Formula: see text] of the nodes acts in both networks. We map this model of dynamic vaccination into bond percolation model and use the generating functions framework to predict theoretically the behavior of the relevant magnitudes of the system at the steady state. We find a perfect agreement between the solutions of the theoretical equations and the results of stochastic simulations. In addition, we find an interesting phase diagram in the plane [Formula: see text] , which is composed of an epidemic and a nonepidemic phase, separated by a critical threshold line [Formula: see text] , which depends on [Formula: see text]. As [Formula: see text] decreases, [Formula: see text] increases, i.e., as the overlap decreases, the system is more disconnected, and therefore more virulent diseases are needed to spread epidemics. Surprisingly, we find that, for all values of [Formula: see text] , a region in the diagram where the vaccination is so efficient that, regardless of the virulence of the disease, it never becomes an epidemic. We compare our strategy with random immunization and find that, using the same amount of vaccines for both scenarios, we obtain that the spread of disease is much lower in the case of dynamic vaccination when compared to random immunization. Furthermore, we also compare our strategy with targeted immunization and we find that, depending on [Formula: see text] , dynamic vaccination will perform significantly better and in some cases will stop the disease before it becomes an epidemic.","publish_time":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alvarez-Zuzek, L.

In the present study, 1734 clinical samples (903 cases) submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU VDL) for enteric disease diagnosis between October 2012 and December 2013 were tested retrospectively for PDCoV using a virus-specific real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR targeting conserved region of the membrane gene. PDCoV genome was first detected in a fecal sample collected on August 19th 2013 from Minnesota. Subsequently, PDCoV was observed in samples collected on August 20th and August 27th from Iowa and on August 29th from Illinois.

Themes related to AMR included antimicrobial use in production and companion animals, antimicrobial stewardship, novel treatment approaches and education of professionals, politicians and the general public.

Understanding epidemiological factors characterising the transmission dynamics of this disease is of fundamental importance. AIMS: This study aimed to describe key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. METHODS: We extracted data of confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from the publicly available information released by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection. We used doubly interval censored likelihood to estimate containment delay and serial interval, by fitting gamma, lognormal and Weibull distributions to respective empirical values using Bayesian framework with right truncation. A generalised linear regression model was employed to identify factors associated with containment delay. Secondary attack rate was also estimated. RESULTS: The empirical containment delay was 6.39 days; whereas after adjusting for right truncation with the best-fit Weibull distribution, it was 10.4 days (95% CrI: 7.15 to 19.81). Containment delay increased significantly over time. Local source of infection and number of doctor consultations before isolation were associated with longer containment delay. The empirical serial interval was 4.58\u20136.06 days; whereas the best-fit lognormal distribution to 26 certain-and-probable infector\u2013infectee paired data gave an estimate of 4.77 days (95% CrI: 3.47 to 6.90) with right-truncation. The secondary attack rate among close contacts was 11.7%. CONCLUSION: With a considerable containment delay and short serial interval, contact-tracing effectiveness may not be optimised to halt the transmission with rapid generations replacement. Our study highlights the transmission risk of social interaction and pivotal role of physical distancing in suppressing the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwok, Kin On; Wong, Valerie Wing Yu; Wei, Wan In; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Tang, Julian Wei-Tze","journal":"Euro Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8286ed80888165f355cf739bf3d1fefd8d69c521.json; document_parses/pdf_json/62dfd1edb97d77b668b13455af504da02db8036c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189647.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347198/; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2020.25.16.2000155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["empirical containment delay","considerable containment delay","longer containment delay","days","empirical serial interval","right truncation","short serial interval","best-fit Weibull distribution","best-fit lognormal distribution","transmission dynamics","close contacts","data of confirmed COVID","epidemiological factors","study","Secondary attack rate","estimate","CrI","key epidemiological parameters of COVID","respective empirical values","Hong Kong Centre","Weibull distributions","transmission risk of social interaction","ongoing epidemic","infectee paired data","Bayesian framework","fitting gamma","pivotal role of physical distancing","isolation","number of doctor consultations","available information","probable infector","contact-tracing effectiveness","cases","Local source of infection","disease","Health Protection","likelihood","generalised linear regression model","rapid generations replacement","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","fundamental importance","METHODS","time","SARS-CoV","China","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Despite its worldwide occurrence, little is known on the pathogenesis of HBoV infections. In addition, few systematic studies of HBoV in ARI have been conducted in Latin America. Therefore, in order to test whether active viral replication of human bocavirus is associated with respiratory diseases and to understand the clinical impact of this virus in patients with these diseases, we performed a 3-year retrospective hospital-based study of HBoV in outpatients and inpatients with symptoms of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) in Brazil. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 1015 patients with respiratory symptoms were tested for HBoV DNA by PCR. All samples positive for HBoV were tested by PCR for all other respiratory viruses, had HBoV viral loads determined by quantitative real time PCR and, when possible, were tested by RT-PCR for HBoV VP1 mRNA, as evidence of active viral replication. HBoV was detected in 4.8% of patients, with annual rates of 10.0%, 3.0% and 3.0% in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The range of respiratory symptoms was similar between HBoV-positive and HBoV-negative ARI patients. However, a higher rate of diarrhea was observed in HBoV-positive patients. High HBoV viral loads (\u003E10(8) copies/mL) and diarrhea were significantly more frequent in patients with exclusive infection by HBoV and in patients with detection of HBoV VP1 mRNA than in patients with viral co-infection, detected in 72.9% of patients with HBoV. In summary, our data demonstrated that active HBoV replication was detected in a small percentage of patients with ARI and was correlated with concurrent diarrhea and lack of other viral co-infections.","publish_time":"2011-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Proen\u00E7a-Modena, Jos\u00E9 Luiz; Gagliardi, Talita Bianca; Escremim de Paula, Fl\u00E1via; Iwamoto, Marisa Akiko; Criado, Miri\u00E3 Ferreira; Camara, Ata\u00EDde A.; Acrani, Gustavo Olszanski; Cintra, Ot\u00E1vio Augusto Leite; Cervi, Maria C\u00E9lia; de Paula Arruda, Luisa Karla; Arruda, Eurico","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64a69a98274e2d7e11e2113546c65718f4b8cbd6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3118811.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21701591/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0021083","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Nasopharyngeal"],"organizations":["Acute Respiratory Infections","PCR"],"locations":["Latin America","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["HBoV-positive patients","HBoV DNA","HBoV-negative ARI patients","active HBoV replication","pathogenesis of HBoV infections","High HBoV viral loads","systematic studies of HBoV","detection of HBoV VP1 mRNA","respiratory diseases","viral co-infections","small percentage of patients","symptoms of Acute Respiratory Infections","year retrospective hospital-based study of HBoV","respiratory viruses","range of respiratory symptoms","evidence of active viral replication","active viral replication of human bocavirus","RT-PCR","concurrent diarrhea","samples positive","quantitative real time PCR","higher rate of diarrhea","exclusive infection","inpatients","outpatients","lack","association","clinical impact","NPAs","parvovirus","data","addition","order","Brazil","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","summary","Latin America","annual rates","worldwide occurrence","copies"],"language":"en"},

During the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Republic of Korea in 2015, serious challenges emerged regarding important ethical issues, such as transparency and the protection of privacy. The development of bioethics in Korea has been influenced by individualistic perspectives applied in clinical contexts, leading to a paucity of ethical perspectives relevant to population-level phenomena such as outbreaks. Alternative theories of public health ethics include the perspectives of relational autonomy and the patient as victim and vector. Public health actions need to incorporate clear and systematic procedures founded upon ethical principles. The MERS-CoV epidemic in Korea created significant public support for more aggressive early interventions in future outbreaks. This trend makes it all the more imperative for ethical principles and procedures to be implemented in future planning and responses to outbreaks in order to promote perceptions of legitimacy and civic participation.","publish_time":"2016-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ock-Joo","journal":"J Prev Med Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/953ce6c11451011ff271b730ac3d2bdadda75830.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4750516.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26841881/; https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.16.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Korea"],"keyphrases":["ethical principles","Ethical considerations","future outbreaks","paucity of ethical perspectives relevant","important ethical issues","individualistic perspectives","Public health actions","Republic of Korea","future planning","outbreaks of infectious diseases","significant public support","perspectives of relational autonomy","MERS-CoV epidemic","Alternative theories of public health ethics","systematic procedures","aggressive early interventions","outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","population-level phenomena","serious challenges","patient","transparency","order","perceptions of legitimacy","victim","clinical contexts","responses","civic participation","protection of privacy","vector","development of bioethics","trend"],"language":"en"},

The H120 and Ma5 are the only viral strains approved by the Brazilian government as the constituent of vaccines. Despite the systematic vaccination in Brazil, IBV has not yet been controlled and diseases associated with this virus have been reported in vaccinated chickens. Here, we investigated the genetic variability of H120 and Ma5 strains present in the IBV vaccines from different Brazilian manufacturers. We performed DNA sequencing analyses of the S1 spike glycoprotein gene to investigate its genetic variability and the presence of viral subpopulations among vaccines, between batches, and also in each vaccine after a single passage was performed in chicken embryonated eggs. Our results revealed up to 13 amino acid substitutions among vaccines and some of them were localized in regions of the S1 glycoprotein that play a role in virus\u2013host interaction. Secondary nucleotide peaks identified in the chromatogram for the S1 gene sequence revealed that all original vaccines (H120 and Ma5) were composed by different subpopulations of IBV. Moreover, new viral subpopulations were also found in vaccines after a single passage in chicken embryonated eggs. These findings indicate that H120 and Ma5 viral strains used in vaccines market in Brazil can still mutate very rapidly during replication, leading to amino acid substitutions in proteins involved in the stimulation of the immune response, such as the S1 glycoprotein. Therefore, our data suggest that the genetic variability of these viral strains should be taken into consideration to ensure an effective immune response against IBV.

The prevalence of bronchiectasis is age-related and there is some geographical variation in incidence, prevalence and clinical features. Most bronchiectasis is reported to be idiopathic however post-infectious aetiologies dominate across Asia especially secondary to tuberculosis. Most focus to date has been on the study of airway bacteria, both as colonisers and causes of exacerbations. Modern molecular technologies including next generation sequencing (NGS) have become invaluable tools to identify microorganisms directly from sputum and which are difficult to culture using traditional agar based methods. These have provided important insight into our understanding of emerging pathogens in the airways of people with bronchiectasis and the geographical differences that occur. The contribution of the lung microbiome, its ethnic variation, and subsequent roles in disease progression and response to therapy across geographic regions warrant further investigation. This review summarises the known geographical differences in the aetiology, epidemiology and microbiology of bronchiectasis. Further, we highlight the opportunities offered by emerging molecular technologies such as -omics to further dissect out important ethnic differences in the prognosis and management of bronchiectasis.","publish_time":"2018-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chandrasekaran, Ravishankar; Mac Aog\u00E1in, Miche\u00E1l; Chalmers, James D.; Elborn, Stuart J.; Chotirmall, Sanjay H.","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e1e3f91f3642424e7328ee1fafc4151b7ba826c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5964678.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12890-018-0638-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788932/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of bronchiectasis","management of bronchiectasis","microbiology of bronchiectasis","geographical variation","important ethnic differences","known geographical differences","ethnic variation","emerging molecular technologies","Modern molecular technologies","disease progression","chronic infection","important insight","associated inflammation","understanding of emerging pathogens","response","therapy","subsequent roles","aetiology","generation sequencing","airways of people","Asia","NGS","incidence","omics","epidemiology","prognosis","post-infectious aetiologies","geographic regions","irreversible dilatation","invaluable tools","lung microbiome","clinical features","colonisers","traditional agar","study of airway bacteria","sputum","microorganisms","investigation","opportunities","review","date","methods","tuberculosis"],"language":"en"},

To construct the lipid raft model, the surface pressure (\u03C0)\u2013molecular area (A) and surface potential (\u0394V)\u2013A isotherms for three-component (PSM/DOPC/CHOL) systems on 0.02M Tris buffer with 0.13M NaCl (pH7.4) were primarily measured by changing their compositions. Thermodynamic and interaction parameters for binary PSM/DOPC and PSM/CHOL systems revealed that PSM interacts more strongly with CHOL than with DOPC. In addition, a morphological analysis performed with Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) and fluorescence microscopy (FM) revealed an optimal ratio of PSM/DOPC/CHOL (1/1/1, by mole) as a model of lipid rafts. Second, the interaction of GC with the ternary PSM/DOPC/CHOL monolayers was investigated on Tris buffer solutions containing different GC concentrations (1, 5, 10, 25, and 50\u03BCM). In BAM and FM images, microdomains were found to become smaller by increasing the GC concentration in the subphase, suggesting that GC regulates the size of raft domains, which provide dynamic scaffolding for numerous cellular processes. More interestingly, the distinctive GC striped regions were formed at the interface at 50\u03BCM, which shows that GC divides the ternary monolayer into pieces. This phenomenon was observed only in the presence of CHOL in the monolayer. These results suggest that CHOL plays an essential role in the interaction with GC, which results in one of the major activities associated with saponins\u0027 membrane disruption.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sakamoto, Seiichi; Nakahara, Hiromichi; Uto, Takuhiro; Shoyama, Yukihiro; Shibata, Osamu","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef85d5c1add5deeba95a6a769978030cf3ddd113.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089610.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamem.2013.01.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0005273613000102; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273613000102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23333324/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHOL","PSM/DOPC/CHOL","PSM/DOPC","PSM/CHOL","PSM","DOPC","GC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DOPC","interaction of GC","CHOL systems","ternary PSM","CHOL monolayers","presence of CHOL","binary PSM","different GC concentrations","optimal ratio of PSM","lipid raft model","distinctive GC striped regions","lipid raft biomembrane model","interaction parameters","interaction of glycyrrhizin","ternary monolayer","model of lipid rafts","BAM","\u03BCM","results","Tris buffer solutions","size of raft domains","Langmuir monolayer technique","fluorescence microscopy","surface pressure","surface potential","FM images","Brewster angle microscopy","dynamic scaffolding","N-palmitoyl","morphological analysis","molecular area","d-erythro","essential role","saponins","numerous cellular processes","microdomains","glycero","phosphocholine","isotherms","sphingosylphosphorylcholine","component","major activities","membrane disruption","interface","\u0394V","dioleoyl-sn","NaCl","cholesterol","subphase","pieces","addition","pH7","phenomenon","compositions"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We reviewed the risk of vertical transmission of COVID-19 to the fetus of infected mothers by using data of published articles or official websites up to March 4, 2020. Results: A total of 31 infected pregnant mothers with COVID-19 were reported. No COVID-19 infection was detected in their neonates or placentas. Two mothers died from COVID-19-related respiratory complications after delivery. Conclusions: Currently, based on limited data, there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 from infected pregnant women to their fetuses.

Morbidity and mortality can be considerable on a farm with huge economic consequences for the farmer as well as compromised welfare for the mink kits. Although efforts have been taken to identify etiologic agents involved in outbreaks, the syndrome is still regarded as multifactorial and recurring problems on the same farms draw attention to management and environmental risk factors. In the pre-weaning period from May to June 2015, a case control study was carried out on 30 Danish mink farms. Data concerning management, biosecurity, hygiene, feed consumption, antibacterial prescription and production efficiency were analyzed. RESULTS: The proportion of 1-year old females, farm size (total number of females), energy supply per female in the late gestation period, and dogs accessing the farm area were significantly associated with being a case farm. Case farms were prescribed almost twice the amount of antibacterials per gestational unit (female and litter) as in control farms. Farmers on case farms spent significantly more time nursing and treating the animals and experienced more females with mastitis compared to farmers on control farms. No significant differences in cleaning practices or hygienic measures between case and control farms were found and there were no differences in drinking water quality, bedding material, composition neither of color types nor in management regarding litter equalization. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study showed an association between the occurrence of pre-weaning diarrhea on mink farms and parity profile, farm size and feeding intensity in the gestational period. The access of dogs to the farm area was a significant risk factor, but needs further clarification.

Modelling studies have aided understanding of COVID-19 dynamics from the first announcement of the epidemic and publication of the genetic sequence of the causative virus. Initial phylogenetic analysis of closely related viruses suggested highly linked person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 originating from mid-November to early December, 2019.1, 2 Following this, modellers provided simple calculations that identified a mismatch between reported cases in China and reported importations of cases from travellers. Based on travel volumes, modellers inferred3 that cases in Wuhan were underestimated by a factor of 40\u2014a crucially important finding. Further calculations, again based on travel volumes, suggested that some countries would be expected to have many more travel-related cases than had been notified,4 drawing attention to the possibility of undetected cases and community transmission in several countries. \u2022 View related content for this article Transmission dynamic models are a necessary first step in understanding the pandemic potential of an emerging infectious disease, including estimating the reproduction number\u2014the number of new cases arising from a typical infected case.

The study recommends education of community members about the potential risks involved in human-bat interactions and makes suggestions for reducing the frequent interactions with and exposure to bats by humans.","publish_time":"2017-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ayivor, Jesse S.; Ohemeng, Fidelia; Tweneboah Lawson, Elaine; Waldman, Linda; Leach, Melissa; Ntiamoa-Baidu, Yaa","journal":"J Environ Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22d9a77f7eb015a61ad58babdd9a9a68c29a3176.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5610796.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29081813/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/5938934","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ghana"],"keyphrases":["bats","humans","study","human activities","human-bat interactions","potential risks of disease transmission","township of Ve Golokuati","perspective of residents","frequent interactions","participatory appraisal approach","participatory landscape mapping","Transmission of zoonotic pathogens","reported cases of disease spillover","focus group discussions","fruit trees","children\u0027s outdoor recreation","indirect contact","domestic chores","public apprehension","questionnaire administration","Epomophorus gambianus roost","camps","respondents","medical records","suggestions","education of community members","ecosystems services","petty-trading","exposed people","Ghana","exposure","walk","Data","fevers"],"language":"en"},

Recent evidence suggests that an upregulation of ACE2 can be stimulated by all\u2010trans retinoic acid (at\u2010RA); however, at\u2010RA also affects regulation of the stem\u2010cell marker octomer\u20104 (Oct\u20104) and thus cellular differentiation. We have previously shown that smooth muscle cells and macrophages present within rabbit atherosclerotic plaques are positive for ACE2, Oct\u20104 and the haematopoietic stem\u2010cell marker CD34. Thus, to provide evidence that possible at\u2010RA treatment could affect both plaque cellular biology (via effects on cellular differentiation) and blood pressure (via ACE2), it is vital to show that cells with atherosclerotic plaques co\u2010express all three markers. Thus, we sought to provide evidence that a subset of cells within atherosclerotic plaques is positive for ACE2, Oct\u20104 and CD34. We used New Zealand White rabbits that were fed a control diet supplemented with 0.5% cholesterol plus 1% methionine for 4 weeks and then allowed to consume a normal diet for 10 weeks. Immunohistochemistry was performed by standard techniques. We report that ACE2, Oct\u20104 and CD34 were all present within atherosclerotic plaques. Although macrophages were positive for all three markers, spindle\u2010shaped cells in the media did not show all three markers. The endothelium overlying normal arterial wall showed positive Oct\u20104 and ACE2 immunoreactivity, but CD34 immunoreactivity was patchy, indicating that such cells might not have fully differentiated. It is concluded that cells in atherosclerotic plaques express co\u2010express ACE2, Oct\u20104 and CD34. Further studies aimed at establishing the effects of all\u2010trans retinoic acid on blood pressure and atherosclerotic cell differentiation are warranted.","publish_time":"2008-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zulli, Anthony; Rai, Sudarshan; Buxton, Brian F.; Burrell, Louise M.; Hare, David L.","journal":"Exp Physiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f73bef0a6c90b24091a1c6fc027838deb8a07c14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197899.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1113/expphysiol.2007.040204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18192339/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 immunoreactivity","upregulation of ACE2","atherosclerotic plaques co\u2010","co\u2010express ACE2","rabbit atherosclerotic plaques","atherosclerotic cell differentiation","shaped cells","subset of cells","CD34 immunoreactivity","cell marker CD34","cellular differentiation","markers","smooth muscle cells","RA treatment","treatment of blood pressure disorders","effects of all\u2010trans retinoic acid","macrophages present","cell marker octomer","normal diet","Recent evidence","weeks","plaque cellular biology","possible implications","haematopoietic stem","novel enzyme","control diet","normal arterial wall","spindle","endothelium","media","New Zealand White rabbits","cholesterol","Immunohistochemistry","standard techniques","methionine","Angiotensin","studies"],"language":"en"},

Objective We aimed to compare characteristics, complications, and outcomes between severe RV- and influenza virus (IFV)-associated pneumonia in adults. Study design We used prospective cohort data of adult patients with severe pneumonia who had been admitted to the medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital over a 4-year period. The clinical features and outcomes of 27 patients with RV-positive bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were compared to those of 51 pneumonia patients with IFV-positive BAL fluid or IFV-positive nasopharyngeal specimens. Results Of 356 patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL and respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RV was the most commonly identified virus (8.1%) from BAL fluid. Patients with RV-associated pneumonia were more likely to be immunocompromised than patients with IFV-associated pneumonia (81.5% vs. 33.3%, p \u003C0.001). Bacterial coinfection tended to be less common in the RV group (18.5% vs. 37.3%, p =0.09). Although septic shock was less common in the RV group (29.6% vs. 54.9%, p =0.03), other clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and radiologic patterns were similar between the groups. The 28-day mortality of patients with severe RV- and IFV-associated pneumonia was similarly high (29.6% vs. 35.3% respectively, p =0.61). Conclusions Severe RV-associated pneumonia patients were more likely to be immunocompromised and less likely to present septic shock. Overall clinical features were similar and mortalities of both groups were comparably high. Studies of larger cohorts encompassing mild to moderate pneumonia patients are needed.","publish_time":"2015-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Sang-Ho; Huh, Jin Won; Hong, Sang-Bum; Lee, Ju Young; Kim, Sung-Han; Sung, Heungsup; Do, Kyung-Hyun; Lee, Sang-Oh; Kim, Mi-Na; Jeong, Jin-Yong; Lim, Chae-Man; Kim, Yang Soo; Woo, Jun Hee; Koh, Younsuck","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ed037050f9d1d900c65209bcc0587d10f980fe5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106464.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.11.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542469/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214004181; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214004181","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFV-associated pneumonia","severe pneumonia","moderate pneumonia patients","Conclusions Severe RV-associated pneumonia patients","characteristics of RV","RV group","IFV-positive BAL fluid","day mortality of patients","RV-positive bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage","bronchoscopic BAL","prospective cohort data of adult patients","IFV-positive nasopharyngeal specimens","clinical features","influenza virus","identified virus","outcomes","clinical manifestations","groups","septic shock","respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction","tertiary care hospital","medical intensive care unit","PCR","radiologic patterns","laboratory findings","mortalities","Studies of larger cohorts","Study design","RVs","complications","Abstract Background Rhinoviruses","adults","year period","Bacterial coinfection","Results","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has provided a new platform for an easily adaptable molecular technique for molecular diagnosis of malaria without the use of expensive instruments. A new primer set has been designed targeting the 18S rRNA gene for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum in whole blood samples. The efficacy of LAMP using the new primer set was assessed in this study in comparison to that of a previously described set of LAMP primers as well as with microscopy and real-time PCR as reference methods for detecting P. falciparum. Pre-addition of hydroxy napthol blue (HNB) in the LAMP reaction caused a distinct color change, thereby improving the visual detection system. The new LAMP assay was found to be 99.1% sensitive compared to microscopy and 98.1% when compared to real-time PCR. Meanwhile, its specificity was 99% and 100% in contrast to microscopy and real-time PCR, respectively. Moreover, the LAMP method was in very good agreement with microscopy and real-time PCR (0.94 and 0.98, respectively). This new LAMP method can detect at least 5parasites/\u03BCL of infected blood within 35min, while the other LAMP method tested in this study, could detect a minimum of 100parasites/\u03BCL of human blood after 60min of amplification. Thus, the new method is sensitive and specific, can be carried out in a very short time, and can substitute PCR in healthcare clinics and standard laboratories.","publish_time":"2014-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohon, Abu Naser; Elahi, Rubayet; Khan, Wasif A.; Haque, Rashidul; Sullivan, David J.; Alam, Mohammad Shafiul","journal":"Acta Tropica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3145e4dfa286d7b07d64bc569a7be0e09448d6b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117200.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X1400062X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2014.02.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001706X1400062X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24613155/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new LAMP method","new LAMP assay","new method","LAMP reaction","efficacy of LAMP","real-time PCR","microscopy","new primer set","new platform","described set of LAMP primers","Abstract Molecular diagnosis of malaria","nucleotide amplification","parasites","isothermal amplification","\u03BCL of human blood","blood samples","\u03BCL of infected blood","study","sensitive","adaptable molecular technique","detection of Plasmodium falciparum","use of expensive instruments","standard laboratories","well-established laboratories","visual detection system","HNB","good agreement","Pre-addition of hydroxy napthol blue","distinct color change","reference methods","S rRNA gene","healthcare clinics","minimum","Loop","contrast","comparison","short time","specificity"],"language":"en"},

The urgent need for guidance and the paucity of structured scientific data on emerging diseases hinder the formulation of evidence-informed recommendations using standard methods and procedures. OBJECTIVES: In the context of the response to recent public health emergencies, this project aimed to describe the information products produced by WHO and assess the quality and trustworthiness of a subset of these products classified as guidelines. METHODS: We selected four recent infectious disease emergencies: outbreaks of avian influenza A\u2014H1N1 virus (2009) and H7N9 virus (2013), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2013), and Ebola virus disease (EVD) (2014 to 2016). We analyzed the development and publication processes and evaluated the quality of emergency guidelines using AGREE-II. RESULTS: We included 175 information products of which 87 were guidelines. These products demonstrated variable adherence to WHO publication requirements including the listing of external contributors, management of declarations of interest, and entry into WHO\u2019s public database of publications. For guidelines, the methods for development were incompletely reported; WHO\u2019s quality assurance process was rarely used; systematic or other evidence reviews were infrequently referenced; external peer review was not performed; and they scored poorly with AGREE II, particularly for rigour of development and editorial independence. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that WHO guidelines produced in the context of a public health emergency can be improved upon, helping to assure the trustworthiness and utility of WHO information products in future emergencies.","publish_time":"2018-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Norris, Susan L.; Sawin, Veronica Ivey; Ferri, Mauricio; Raques Sastre, Laura; Porgo, Teegwend\u00E9 V.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/944f574a3d37e76e4d5a5d23c870733622b02dc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5976182.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29847593/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WHO","World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["information products","quality of emergency guidelines","recent public health emergencies","public health emergency","production of high-quality guidelines","future emergencies","recent infectious disease emergencies","response","World Health Organization","H1N1 virus","H7N9 virus","Ebola virus disease","public database of publications","context","standard methods","trustworthiness","rigour of development","quality assurance process","formulation of evidence","publication requirements","evidence reviews","publication processes","listing of external contributors","external peer review","challenges","outbreaks of avian influenza","emerging diseases","paucity of structured scientific data","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","informed recommendations","project","guidance","MERS-CoV","management of declarations","procedures","entry","variable adherence","utility","subset","urgent need","editorial independence","BACKGROUND","EVD","study","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","OBJECTIVES"],"language":"en"},

This virus causes an economically and, possibly, environmentally, important loss in the poultry industry. Therefore, research into the avian coronavirus in various species of birds is required. The Eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) is an endemic bird to Indonesia and Northern Australia and often kept as pets. At present, there has been limited information about avian coronavirus infection among birds. This study aimed to determine the presence of and to characterize avian coronavirus isolated from Eclectus parrots in Indonesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cloacal swab samples were taken from 10 healthy Eclectus parrots (E. roratus). Each isolate was propagated into specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. The presence of avian coronavirus was determined using three sets of primers targeting the 3\u2019 untranslated region (3\u2019-UTR) of avian coronavirus (UTR41\u002B/11\u2212), the N gene of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBVN\u002B/\u2212), and the S1 gene of the IBV (XCE2\u002B/XCE2\u2212). The infectious bronchitis vaccine strain H120 was used as a positive control. Resulting positive bands were sequenced for the S1 gene. RESULTS: None of the isolates was positive for the 3\u2019-UTR, four isolates were positive for the N gene of infectious bronchitis, and two isolates were positive for the S1 gene of the IBV. However, only one isolate (parrot/Indonesia/BX9/16) was sequenced for the partial S1 gene with primers XCE2\u002B/XCE2\u2212. The partial nucleotide sequence of this isolate showed 100% homology with the IBV GI-13 lineage, specifically with a field isolate of the 4/91 variant 1 Israel and the 4/91 vaccine on the hypervariable region 3 site of the S1 gene. CONCLUSION: An IB-like avian coronavirus was isolated from healthy Eclectus parrots.

L. infantum). A vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) would be an important tool for decreasing the anxiety related to possible L. chagasi infection and for controlling human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Because the sand fly salivary proteins are potent immunogens obligatorily co-deposited during transmission of Leishmania parasites, their inclusion in an anti-Leishmania vaccine has been investigated in past decades. We investigated the immunogenicity of the \u201CLbSapSal\u201D vaccine (L. braziliensis antigens, saponin as adjuvant, and Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland extract) in dogs at baseline (T(0)), during the post-vaccination protocol (T(3rd)) and after early (T(90)) and late (T(885)) times following L. chagasi-challenge. Our major data indicated that immunization with \u201CLbSapSal\u201D is able to induce biomarkers characterized by enhanced amounts of type I (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03B1, interleukin [IL]-12, interferon [IFN]-\u03B3) cytokines and reduction in type II cytokines (IL-4 and TGF-\u03B2), even after experimental challenge. The establishment of a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response after \u201CLbSapSal\u201D immunization supported the increased levels of nitric oxide production, favoring a reduction in spleen parasitism (78.9%) and indicating long-lasting protection against L. chagasi infection. In conclusion, these results confirmed the hypothesis that the \u201CLbSapSal\u201D vaccination is a potential tool to control the Leishmania chagasi infection.","publish_time":"2016-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Resende, Lucilene Aparecida; Aguiar-Soares, Rodrigo Dian de Oliveira; Gama-Ker, Henrique; Roatt, Bruno Mendes; de Mendon\u00E7a, Ludmila Zanandreis; Alves, Marina Luiza Rodrigues; da Silveira-Lemos, Denise; Corr\u00EAa-Oliveira, Rodrigo; Martins-Filho, Olindo Assis; Ara\u00FAjo, M\u00E1rcio Sobreira Silva; Fujiwara, Ricardo Toshio; Gontijo, Nelder Figueiredo; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa; Giunchetti, Rodolfo Cordeiro","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60f0773c8eeace01dd0364c5c63febbfe9dd3a62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4996460.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27556586/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161169","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LbSapSal","Leishmania chagasi infection","chagasi-challenge","anti-Leishmania vaccine","immunization","reduction","cytokines","Dogs","important tool","transmission of Leishmania parasites","human visceral leishmaniasis","canine visceral leishmaniasis","salivary proteins","potential tool","experimental challenge","enhanced amounts of type","important domestic reservoir of","post-vaccination protocol","Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland extract","adjuvant","potent immunogens","saponin","prominent pro-inflammatory immune response","inclusion","CVL","increased levels of nitric oxide production","tumor necrosis factor","TNF","biomarkers","braziliensis antigens","anxiety","establishment","sand","hypothesis","baseline","TGF-\u03B2","interferon","interleukin","IFN","long-lasting protection","times","spleen parasitism","major data","past decades","conclusion","results","immunogenicity","infantum"],"language":"en"},

Methods All confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Wenzhou from January 19 to February 20, 2020, were collected and analyzed. Of the 116 patients with COVID-19, 27 were diagnosed as severe cases. Among severe cases, 9 were treated in ICU. The data of blood routine examination were analyzed and compared among common patients (as common group), severe patients admitted to intensive care unit (as severe ICU group) and severe patients not admitted to ICU (as severe non-ICU group). The blood routine examination results were dynamically observed in the above groups after admission. Results Patients with COVID-19 have lower counts of leucocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, platelets, and hemoglobin, but have higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), which were compared with controls (P \u003C 0.001). In severe ICU group, patients have the lowest count of lymphocytes, but the highest neutrophil count and NLR among the above three groups (all P values \u003C 0.05); NLR and MLR indicators were combined for diagnostic efficacy analysis of severe COVID-19, and its area under the curve reached 0.925. The odds ratio of the delay in days to the start of the increase of eosinophil count for predicting the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19 was 2.291 after age adjusted. Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 have abnormal peripheral blood routine examination results. Dynamic surveillance of peripheral blood system especially eosinophils is helpful in the prediction of severe COVID-19 cases.","publish_time":"2020-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Suyu; Cai, Xuejiao; Wang, Huaguo; He, Guiqing; Lin, Yin; Lu, Bibi; Chen, Chaoyue; Pan, Yong; Hu, Xingzhong","journal":"Clinica Chimica Acta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62f359f316ae797bbadbb49afa587ae8f57e327e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194694.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120301790; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120301790; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339487/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["China","Wenzhou"],"keyphrases":["severe patients","severe cases","severe ICU group","prediction of severe COVID","Results Patients","severe non-ICU group","common patients","outcome of patients","Conclusions Patients","diagnostic efficacy analysis of severe COVID","NLR","common group","data of blood routine examination","abnormal peripheral blood routine examination results","eosinophils","lowest count of lymphocytes","highest neutrophil count","monocyte-lymphocyte ratio","higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio","odds ratio","groups","Dynamic surveillance of peripheral blood system","increase of eosinophil count","MLR indicators","P values","intensive care unit","days","start","lower counts of leucocytes","delay","hemoglobin","platelets","coronavirus disease","Abstract Background","area","Methods","Wenzhou","Wuhan","China","curve","admission","controls","age","world"],"language":"en"},

Consecutive patients attending an emergency department during two study periods (February/March 2009 and 2010) were enrolled using broad inclusion criteria (fever/preceding fever and one of a set of ICD\u20109 codes suggestive of respiratory illness); nasopharyngeal washes were tested for the most common respiratory viruses using PCR\u2010based methods. Influenza A virus was detected in 24% of samples collected in February/March 2009, whereas no samples tested positive for influenza during February/March 2010 (pandemic H1N1 Influenza A having circulated earlier in October\u2013December 2009). Rhinovirus (HRV) was detected in 16% and 8% of patients recruited over the two study periods, respectively. Other respiratory viruses were detected rarely. Patient data were then analyzed with specific PCR results, comparing the HRV\u2010positive group with virus\u2010positive and no virus\u2010detected groups. Individuals over 65 years old with HRV presented with signs, symptoms and underlying conditions and were admitted to hospital as often as the other enrolled patients, mainly for dyspnoea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute exacerbation. Conversely, younger individuals with HRV, although presenting with respiratory signs and symptoms, were generally diagnosed with non\u2010respiratory conditions. HRV was detected frequently in elderly patients attending the emergency department for respiratory distress without distinguishing clinical features. Molecular diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and surveillance of infectious diseases should include tests for HRV, as this virus is associated frequently with hospitalization of the elderly.

Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence, risk factors and herpes zoster outcomes in this population. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study of herpes zoster infections in dermatomyositis/polymyositis patients was performed. The patients were followed at a tertiary center from 1991 to 2012. For the control group, each patient with herpes zoster was paired with two patients without herpes zoster. Patients were matched by gender and the type of myositis, age at myositis onset and disease duration. RESULTS: Of 230 patients, 24 (10.4%) had a histories of herpes zoster (19 with dermatomyositis and five with polymyositis, two-thirds female). The mean age of the patients with herpes zoster was 44.6\u00B116.8 years. No difference between the groups was found regarding cumulative clinical manifestations. Disease activity, autoantibody, muscle and leukogram parameters were also comparable between the groups. No differences in immunosuppressive (alone or in association with other immunosuppressive therapies) or glucocorticoid (current use, medium dose and cumulative dose in the last two months) therapies were found between patients with and without herpes zoster. However, a higher proportion of patients in the herpes zoster group received chloroquine diphosphate compared to the control group. All of the patients received acyclovir; 58.3% of patients had postherpetic neuralgia and no cases of recurrence were reported. Furthermore, individuals who were taking high prednisone doses at the time of the herpes zoster diagnosis had reduced levels of postherpetic neuralgia. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that chloroquine diphosphate could predispose patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis to developing herpes zoster, particularly women and dermatomyositis patients.","publish_time":"2013-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"da Cunha, Gilmara Franco; de Souza, Fernando Henrique Carlos; Levy-Neto, Maur\u00EDcio; Shinjo, Samuel Katsuyuki","journal":"Clinics (Sao Paulo)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ff89400f9bff213ae066c12daa59d5a40fa6257.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3654292.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23778404/; https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2013(05)07","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dermatomyositis patients","herpes zoster group","polymyositis patients","herpes zoster diagnosis","herpes zoster outcomes","histories of herpes zoster","higher proportion of patients","retrospective cohort study of herpes zoster infections","control group","cumulative dose","chloroquine diphosphate","immunosuppressive therapies","groups","levels of postherpetic neuralgia","medium dose","myositis onset","type of myositis","mean age","Disease activity","disease duration","cumulative clinical manifestations","current use","muscle","glucocorticoid","time","context of different systemic autoimmune diseases","leukogram parameters","autoantibody","risk factors","high prednisone doses","prevalence","months","women","cases of recurrence","individuals","METHOD","data","association","gender","population","CONCLUSIONS","thirds female","tertiary center","OBJECTIVES","years","acyclovir","differences","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that following implementation of a molecular multiplex respiratory viral panel (RVP), AECOPD patients with viral infections would be more easily identified, limiting antibiotic use in this population. The primary objective of our study was to investigate if availability of the RVP decreased antibiotic prescription at discharge among patients with AECOPD. METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective, before (pre-RVP) - after (post-RVP) study of patients admitted to a tertiary medical center from January 2013 to March 2016. The primary outcome was antibiotic prescription at discharge. Groups were compared using univariable and multivariable logistic-regression. RESULTS: A total of 232 patient-episodes were identified, 133 following RVP introduction. Mean age was 68.1 (pre-RVP) and 68.3 (post-RVP) years respectively (p = 0.88). Patients in pre-RVP group were similar to the post-RVP group with respect to gender (p = 0.54), proportion of patients with BMI \u003C 21(p = 0.23), positive smoking status (p = 0.19) and diagnoses of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, p = 0.16). We found a significant reduction in antibiotic prescription rate at discharge in patients admitted with AECOPD after introduction of the respiratory viral assay (pre-RVP 77.8% vs. post-RVP 63.2%, p = 0.01). In adjusted analyses, patients in the pre-RVP group [OR 2.11 (CI: 1.13\u20133.96), p = 0.019] with positive gram stain in sputum [OR 4.02 (CI: 1.61\u201310.06), p = 0.003] had the highest odds of antibiotic prescription at discharge.

Recently, investigators have stipulated that COVID-19 patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be subject to poorer outcomes. This editorial presents the available evidence to guide treatment practices during this pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies from Wuhan cohorts provide valuable information about COVID-19. A cohort with 52 critically ill patients revealed cardiac injury in 12% of patients. Worse outcomes appear to be more prevalent in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), possibly due to overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway alveolar epithelial cells. Investigators suspect that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter the lungs in a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV. Several hypotheses have been proposed to date regarding the net effect of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 infections. Positive effects include ACE2 receptor blockade, disabling viral entry into the heart and lungs, and an overall decrease in inflammation secondary to ACEI/ARB. Negative effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism, by which ACE2 receptors are upregulated. SUMMARY: Even though physiological models of SARS-CoV infection show a theoretical benefit of ACEI/ARB, these findings cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. Major cardiology scientific associations, including ACC, HFSA, AHA, and ESC Hypertension Council, have rejected these correlation hypotheses. After an extensive literature review, we conclude that there is no significant evidence to support an association for now, but given the rapid evolvement of this pandemic, findings may change.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rico-Mesa, Juan Simon; White, Averi; Anderson, Allen S.","journal":"Curr Cardiol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/207999abec39f4c58270be58e3e8f160f05c72de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7154066.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32291526/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-020-01291-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACEI/ARB","ACC","ESC Hypertension Council"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","COVID","CoV infection","ARB","pandemic","ACE2 receptor blockade","ACE2 receptors","RECENT FINDINGS","ill patients","physiological models of SARS","theoretical benefit of ACEI","lungs","net effect of ACEI","investigators","Recent studies","mechanism similar","Negative effects","Positive effects","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","enzyme inhibitors","available evidence","overexpression of angiotensin","significant evidence","poorer outcomes","Worse outcomes","correlation hypotheses","aggressive coronavirus disease","ESC Hypertension Council","extensive literature review","possible retrograde feedback mechanism","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Wuhan cohorts","viral entry","valuable information","overall decrease","ACC","HFSA","inflammation secondary","airway alveolar epithelial cells","Major cardiology scientific associations","virus responsible","heart","treatment practices","date","cardiac injury","diabetes mellitus","rapid evolvement","SUMMARY","editorial","infections"],"language":"en"},

The role of hMPV in causing respiratory tract infections in Kuwait was not yet investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hMPV infection in Kuwait among patients with respiratory tract infection with respect to other respiratory viruses. During January\u2013December 2009, 460 respiratory samples from 388 patients with respiratory tract infection were collected from different hospitals. They were tested for hMPV RNA by real\u2010time PCR, and for other respiratory viruses by conventional PCR. Out of 388 patients, 110 (28%) were positive for viral respiratory infections; 21 (5.4%) were positive for hMPV, 29 (7.5%) were positive for rhinovirus, 13 (4%) were positive for respiratory syncytial virus, and 10 (3%) were positive for adenovirus. Most (n = 19, 90.5%) of hMPV\u2010positive patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, 76% of them were of age 2 years and below, and 24% of age 59 years and above. All hMPV\u2010positive elderly patients had pneumonia while 50% of hMPV\u2010positive infants had bronchopneumonia. Children with hMPV/rhinovirus co\u2010infection (n = 3, 1%) had recurrent chest infection and frequent intensive care unit admission. The hMPV infection was mostly detected between December and May, and genotype B was more prevalent than genotype A. This is the first study demonstrating the prevalence of hMPV infection in Kuwait, and suggests that hMPV infection is prevalent in infants and elderly patients with lower respiratory tract infection.

We predict that this might change in the future as government and industry respond to the twin threats of the global spread of infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism.","publish_time":"2006-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reichert, Janice M.","journal":"Trends in Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d9e891da1d47e911424f3679f3d0ff18b1911f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119034.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779906001260; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167779906001260","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Tufts Center","Study of Drug Development","USA","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["approval of new therapeutics","new vaccines","efficient development","new protein therapeutics","efficiency of drug development","Study of Drug Development","approval phases","past decade","oncology products","global spread of infectious diseases","various legislative acts","data","twin threats","FDA initiatives","potential bioterrorism","industry","health","trends","USA","Opinion article","Tufts Center","government","welfare of patients","lack of incentives","future","results","years"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among students and employees of two higher education institutions in Lahore, Pakistan, namely the University of Lahore and the Gulab Devi Educational Complex. Participants were recruited using a convenient sampling method. A validated 45-item, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Total possible scores were 0\u201314 for knowledge (scores \u003C 7, 7\u201310 and \u003E 10 were considered to indicate poor, moderate and good knowledge, respectively); 0\u20137 for attitude (scores \u003E 5 were considered to indicate a good attitude); and 0\u201318 for COVID-19 preventative practices (scores \u003E 12 were considered to indicate good preventative practices). RESULTS: Of the 417 enrolled participants, 416 reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source of their information. Mean scores were 10.12 \u00B1 2.20 for knowledge (good, moderate and poor knowledge in 50.2%, 42.8% and 7.0% of participants, respectively); 5.74 \u00B1 1.28 for attitude (65.4% of individuals had a positive attitude); and 11.04 \u00B1 3.34 for COVID-19 preventative practices (only 36.5% of participants had good preventive practices). CONCLUSION: Pakistani university students and employees have good knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19, but unsatisfactory preventive practices.

Abstract Objectives To clarify the procedures related to mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit setting: allocation of ventilators, team education, maintenance and reference documents. Study design Declarative survey. Methods Between September and December 2010, we assessed the assignment and types of ventilators (ICU ventilators, temporary repair ventilators, non-invasive ventilators [NIV], and transportation ventilators), medical and nurse education, maintenance of the ventilators, presence of reference documents. Results are expressed in median/range and proportions. Results Among the 62 participating ICUs, a median of 15 ventilators/ICU (range 1\u221250) was reported with more than one trademark in 47 (76%) units. Specific ventilators were used for NIV in 22 (35%) units, temporary repair in 49 (79%) and transportation in all the units. Nurse education courses were given by ICU physicians in 54 (87%) units or by a company in 29 (47%) units. Medical education courses were made by ICU senior physicians in 55 (89%) units or by a company in 21 (34%) units. These courses were organized occasionally in 24 (39%) ICU and bi-annually in 16 (26%) units. Maintenance procedures were made by the ICU staff in 39 (63%) units, dedicated staff (17 [27%]) or bioengineering technicians (14 [23%] ICU). Reference documents were written for maintenance procedures in 48 (77%) units, ventilator setup in 22 (35%) units and ventilator dysfunction in 20 (32%) ICU. Conclusions This first survey shows disparate distribution of ventilators and practices among French ICU. Education and understanding of the proper use of ventilators are key issues for security improvement.","publish_time":"2013-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Montravers, P.; Ichai, C.; Dupont, H.; Payen, J.

Antiviral substances obtained from medicinal plants are potentially good targets to study. Glycyrrhiza uralensis and G. glabra have been commonly used in both traditional and modern medicine. In this study, extracts of G. uralensis roots and their components were examined for anti\u2010HCV activity using an HCV cell culture system. It was found that a methanol extract of G. uralensis roots and its chloroform fraction possess anti\u2010HCV activity with 50%\u2010inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of 20.0 and 8.0 \u03BCg/mL, respectively. Through bioactivity\u2010guided purification and structural analysis, glycycoumarin, glycyrin, glycyrol and liquiritigenin were isolated and identified as anti\u2010HCV compounds, their IC(50) being 8.8, 7.2, 4.6 and 16.4 \u03BCg/mL, respectively. However, glycyrrhizin, the major constituent of G. uralensis, and its monoammonium salt, showed only marginal anti\u2010HCV activity. It was also found that licochalcone A and glabridin, known to be exclusive constituents of G. inflata and G. glabra, respectively, did have anti\u2010HCV activity, their IC(50) being 2.5 and 6.2 \u03BCg/mL, respectively. Another chalcone, isoliquiritigenin, also showed anti\u2010HCV activity, with an IC(50) of 3.7 \u03BCg/mL. Time\u2010of\u2010addition analysis revealed that all Glycyrrhiza\u2010derived anti\u2010HCV compounds tested in this study act at the post\u2010entry step. In conclusion, the present results suggest that glycycoumarin, glycyrin, glycyrol and liquiritigenin isolated from G. uralensis, as well as isoliquiritigenin, licochalcone A and glabridin, would be good candidates for seed compounds to develop antivirals against HCV.","publish_time":"2014-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adianti, Myrna; Aoki, Chie; Komoto, Mari; Deng, Lin; Shoji, Ikuo; Wahyuni, Tutik Sri; Lusida, Maria Inge; Soetjipto,; Fuchino, Hiroyuki; Kawahara, Nobuo; Hotta, Hak","journal":"Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86be84a9d729f45ed7f50f248a1e4a3cf262cb6a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168410.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1348-0421.12127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397541/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Glycyrrhiza"],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["marginal anti\u2010HCV activity","derived anti\u2010HCV compounds","\u03BCg","uralensis roots","Glycyrrhiza uralensis","HCV cell culture system","glycycoumarin","glycyrin","seed compounds","study act","glycyrol","glabridin","isoliquiritigenin","glabra","licochalcone","structural analysis","addition analysis","good candidates","good targets","treatment of hepatitis C virus","alternative drugs","chloroform fraction","medicinal plants","guided purification","infection","components","monoammonium salt","bioactivity","post\u2010entry step","present results","antivirals","exclusive constituents of","inhibitory concentrations","economic points of view","Antiviral substances","inflata","major constituent of","methanol extract of","extracts of","Development of complementary","modern medicine","glycyrrhizin","conclusion","Time"],"language":"en"},

In this study, virus replication and PRRSV-specific antibody were followed for several hundred days in a group of pigs derived from three sows infected at 90 days of gestation with PRRSV isolate VR-2332. Eighty-four percent of pigs were born viremic with a mortality of 54% within 21 days after birth. At approximately 60 days sera from pigs were negative for virus by virus isolation. Analysis of virus replication in the tissues of pigs randomly sacrificed between 63 and 132 days showed no evidence of virus in lung and other non-lymphoid organs. However, virus was easily recovered from tonsil and lymph nodes and in situ hybridization identified these tissues as sites of virus replication. Even though replication was at a low level, virus was easily transmitted to sentinel pigs. By 260 days pigs became seronegative and did not transmit virus to sentinel pigs.

These emerging diseases present a very unique challenge to public health officials and infectious disease specialists. Perhaps they have been with us for millions of years, lurking in a dark corner of the environment, waiting for an opportunity to jump from their natural cycle of transmission to a human host. Or they may represent something totally new. Regardless of their origin, an emerging disease pathogen must be characterized quickly by molecular biologists and microbiologists. The dynamics of disease transmission must be investigated by teams of epidemiologists. Treatment regimens must be formulated by clinicians working on the frontlines of the outbreak. Disease prevention strategies and risk communications must be quickly formulated by public health officials. Finally, media attention for emerging disease outbreaks forces government officials at all levels to address the problem with planning and preparedness activities aimed at preserving the health of the public. Specific examples explored in this chapter include Nipah virus, hantavirus, West Nile fever virus, and the coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ryan, Jeffrey R.","journal":"Biosecurity and Bioterrorism","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/610415460ce719ad07065b0fd2298a6aef504125.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150296.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128020296000050; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128020296000050","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["emerging disease pathogen","public health officials","dynamics of disease transmission","emerging diseases","emerging disease outbreaks forces government officials","infectious disease specialists","Disease prevention strategies","chapter","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Nipah virus","natural cycle of transmission","Category C diseases","West Nile fever virus","hantavirus","coronaviruses","unique challenge","levels","media attention","risk communications","problem","planning","preparedness activities","agents","human host","clinicians","dark corner","environment","opportunity","origin","molecular biologists","Specific examples","frontlines","Treatment regimens","microbiologists","millions of years","teams of epidemiologists"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: IgM and IgG antibody levels were assessed via chemiluminescence immunoassay in 338 COVID\u201019 patients. RESULTS: IgM levels increased during the first week after SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, peaked 2 weeks and then reduced to near\u2010background levels in most patients. IgG was detectable after 1 week and was maintained at a high level for a long period. The positive rates of IgM and/or IgG antibody detections were not significantly different among the mild, severe and critical disease groups. Severe and critical cases had higher IgM levels than mild cases, whereas the IgG level in critical cases was lower than those in both mild and severe cases. This might be because of the high disease activity and/or a compromised immune response in critical cases. The IgM antibody levels were slightly higher in deceased patients than recovered patients, but IgG levels in these groups did not significantly differ. A longitudinal detection of antibodies revealed that IgM levels decreased rapidly in recovered patients, whereas in deceased cases, either IgM levels remained high or both IgM and IgG were undetectable during the disease course.

Results showed an excess of variants correlated with virus diversity in genes involved in immune response and in the biosynthesis of glycan structures functioning as viral receptors; a significantly higher than expected number of variants was also seen in genes encoding proteins that directly interact with viral components. Genome-wide analyses identified 441 variants significantly associated with virus-diversity; these are more frequently located within gene regions than expected, and they map to 139 human genes. Analysis of functional relationships among genes subjected to virus-driven selective pressure identified a complex network enriched in viral products-interacting proteins.

Medical records and thoracic radiographs of dyspneic companion rats presented to the University of California at Davis, William R. Pritchard Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital during the time period from January 2000 to December 2014 were reviewed. Rats with postmortem confirmation of thoracic lesions were included in the study. Thoracic radiographs were evaluated for positioning, lesion distribution, lung lobe involved, pulmonary pattern, mediastinal and pleural lesions by three observers blinded to diagnosis. Thirty rats were included in the study, including 23 rats with an infectious disease and seven with neoplasia. Mediastinal lesions were significantly more prevalent in the group diagnosed with thoracic neoplasia (P = 0.031), in particular cranially (P = 0.048). Although there was an overlap between the two groups, findings indicated that the presence of cranial mediastinal lesions may be helpful for differentiating neoplastic from infectious disease in rats.","publish_time":"2016-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fouriez\u2010Labl\u00E9e, Virginie; Vergneau\u2010Grosset, Claire; Kass, Philip H.; Zwingenberger, Allison L.","journal":"Vet Radiol Ultrasound","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13537359dcdc3540b6709ad8dc2960033e5fd2e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169294.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/vru.12459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27922210/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["William R.

Immune thrombocytopenia can be secondary to medications or to a concurrent disease, such as an autoimmune condition (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [APS], immune thyroid disease, or Evans syndrome), a lymphoproliferative disease (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or large granular T-lymphocyte lymphocytic leukemia), or chronic infection, eg, with Helicobacter pylori, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Response to infection may generate antibodies that cross-react with platelet antigens (HIV, H pylori) or immune complexes that bind to platelet Fc\u03B3 receptors (HCV) and platelet production may be impaired by infection of megakaryocyte bone marrow-dependent progenitor cells (HCV and HIV), decreased production of thrombopoietin (TPO), and splenic sequestration of platelets secondary to portal hypertension (HCV). Sudden and severe onset of thrombocytopenia has been observed in children after vaccination for measles, mumps, and rubella or natural viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and varicella zoster virus.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused more than half of the deaths due to cirrhosis in the region, followed by alcohol consumption (20\u00B78%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; 12\u00B71%), and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; 15\u00B77%). In 2015, HBV accounted for about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the region. Preventive strategies for viral hepatitis-related liver disease include increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation. HBV vaccination programmes for neonates have been implemented by all countries, although birth-dose coverage is extremely suboptimal in some. Availability of screening tests for blood and tissue, donor recall policies, and harm reduction strategies are in their initial stages in most countries. Many governments have put HBV and HCV drugs on their essential medicines lists and the availability of generic versions of these drugs has reduced costs. Efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat, together with the rapid increase in per-capita alcohol consumption in countries and the epidemic of obesity, are expected to change the spectrum of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region in the near future. The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be contained through government policies to limit consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use, which are in place in some countries but need to be enforced more strictly. Steps are needed to control obesity and NAFLD, including policies to promote healthy lifestyles and regulate the food industry. Inadequate infrastructure and insufficient health-care personnel trained in liver diseases are issues that also need to be addressed in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy response of most governments to liver diseases has thus far been inadequate and poorly funded. There must be a renewed focus on prevention, early detection, timely referral, and research into the best means to introduce and improve health interventions to reduce the burden of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region.","publish_time":"2019-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarin, Shiv K; Kumar, Manoj; Eslam, Mohammed; George, Jacob; Al Mahtab, Mamun; Akbar, Sheikh M Fazle; Jia, Jidong; Tian, Qiuju; Aggarwal, Rakesh; Muljono, David H; Omata, Masao; Ooka, Yoshihiko; Han, Kwang-Hyub; Lee, Hye Won; Jafri, Wasim; Butt, Amna S; Chong, Chern H; Lim, Seng G; Pwu, Raoh-Fang; Chen, Ding-Shinn","journal":"Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b673fa91f60456c9d71db17037452fd8eb57d0fd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9d1fc6c858dfe028aef86221cf3567f8824c2f0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164809.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s2468-1253(19)30342-5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468125319303425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31852635/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468125319303425","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBV","NAFLD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["burden of liver diseases","related liver diseases","spectrum of liver diseases","Asia-Pacific region","global deaths","viral hepatitis-related liver disease","countries","global burden of acute viral hepatitis","non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","increasing burden of alcohol","global population","half","hepatitis C virus","capita alcohol consumption","Chronic hepatitis B virus","health interventions","HCV drugs","chronic infection","government policies","NAFLD","governments","HBV vaccination programmes","cirrhosis","harmful patterns of alcohol use","public health threat","cases of hepatocellular carcinoma","increasing access","insufficient health-care personnel","Preventive strategies","Inadequate infrastructure","epidemic of obesity","harm reduction strategies","Availability of screening tests","availability of generic versions","early detection","prevention","donor","blood","clean drinking water","timely referral","research","tissue","rapid increase","essential medicines","healthy lifestyles","initial stages","renewed focus","sanitation","best means","birth-dose coverage","neonates","home","policy response","near future","food industry","thirds","place","issues","costs","Efforts","Steps"],"language":"en"},

Here, we asked whether naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4, that alter amino acid residues required for MERS-CoV S binding, influence cellular entry of MERS-CoV. By screening of public databases, we identified fourteen such polymorphisms. Introduction of the respective mutations into DPP4 revealed that all except one (\u0394346-348) were compatible with robust DPP4 expression. Four polymorphisms (K267E, K267N, A291P and \u0394346-348) strongly reduced binding of MERS-CoV S to DPP4 and S protein-driven host cell entry, as determined using soluble S protein and S protein bearing rhabdoviral vectors, respectively. Two polymorphisms (K267E and A291P) were analyzed in the context of authentic MERS-CoV and were found to attenuate viral replication.

A major reason is the lack of genetic tools for studying PEDV. In this review, we discuss the reverse genetics approaches that have been successfully used to engineer infectious clones of PEDV as well as other potential and complementary methods that have yet to be applied to PEDV. The importance of proper cell culture for successful PEDV propagation and maintenance of disease phenotype are addressed in our survey of permissive cell lines. We also highlight areas of particular relevance to PEDV pathogenesis and disease that have benefited from reverse genetics studies and pressing questions that await resolution by such studies. In particular, we examine the spike protein as a determinant of viral tropism, entry and virulence, ORF3 and its association with cell culture adaptation, and the nucleocapsid protein and its potential role in modulating PEDV pathogenicity.

The aims of the study were to determine the duration of viral RNA carriage and the infectivity of viral particles on fomites and human nasal mucosa after exposure to BCoV and BRSV. During two animal infection experiments, swabs were collected from personnel (nasal mucosa) and their clothes, boots and equipment after contact with calves shedding either virus. Viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR or droplet digital RT-PCR (RT-ddPCR), and selected samples with high levels of viral RNA were tested by cell culture for infectivity. RESULTS: For BCoV, 46% (n = 80) of the swabs from human nasal mucosa collected 30 min after exposure were positive by RT-qPCR. After two, four and six hours, 15%, 5% and 0% of the swabs were positive, respectively. Infective virions were not detected in mucosal swabs (n = 2). A high viral RNA load was detected on 97% (n = 44) of the fomites 24 h after exposure, and infective virions were detected in two of three swabs. For BRSV, 35% (n = 26) of the human nasal mucosa swabs collected 30 min after exposure, were positive by RT-ddPCR, but none were positive for infective virions. Of the fomites, 89% (n = 38) were positive for BRSV RNA 24 h after exposure, but all were negative for infective viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that human nasal mucosa can carry both BCoV and BRSV RNA after exposure to virus shedding calves, but the carriage seems short-lived and the transmission potential is likely limited. High viral loads on contaminates fomites 24 h after exposure to infected animals, and detection of infective BCoV, indicate that contaminated fomites represent a significant risk for indirect transmission between herds.","publish_time":"2018-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oma, Veslem\u00F8y Sunniva; Klem, Thea; Tr\u00E5v\u00E9n, Madeleine; Alenius, Stefan; Gjerset, Britt; Myrmel, Mette; Stokstad, Maria","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2baa5a272429873854470fa3f3cec0c91264f5d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5778652.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29357935/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1335-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV","RNA","Infective","BRSV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exposure","BRSV RNA","human nasal mucosa swabs","high levels of viral RNA","high viral RNA load","Infective virions","duration of viral RNA carriage","detection of infective BCoV","RT-qPCR","RT-ddPCR","contaminated fomites","mucosal swabs","High viral loads","infectivity of viral particles","infective viruses","droplet digital RT-PCR","transmission potential","knowledge of indirect transmission","herds","personnel","calves","RESULTS","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","endemic pathogens bovine coronavirus","spread","significant risk","selected samples","infected animals","boots","clothes","cell culture","animal infection experiments","order","equipment","study","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","aims","hours"],"language":"en"},

The presence of VPgPro in either wheat germ extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems lead to inhibition of translation. The inhibition did not appear to be mediated by the interaction of VPg with the eIF(iso)4E translation initiation factor since a VPg mutant that does not interact with eIF(iso)4E still inhibited translation. Monitoring the fate of RNAs revealed that they were degraded as a result of addition of TuMV VPgPro or of Norwalk virus (NV) VPg protein. The RNA degradation was not the result of translation being arrested and was heat labile and partially EDTA sensitive.

The physiological relevance of G1 to S phase transition was established when viral gene expressions as well as viral titers were found to be increased in S phase synchronized cells and decreased in G0/G1 phase synchronized cells compared to unsynchronized cells during rotavirus infection.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhowmick, Rahul; Banik, George; Chanda, Shampa; Chattopadhyay, Shiladitya; Chawla-Sarkar, Mamta","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b780e945c3c4877be6c8448889fe3344800dde5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111987.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.03.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268221400083X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268221400083X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725954/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S phase transition","S phase synchronized cells","G1 phase synchronized cells","rotavirus induced S phase accumulation","effect of rotavirus infection","host cell cycle","unsynchronized cells","MA104 cells","expression of calmodulin","inducer of G1","cell cycle machinery","cell cycle manipulation","expression of cyclins","physiological relevance of G1","host cellular functions","expression of CDK inhibitors","Calmodulin pathway dependent","cellular parasites","viral titers","viral gene expressions","cyclin dependent kinases","G0","activation of CaMKI","induction","RV","Abstract Viruses","study","benefit"],"language":"en"},

Only the S protein was able to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes, indicating that this viral protein is the major hemagglutinin of HCV-OC43. The receptor determinant recognized by this virus on the surface of erythrocytes is N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) which is also used by bovine coronavirus for attachment to cells. By analyzing erythrocytes containing different amounts of Neu5,9Ac2 in either of two linkage types, it was found that there are subtle differences in the affinity of both viruses for 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. Bovine coronavirus was more efficient in recognizing low amounts of Neu5,9Ac2 \u03B22,3 linked to galactose, whereas HCV-OC43 was superior with respect to the \u03B22,6 linkage. The gene coding for the S protein of HCV-OC43 was cloned and sequenced. A large open reading frame predicts a polypeptide of 150 kDa in the unglycosylated form. A protein of about 190 kDa is expected if the 20 potential glycosylation sites are used for attachment of N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. These predictions were confirmed by in vitro transcription and translation of the gene in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. A high degree of sequence homology was found between the S proteins of HCV-OC43 and bovine coronavirus. Structural and functional analyses of more strains should help to identify the location of the sialic acid-binding site.","publish_time":"1993-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"K\u00FCnkel, Frank; Herrler, Georg","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682283713607; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682283713607","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV-OC43","S protein of HCV","human coronavirus OC43","bovine coronavirus","S proteins of HCV","viral protein","9Ac2 \u03B22","surface of erythrocytes","major hemagglutinin of HCV","surface glycoproteins S","low amounts of Neu5","attachment of N","different amounts of Neu5","chicken erythrocytes","O-acetylneuraminic acid","O-acetylated sialic acid","kDa","sialic acid-binding site","N-acetyl","gene coding","linked oligosaccharide","viral membrane","linkage types","polypeptide","presence","absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes","respect","large open reading frame","strains","viruses","location","high degree of sequence homology","galactose","potential glycosylation sites","affinity","functional analyses","transcription","translation","chains","cells","subtle differences","unglycosylated form","receptor determinant","predictions"],"language":"en"},

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between medical masks and cloth masks. SETTING: 14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam. PARTICIPANTS: 1607 hospital HCWs aged \u226518 years working full-time in selected high-risk wards. INTERVENTION: Hospital wards were randomised to: medical masks, cloth masks or a control group (usual practice, which included mask wearing). Participants used the mask on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection. RESULTS: The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.

Activation of autophagy by viruses can provide an innate defense against infection, and for (\u002B) strand RNA viruses autophagosomes can facilitate assembly of replicase proteins. We demonstrated that nonstructural protein (NSP) 6 of the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), generates autophagosomes from the ER. A statistical analysis of MAP1LC3B puncta showed that NSP6 induced greater numbers of autophagosomes per cell compared with starvation, but the autophagosomes induced by NSP6 had smaller diameters compared with starvation controls. Small diameter autophagosomes were also induced by infection of cells with IBV, and by NSP6 proteins of MHV and SARS and NSP5, NSP6, and NSP7 of arterivirus PRRSV. Analysis of WIPI2 puncta induced by NSP6 suggests that NSP6 limits autophagosome diameter at the point of omegasome formation. IBV NSP6 also limited autophagosome and omegasome expansion in response to starvation and Torin1 and could therefore limit the size of autophagosomes induced following inhibition of MTOR signaling, as well as those induced independently by the NSP6 protein itself. MAP1LC3B-puncta induced by NSP6 contained SQSTM1, which suggests they can incorporate autophagy cargos. However, NSP6 inhibited the autophagosome/lysosome expansion normally seen following starvation. Taken together the results show that coronavirus NSP6 proteins limit autophagosome expansion, whether they are induced directly by the NSP6 protein, or indirectly by starvation or chemical inhibition of MTOR signaling. This may favor coronavirus infection by compromising the ability of autophagosomes to deliver viral components to lysosomes for degradation.","publish_time":"2014-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cottam, Eleanor M; Whelband, Matthew C; Wileman, Thomas","journal":"Autophagy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e2387a88720584e25e0f6418be2491523e288af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4203519.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4161/auto.29309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24991833/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV NSP6","NSP6 proteins of MHV","NSP6 limits autophagosome diameter","coronavirus NSP6 proteins limit autophagosome expansion","ability of autophagosomes","size of autophagosomes","following starvation","Small diameter autophagosomes","starvation controls","greater numbers of autophagosomes","strand RNA viruses autophagosomes","coronavirus infection","omegasome expansion","long-lived proteins","MAP1LC3B-puncta","lysosome expansion","assembly of replicase proteins","avian coronavirus","cellular response","lysosomes","Analysis of WIPI2 puncta","statistical analysis of MAP1LC3B puncta","following inhibition of MTOR","degradation","infection of cells","Activation of autophagy","autophagy cargos","nonstructural protein","chemical inhibition of MTOR","cellular organelles","point of omegasome formation","infectious bronchitis virus","viral components","NSP5","SARS","smaller diameters","Torin1","results","innate defense","NSP7 of arterivirus PRRSV","SQSTM1"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about how feeding regime can affect behavioural and physiological responses, which have the potential to impact on calf health and well-being. Traditional methods of assessing calf health and welfare such as behavioural observations and blood sampling can be time consuming and impractical for producers and invasive for animals involved. Developments in technology have increased the availability of on-farm non-invasive devices which allow automatic and remote collection of behavioural and physiological data linked to animal health and welfare. This study aimed to use devices to measure lying behaviour, heart rate, heart rate variability and infrared temperature of calves offered high or low levels of milk replacer and different types of forage throughout the first ten weeks of life. Calves displayed changes in lying behaviour and heart rate variability as a result of changes in milk replacer feeding frequency. Additionally, infrared temperature changes were detected during periods of vaccination which corresponded with a rise in core body temperature. Results have highlighted that these sensors can provide important and useable data regarding overall calf well-being on commercial farms. ABSTRACT: This study aimed to examine the use of non-invasive monitoring technologies as a means of capturing behavioural, physiological and health responses of calves allocated to different nutritional regimes. Seventy-four Holstein Friesian calves were individually penned and allocated to receive either high (HML) or conventional (CML) milk replacer (MR) levels between 5\u201370 days of age. Additionally calves were allocated to one of four forage treatments: (i) chopped straw offered between 14\u201370 days of age (CS14), (ii) chopped straw offered between 56\u201370 days of age (CS56), (iii) grass silage offered between 56\u201370 days of age (GS56), and (iv) no forage in the pre-wean period (NF). A representative sample of calves from each treatment were fitted with activity sensors and heart rate monitors throughout the experimental period to examine lying behaviour and heart rate variability, respectively. Thermal images of the eye and rectal area of each calf were taken 5 days/week between 5\u201377 days of age. Faecal and respiratory scoring of each individual calf was carried out on a daily basis throughout the experimental period. Milk replacer feeding level had limited effects on measures of calf health, although HML calves tended to have an increased likelihood for receiving treatment for scour than CML calves. Daily lying time (min/d) was lower in HML calves following reduction in MR feeding frequency at 43 days of age and weaning at 71 days of age when compared with CML calves. Additionally, HML calves displayed a lower heart rate variability following weaning, this suggestive of increased stress load. There were limited effects of forage treatment, however, CS14 calves displayed a greater daily lying time following MR step-down at 68 days of age, this potentially indicating increased rumination. Results of the present study highlight the benefits of using remote monitoring technologies as a means of detecting behavioural and physiological changes as a result of nutritional management strategy in individually housed dairy calves.","publish_time":"2019-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scoley, Gillian; Gordon, Alan; Morrison, Steven","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/522970c3ab7dfd56f03358b19739d66ce7219097.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6827363.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6827363/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":["CML","HML"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HML calves","CML calves","days of age","CS14 calves","health responses of calves","infrared temperature of calves","representative sample of calves","Holstein Friesian calves","lower heart rate variability","future performance of dairy calves","heart rate monitors","physiological changes","effects of milk","measures of calf health","forage feeding regimes","individual calf","limited effects of forage treatment","physiological data","behavioural observations","result of changes","physiological responses","low levels of milk replacer","overall calf well-being","infrared temperature changes","animal health","forage treatments","greater daily lying time following MR step-down","remote collection of behavioural","different types of forage","experimental period","increased likelihood","increased rumination","means","time consuming","remote monitoring technologies","different nutritional regimes","welfare","use of non-invasive monitoring technologies","frequency","daily basis","weeks of life","weaning","present study","Results","straw","suggestive of increased stress load","farm non-invasive devices","core body temperature","useable data","result of nutritional management strategy","activity sensors","blood sampling","producers","availability","eye","benefits","scour","reduction","rectal area","Recent research","commercial farms","rise","respiratory scoring","potential","Thermal images","periods of vaccination","Traditional methods","SIMPLE SUMMARY","animals","CS56","Developments","technology","grass silage","GS56","ABSTRACT"],"language":"en"},

Blood samples were screened using the ELISAs, and confirmed using the Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) and toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST). RESULTS: Among 394 792 blood donors, 733 tested TPPA and TRUST positive (active infection), and 728 tested only TPPA positive (historical infection). The overall prevalence of syphilis seropositivity was 370.1 per 100 000 (95% CI 351.1 to 389.0 per 100 000); the prevalence of active infection was 185.7 per 100 000 (95% CI 172.2 to 199.1 per 100 000). People aged \u226545 years displayed a prevalence of 621.8 per 100 000 in syphilis seropositivity and 280.5 per 100 000 in active infection, which were 3.8 times and 2.4 times higher than that for people aged \u003C25 years, respectively. The prevalence of syphilis seropositivity (\u03C7(2) (trend)=311.9, p (trend)\u003C0.001) and active infection (\u03C7(2) (trend)=72.1, p (trend)\u003C0.001) increased significantly with age. After stratification by gender and year of donation, the increasing trend of prevalence with age remained (p (trend)\u003C0.05), except for the prevalence of active infection in males and females in 2014.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve dogs diagnosed with canine atopic dermatitis (CAD) were intramuscularly treated with 0.5\u00D710(6) of cryopreserved ASCs from a healthy immunized young canine Ehrlichia canis free donor weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by the pruritus index and the CAD Lesion Index (CADLI) test. Safety and adverse effects were determined by injection site reaction, weight, blood chemistry, liver function, and whole blood count. RESULTS: Canine ASCs obtained from a donor met the minimum qualities required for this type of cells and showed viability of 90% after thawing. The efficacy of the CADLI score and the pruritus index in 12 dogs with atopic dermatitis was statistically significant efficacy. No adverse reactions were observed at the intramuscular application site, or in relation to animal weight, blood cell populations, or liver and renal function. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that intramuscular administration of cryopreserved ASCs to dogs with atopic dermatitis is a promising cellular therapeutic product for the relief of the symptoms of this disease; however, the duration of the effects obtained with this dose and with other doses should be evaluated, as well as possible immune reactions. As far as we know, this is the first report of the use of multiple intramuscular doses cryopreserved ASCs to treat atopic dermatitis.","publish_time":"2019-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Enciso, Nathaly; Amiel, Jos\u00E9; Pando, John; Enciso, Javier","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f61c2dbfa5417548e87ffd4da8286b37f9479b09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6925044.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2019.1747-1754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32025111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAD Lesion"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Canine ASCs","canine atopic dermatitis","intramuscular administration of cryopreserved ASCs","dogs","healthy canine donor","use of multiple intramuscular doses cryopreserved ASCs","pruritus index","Treatment efficacy","intramuscular application site","intramuscular treatment protocol of multidose","blood chemistry","CAD Lesion Index","liver function","blood count","adverse effects","significant efficacy","RESULTS","adverse reactions","AIM","healthy immunized young canine Ehrlichia canis free donor weekly","blood cell populations","animal weight","renal function","type of cells","safety performance","CADLI score","injection site reaction","possible immune reactions","promising cellular therapeutic product","allogeneic adipose stem cells","relation","relief","weeks","test","minimum qualities","pilot study","expanded ex","disease","symptoms","report","METHODS","duration","viability","MATERIALS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The expression of viral proteins is frequently subject to translational control. The dominant target of such control is the initiation step of protein synthesis. Indeed, during the early stages of infection, viral mRNAs must compete with their host counterparts for the protein synthetic machinery, especially for the limited pool of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) that mediate the recruitment of ribosomes to both viral and cellular mRNAs. To circumvent this competition viruses use diverse strategies so that ribosomes can be recruited selectively to viral mRNAs. In this review we focus on the initiation of protein synthesis and outline some of the strategies used by viruses to ensure efficient translation initiation of their mRNAs.

This study examined the environmental occurrence of gene markers for livestock-related bacterial, protozoan, and viral pathogens and antibiotic resistance in surface waters within the South Fork Iowa River basin before and after periods of swine manure application on agricultural land. Increased concentrations of indicator bacteria after manure application exceeding Iowa\u0027s state bacteria water quality standards suggest that swine manure contributes to diminished water quality and may pose a risk to human health. Additionally, the occurrence of HEV and numerous bacterial pathogen genes for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus in both manure samples and in corresponding surface water following periods of manure application suggests a potential role for swine in the spreading of zoonotic pathogens to the surrounding environment. During this study, several zoonotic pathogens were detected including Shiga-toxin producing E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni, pathogenic enterococci, and S. aureus; all of which can pose mild to serious health risks to swine, humans, and other wildlife. This research provides the foundational understanding required for future assessment of the risk to environmental health from livestock-related zoonotic pathogen exposures in this region.

However, because endogenous bovine immunoglobulin light chain loci are still intact, the light chains are produced both from the hIGK and hIGL genomic loci on the HAC and from the endogenous bovine kappa-chain (bIGK) and lambda-chain (bIGL) genomic loci, resulting in the production of fully hIgGs (both Ig heavy-chains and light-chains are of human origin: hIgG/hIg\u03BA or hIgG/hIg\u03BB) and chimeric hIgGs (Ig heavy-chains are of human origin while the Ig light-chains are of bovine origin: hIgG/bIg\u03BA or hIgG/bIg\u03BB).

It serves as a barrier in many cases to protect other components of the body from such substances and infections. Fortunately, the gastrointestinal tract is remarkably robust and generally is able to withstand multiple daily assaults by the chemicals to which it is exposed. Some chemicals, however, can affect one or more aspects of the gastrointestinal tract to produce abnormal events that reflect toxicity. It is the purpose of this chapter to evaluate the mechanisms by which toxic chemicals produce their deleterious effects and to determine the consequences of the toxicity on integrity of gastrointestinal structure and function. Probably because of the intrinsic ability of the gastrointestinal tract to resist toxic chemicals, there is a paucity of data regarding gastrointestinal toxicology. It is therefore necessary in many cases to extrapolate toxic mechanisms from infectious processes, inflammatory conditions, ischemia, and other insults in addition to more conventional chemical sources of toxicity.","publish_time":"2017-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gelberg, H.","journal":"Comprehensive Toxicology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/531aaaae80af0cf9c787e1a11a65731fe8623bdb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173509.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128012383109237; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128012383109237","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["toxic chemicals","gastrointestinal tract","gastrointestinal toxicology","toxic mechanisms","toxic substances","large amounts of chemicals","integrity of gastrointestinal structure","cases","conventional chemical sources of toxicity","contaminants","drugs","nutrients","infectious processes","incidental food additives","ischemia","inflammatory conditions","addition","insults","great variety","consequences","multiple daily assaults","inhaled particles","deleterious effects","paucity of data","abnormal events","body","components","function","intrinsic ability","Humans","chapter","infections","aspects","purpose","barrier"],"language":"en"},

AVARDA provides a probabilistic assessment of infection at species-level resolution by considering alignment of all library peptides to each other and to all human viruses. We employed AVARDA to analyze VirScan data from a cohort of encephalitis patients with either known viral infections or undiagnosed etiologies. By comparing acute and convalescent sera, AVARDA successfully confirmed or detected antibody responses to human herpesviruses 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, thereby improving the rate of diagnosing viral encephalitis in this cohort by 62.5%. We further assessed AVARDA\u2019s utility in the setting of an epidemiological study, demonstrating its ability to determine infections acquired in a child followed prospectively from infancy. We consider ways in which AVARDA\u2019s conceptual framework may be further developed in the future and describe how its analyses may be extended beyond investigations of viral infection.

Aim To describe an hPIV-3 nosocomial outbreak and the results of environmental sampling to elucidate the source of nosocomial transmission and the role of environmental contamination. Methods During an hPIV-3 outbreak between May and June 2016, environmental surfaces in contact with clustered patients were swabbed and respiratory specimens used from infected patients and epidemiologically unlinked controls. The epidemiologic relatedness of hPIV-3 strains was investigated by sequencing of the haemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase and fusion protein genes. Findings Of 19 hPIV-3-infected patients, eight were haematopoietic stem cell recipients and one was a healthcare worker. In addition, four had upper and 12 had lower respiratory tract infections. Of the 19 patients, six (32%) were community-onset infections (symptom onset within \u003C7 days of hospitalization) and 13 (68%) were hospital-onset infections (\u22657 days of hospitalization). Phylogenetic analysis identified two major clusters: five patients, and three patients plus one healthcare worker. Therefore, seven (37%) were classified as nosocomial transmissions. hPIV-3 was detected in 21 (43%) of 49 environmental swabs up to 12 days after negative respiratory polymerase chain reaction conversion. Conclusion At least one-third of a peak season nosocomial hPIV-3 outbreak originated from nosocomial transmission, with multiple importations of hPIV-3 from the community, providing experimental evidence for extensive environmental hPIV-3 contamination.

We show that TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6 signaling is a key disease pathway that controls the severity of ALI. The oxidized phospholipid (OxPL) OxPAPC was identified to induce lung injury and cytokine production by lung macrophages via TLR4-TRIF. We observed OxPL production in the lungs of humans and animals infected with SARS, Anthrax, or H5N1. Pulmonary challenge with an inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus rapidly induces ALI and OxPL formation in mice. Loss of TLR4 or TRIF expression protects mice from H5N1-induced ALI. Moreover, deletion of ncf1, which controls ROS production, improves the severity of H5N1-mediated ALI.

There are important roles for higher quality district hospital care within these systems. These hospitals are also sources of information of considerable importance to health systems, but this role, as with the wider roles of district hospitals, has been neglected. KEY MESSAGES: As we make efforts to develop higher quality health systems in LMIC we highlight the critical importance of district hospitals focusing here on how data on hospital mortality offers value: i) in understanding disease burden; ii) as part of surveillance and impact monitoring; iii) as an entry point to exploring system failures; and iv) as a lens to examine variability in health system performance and possibly as a measure of health system quality in its own right. However, attention needs paying to improving data quality by addressing reporting gaps and cause of death reporting. Ideally enabling the collection of basic, standardised patient level data might support at least simple case-mix and case-severity adjustment helping us understand variation. Better mortality data could support impact evaluation, benchmarking, exploration of links between health system inputs and outcomes and critical scrutiny of geographic variation in quality and outcomes of care. Improved hospital information is a neglected but broadly valuable public good. CONCLUSION: Accurate, complete and timely hospital mortality reporting is a key attribute of a functioning health system. It can support countries\u2019 efforts to transition to higher quality health systems in LMIC enabling national and local advocacy, accountability and action.","publish_time":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"English, Mike; Mwaniki, Paul; Julius, Thomas; Chepkirui, Mercy; Gathara, David; Ouma, Paul O.; Cherutich, Peter; Okiro, Emelda A.; Snow, Robert W.","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61472699f26e3bedce001d84f6e4791ac50652f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5833062.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29495961/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-018-1024-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LMIC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["higher quality health systems","data quality","measure of health system quality","health system inputs","health system performance","functioning health system","higher quality district hospital care","strength of primary health care systems","LMIC","system failures","timely hospital mortality reporting","Better mortality data","outcomes of care","critical importance of district hospitals","Improved hospital information","wider roles of district hospitals","reporting gaps","standardised patient level data","cause of death reporting","critical scrutiny of geographic variation","key attribute","impact evaluation","important roles","simple case","sources of information","considerable importance","countries\u2019 efforts","KEY MESSAGES","impact monitoring","case-severity adjustment","exploration of links","benchmarking","local advocacy","middle-income countries","value","collection of basic","accountability","focus","variability","entry point","action","CONCLUSION","attention needs","lens","understanding disease burden","right","surveillance","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Analysis of these new species is important for research into animal models of hepatitis C virus infection and into the zoonotic origins of human viruses. Here, we provide the first systematic phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of these two genera at the whole-genome level. Phylogenies confirmed that hepatitis C virus is most closely related to viruses from horses whereas human pegiviruses clustered with viruses from African primates. Within each genus, several well-supported lineages were identified and viral diversity was structured by both host species and location of sampling. Recombination analyses provided evidence of interspecific recombination in hepaciviruses, but none in the pegiviruses. Putative mosaic genome structures were identified in NS5B gene region and were supported by multiple tests. The identification of interspecific recombination in the hepaciviruses represents an important evolutionary event that could be clarified by future sampling of novel viruses. We also identified parallel amino acid changes shared by distantly related lineages that infect similar types of host. Notable parallel changes were clustered in the NS3 and NS4B genes and provide a useful starting point for experimental studies of the evolution of Hepacivirus host\u2013virus interactions.","publish_time":"2015-10-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Th\u00E9z\u00E9, Julien; Lowes, Sophia; Parker, Joe; Pybus, Oliver G.","journal":"Genome Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d10ef49bd91ac16d18f53f428f4ef3acc96469a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5635594.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26494702/; https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evv202","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hepaciviruses","discovery of viruses","human pegiviruses","virus interactions","zoonotic origins of human viruses","host species","related lineages","future sampling of novel viruses","animal models of hepatitis C virus infection","evidence of interspecific recombination","Recombination analyses","identification of interspecific recombination","evolutionary analysis","evolution of Hepacivirus host","similar types of host","important evolutionary event","well-supported lineages","Notable parallel changes","viral diversity","new species","parallel amino acid changes","African primates","genome level","location of sampling","known genetic diversity","Putative mosaic genome structures","research","bats","experimental studies","useful starting point","NS5B gene region","equines","bovines","NS4B genes","NS3","genera","recent years","horses","genus","Phylogenies","multiple tests","rodents"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to investigate associations between upper respiratory infection (URI) in pregnancy and measures of cognitive and behavioral outcomes in child offspring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A longitudinal study of 534 mother-child pairs with information regarding prenatal exposures collected through an interview conducted on average one year after delivery and subsequent participation in a childhood cognitive and psychosocial assessment between the ages 5\u201312 years. Childhood cognition was measured using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and the Beery-Buktenica Test of Visual Motor Integration-Fifth Edition (VMI-5) and behavioral function measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and teacher-report using the Teacher Report Form (TRF). Adjusted mean differences (adjMD) in outcome measures were calculated between mothers reporting the presence or absence of a URI during pregnancy. RESULTS: URI during pregnancy was not associated with the two measures of cognition given to offspring, but was associated with modest increases in total behavioral problems reported by mothers (adjMD: 3.72; CI: 1.91\u20135.54) and teachers (adjMD: 2.74; CI: 0.97\u20134.50). We observed differences in CBCL and TRF scores based on timing of URI: infections in mid-pregnancy (lunar months 4\u20135) were associated with poorer scores than were infections in early pregnancy (lunar months 2\u20133). CONCLUSIONS: In general, URI in pregnancy was not associated with decrements in childhood cognition, but may be associated with behavior problems.","publish_time":"2016-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parker, Samantha E.; Lijewski, Virginia A.; Janulewicz, Patricia A.; Collett, Brent R.; Speltz, Matthew L.; Werler, Martha M.","journal":"Neurotoxicol Teratol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a5d0b7a5e7e4c694c4ce1d334a9d67918f5caf2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5056812.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892036216300630; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ntt.2016.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27343815/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0892036216300630","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Teacher Report Form","URI","TRF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early pregnancy","mid-pregnancy","timing of URI","child offspring","adjMD","measures of cognition","Childhood cognition","measures of cognitive","childhood cognitive","infections","behavioral function","teacher-report","behavioral outcomes","Child Behavior Checklist","total behavioral problems","mothers","CBCL","TRF scores","outcome measures","lunar months","behavior problems","mother-child pairs","Teacher Report Form","longitudinal study","Maternal infection","poorer scores","mean differences","upper respiratory infection","Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test","Beery-Buktenica Test of Visual Motor Integration","subsequent participation","PPVT","delivery","prenatal exposures","information","VMI","associations","psychosocial assessment","modest increases","interview","average","Edition","ages","absence","psychiatric disorders","MATERIALS","METHODS","presence","OBJECTIVE","decrements","CONCLUSIONS","teachers","RESULTS","years","aim"],"language":"en"},

Immunosensors incorporate the specific immunochemical reaction with the modern transducers including electrochemical (potentiometric, conductometric, capacitative, impedance, amperometric), optical (fluorescence, luminescence, refractive index), and microgravimetric transducers. These immunosensor devices with dramatic improvements in the sensitivity and selectivity possess the abilities to investigate the reaction dynamics of antibody\u2013antigen binding and the potential to revolutionize conventional immunoassay techniques. With the rapid development of immunological reagents and detection equipments, immunosensors have allowed an increasing range of analytes to be identified and quantified and in particular, simple-to-use, inexpensive, and reliable immunosensing systems have been developed for areas such as outpatient monitoring, large screening programs, and remote environmental surveillance. Immunosensors with lowered detection limits and increased sensitivities have been developed in various fields, particularly in clinical analysis. A noticeable development trend is also observed in the development of immunosensors combining with other techniques such as flow injection analysis (FIA) or capillary electrophoretic (CE) analysis, which complement and improve the present immunoassay methods. Belov et al. have proposed a novel immunophenotyping method for leukemias which uses a cluster of differentiation antibody microarray, and a microarray of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been developed for autoimmune diagnosis of systematic rheumatic disease. Development of microfluidic immunosensor systems for proteomics and drug discovery have also been reported in recent years where the microfluidic system integrates multiple processes in a single device to improve analytical performance by reducing the reagent consumption and the analysis time, and increasing reliability and sensitivity through automation.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hua; Shen, Guoli; Yu, Ruqin","journal":"Electrochemical Sensors, Biosensors and their Biomedical Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7921dddae344003214db8484cb84e7ccae23c42c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150224.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123737380500118; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123737380500118","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of immunosensors","field of immunosensors","Development of microfluidic immunosensor systems","analysis time","clinical analysis","flow injection analysis","sensitivity","noticeable development trend","rapid development of immunological reagents","reaction dynamics of antibody","conventional immunoassay techniques","microarray of enzyme","detection equipments","modern transducers","microfluidic system","cluster of differentiation antibody microarray","microgravimetric transducers","recent years","immunosensor devices","recent developments","lowered detection limits","specific immunochemical reaction","reliable immunosensing systems","increasing range of analytes","present immunoassay methods","large screening programs","conductometric","FIA","increased sensitivities","potential","proteomics","single device","refractive index","multiple processes","antigen binding","use","leukemias","fluorescence","amperometric","analytical performance","impedance","capacitative","outpatient monitoring","areas","linked immunosorbent assay","reagent consumption","dramatic improvements","drug discovery","remote environmental surveillance","autoimmune diagnosis of systematic rheumatic disease","various fields","novel immunophenotyping method","luminescence","chapter","selectivity","abilities","reliability","Publisher Summary","Belov"],"language":"en"},

To explore if the least expressed ORF, ORF 3b, which encodes a nonstructural protein, is evolutionarily conserved and functionally indispensable for viral propagation in cultured cells, the Beaudette strain of IBV was propagated in chicken embryonated eggs for three passages and then adapted to a monkey kidney cell line, Vero. The 3b gene of passage 3 in embryonated eggs and passages 7, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 50, and 65 in Vero cells were amplified by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The results showed that viral RNA extracted from passages 35, 50, and 65 contained a single A insertion in a 6A stretch of the 3b gene between nucleotides 24075 and 24080, whereas the early passages carried the normal 3b gene. This insertion resulted in a frameshift event and therefore, if expressed, a C-terminally truncated protein. We showed that the frameshifting product, cloned in a plasmid, was expressed in vitro and in cells transfected with the mutant construct. The normal product of the 3b gene is 64 amino acids long, whereas the frameshifting product is 34 amino acids long with only 17 homogeneous amino acid residues at the N-terminal half. Immunofluorescent studies revealed that the normal 3b protein was localized to the nucleus and the truncated product showed a \u201Cfree\u201D distribution pattern, indicating that the C-terminal portion of 3b was responsible for its nuclear localization. Comparison of the complete genome sequences (27.6 kb) of isolates p20c22 and p36c12 (from passages 20 and 36, respectively) revealed that p36c12 contains three amino acid substitutions, two in the 195-kDa protein (encoded by gene 1) and one in the S protein, in addition to the frameshifting 3b product. Further characterization of the two isolates demonstrated that p36c12 showed growth advantage over p20c22 in both Vero cells and chicken embryos and was more virulent in chicken embryos than p20c22. These results suggest that the 3b gene product is not essential for the replication of IBV.","publish_time":"2003-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, S; Wen, Z. L; Liu, D.

There is current uncertainty regarding the role of tracheostomy for weaning ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. This is due to a number of factors including prognosis, optimal healthcare resource utilisation, and safety of healthcare workers when performing such a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure. METHODS: Literature review and proposed practical guideline based on the experience of a tertiary healthcare institution with 195 critical care admissions for COVID-19 up until 4th April 2020. RESULTS: A synthesis of the current international literature and reported experience is presented with respect to prognosis, viral load and staff safety, thus leading to a pragmatic recommendation that tracheostomy is not performed until at least 14 days after endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients. Practical steps to minimise aerosol generation in percutaneous tracheostomy are outlined and we describe the process and framework for setting up a dedicated tracheostomy team. CONCLUSION: In selected COVID-19 patients, there is a role for tracheostomy to aid in weaning and optimise healthcare resource utilisation. Both percutaneous and open techniques can be performed safely with careful modifications to technique and appropriate enhanced personal protective equipment. ORL-HNS surgeons can play a valuable role in forming tracheostomy teams to support critical care teams during this global pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takhar, Arunjit; Walker, Abigail; Tricklebank, Stephen; Wyncoll, Duncan; Hart, Nicholas; Jacob, Tony; Arora, Asit; Skilbeck, Christopher; Simo, Ricard; Surda, Pavol","journal":"Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33dbab43b88aae90d46ee353a53464347076cca3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7170707.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32314050/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-05993-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of tracheostomy","tracheostomy teams","percutaneous tracheostomy","selected COVID","critical care teams","dedicated tracheostomy team","critical care services","critical care admissions","safety of healthcare workers","optimal healthcare resource utilisation","prognosis","tertiary healthcare institution","valuable role","ventilated patients","weaning","current international literature","reported experience","staff safety","Literature review","aerosol generation","global pandemic","Practical steps","practical guideline","high-risk aerosol","current uncertainty","appropriate enhanced personal protective equipment","unprecedented demand","invasive mechanical ventilation","careful modifications","viral load","respect","synthesis","number of factors","endotracheal intubation","ORL-HNS surgeons","METHODS","days","framework","pneumonia","open techniques","pragmatic recommendation","procedure","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE","process"],"language":"en"},

However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza viruses. Research question The aim of this study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with ARDS. Study Design and Methods This analysis was a retrospective case-control study. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 (n = 73) or H1N1 (n = 75) were compared. Their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed and compared. Results The median age of patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of patients with H1N1, and there was a higher proportion of male subjects among the COVID-19 cohort (P \u003C .05). Patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of nonproductive coughs, fatigue, and GI symptoms than those of patients with H1N1 (P \u003C .05). Patients with H1N1 had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores than patients with COVID-19 (P \u003C .05). The Pao 2/Fio 2 of 198.2 mm Hg in the COVID-19 cohort was significantly higher than the Pao 2/Fio 2 of 107.0 mm Hg in the H1N1 cohort (P \u003C .001). Ground-glass opacities was more common in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with H1N1 (P \u003C .001). There was a greater variety of antiviral therapies administered to COVID-19 patients than to H1N1 patients. The in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 28.8%, whereas that of patients with H1N1 was 34.7% (P = .483).

METHODS: During two winter periods, respiratory virus real-time multiplex PCR results were evaluated from children (\u003C 18 years) presenting to the emergency department of a tertiary referral hospital with ARTI that had been sampled within 48 hours of hospital presentation. In an attempt to identify virus-specific distinguishing clinical features, single virus infections were correlated with presenting signs and symptoms, clinical findings and outcomes using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In total, 274 children with ARTI were evaluated and most were aged \u003C 3 years (236/274, 86%). PCR detected respiratory viruses in 224/274 (81.8%) children and included 162 (59%) single and 62 (23%) mixed virus infections. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) single virus infections were common among children aged \u003C 3 years, but proportional differences compared to older children were only significant for RSV (95% CI 1.3\u201315). Clinical differentiation between viral ARTIs was not possible due to common shared presenting signs and symptoms and the high frequency of mixed viral infections. We observed virus-associated outcome differences among children aged \u003C 3 years. Oxygen treatment was associated with RSV (OR 3.6) and inversely correlated with FLU (OR 0.05). Treatment with steroids (OR 3.4) or bronchodilators (OR 3.4) was associated with HRV. Severe respiratory complications were associated with HRV (OR 3.5) and inversely correlated with RSV (OR 0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are frequently detected in young children presenting to the hospital emergency department with ARTI and require PCR diagnosis since presenting signs and symptoms are not discriminant for a type of virus. RSV and HRV bear a high burden of morbidity in the pediatric clinical setting.","publish_time":"2014-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gooskens, Jairo; van der Ploeg, Vishnu; Sukhai, Ram N; Vossen, Ann CTM; Claas, Eric CJ; Kroes, Aloys CM","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f78cf5bc61d9cc158832a1c680d8aca449785dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4276012.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-014-0297-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25491885/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARTIs"],"organizations":["ARTI","PCR","RSV","HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory syncytial virus","single virus infections","RSV","mixed virus infections","type of virus","older children","young children","HRV","years","virus-associated outcome differences","respiratory virus real-time multiplex PCR results","clinical impact of individual respiratory viruses","hospital emergency department","virus-specific distinguishing clinical features","clinical findings","symptoms","Clinical differentiation","Severe respiratory complications","common shared presenting signs","acute respiratory tract infection","pediatric clinical setting","high frequency of mixed viral infections","PCR diagnosis","tertiary referral hospital","hours of hospital presentation","viral ARTIs","proportional differences","Oxygen treatment","high burden of morbidity","human rhinovirus","winter periods","outcomes","relative incidence","multivariate logistic regression","discriminant","BACKGROUND","attempt","total","METHODS","steroids","CONCLUSIONS","bronchodilators","FLU"],"language":"en"},

Our study aims to describe changes in air pollution levels during the lockdown measures in the city of Barcelona (NE Spain), by studying the time evolution of atmospheric pollutants recorded at the urban background and traffic air quality monitoring stations. After two weeks of lockdown, urban air pollution markedly decreased but with substantial differences among pollutants. The most significant reduction was estimated for BC and NO2 (\u221245 to \u221251%), pollutants mainly related to traffic emissions. A lower reduction was observed for PM10 (\u221228 to \u221231.0%). By contrast, O3 levels increased (\u002B33 to \u002B57% of the 8 h daily maxima), probably due to lower titration of O3 by NO and the decrease of NOx in a VOC-limited environment. Relevant differences in the meteorology of these two periods were also evidenced. The low reduction for PM10 is probably related to a significant regional contribution and the prevailing secondary origin of fine aerosols, but an in-depth evaluation has to be carried out to interpret this lower decrease. There is no defined trend for the low SO2 levels, probably due to the preferential reduction in emissions from the least polluting ships. A reduction of most pollutants to minimal concentrations are expected for the forthcoming weeks because of the more restrictive actions implemented for a total lockdown, which entered into force on March 30th. There are still open questions on why PM10 levels were much less reduced than BC and NO2 and on what is the proportion of the abatement of pollution directly related to the lockdown, without meteorological interferences.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tob\u00EDas, Aurelio; Carnerero, Cristina; Reche, Cristina; Massagu\u00E9, Jordi; Via, Marta; Minguill\u00F3n, Mar\u00EDa Cruz; Alastuey, Andr\u00E9s; Querol, Xavier","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5540074d087a30edd6325caefea46451614d7aae.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720320532?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302810/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720320532; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138540","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["weeks of lockdown","lower reduction","PM10 levels","significant reduction","low reduction","air pollution levels","total lockdown","O3 levels","preferential reduction","urban air pollution","Abstract Lockdown measures","lower decrease","low SO2 levels","forthcoming weeks","abatement of pollution","traffic emissions","force","BC","NO2","lower titration of O3","time evolution of atmospheric pollutants","traffic air quality monitoring stations","urban background","NE Spain","substantial differences","decrease of NOx","epidemic curve","Relevant differences","significant regional contribution","prevailing secondary origin of fine aerosols","restrictive actions","city of Barcelona","minimal concentrations","defined trend","changes","SARS-CoV","VOC-limited environment","in-depth evaluation","meteorology","start","proportion","open questions","polluting ships","h daily maxima","study","meteorological interferences","contrast","periods"],"language":"en"},

Abstract During their medical studies, students must acquire basic competencies in different areas of knowledge, one of which is infectious diseases. Training in infectious diseases is essential for general medical practice and for academic or professional expertise in many areas of medicine, both medical and surgical. The vast amount of knowledge that is continuously generated about infectious diseases requires a well-structured undergraduate medical education program and framed in a setting dominated by globalization. The incorporation of Spain to the European higher education area has forced medical schools to adapt their curriculum and to establish the content and learning objectives of all courses of study. In this paper, we discuss the implications of the integration of the Spanish university system in the European higher education area (\u00ABBologna Process\u00BB) in the teaching of infectious diseases in the Degree of Medicine, and describe the learning program in infectious diseases of the University Miguel Hern\u00E1ndez of Elche (Alicante, Spain) based on learning outcomes and competencies.","publish_time":"2016-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guti\u00E9rrez, F\u00E9lix; Masi\u00E1, Mar","journal":"Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiolog\u00EDa Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/afb17c1b5acdd0b56cc4956ef7fa7dcf37b4131a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103342.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213005X15000658; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213005X15000658","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Universidad Miguel Hern\u00E1ndez de Elche","students must acquire basic","the University"],"locations":["Espa\u00F1a","Alicante","Spain"],"keyphrases":["in the Degree of","in the teaching of infectious","of all","The incorporation of Spain","of study","of the University Miguel Hern\u00E1ndez of Elche","the learning program in infectious","we discuss the implications of the integration of the Spanish university system in the European higher education area","in different areas of knowledge","The vast amount of knowledge that","one of which","Training in infectious","establish the content and learning","curriculum and","both medical and surgical","essential for general medical practice and for academic or professional expertise in many areas of","enfermedades infecciosas","structured undergraduate medical education program and framed in a setting dominated by globalization","facultades de Medicina","estudios de Medicina","forced medical schools","Alicante","continuously generated about infectious","espacio europeo","educaci\u00F3n superior","programa de aprendizaje","patolog\u00EDa infecciosa","Universidad Miguel Hern\u00E1ndez de Elche","based on learning","competencias b\u00E1sicas","\u00E1reas de conocimiento","pr\u00E1ctica m\u00E9dica general","students must acquire basic","well","adapt","Bologna Process","sistema universitario espa\u00F1ol","paper","especializaci\u00F3n acad\u00E9mica","integraci\u00F3n","Plan Bolonia","entorno dominado","implicaciones","objetivos docentes","contenidos","incorporaci\u00F3n de Espa\u00F1a","resultados","docencia","Abstract During","planes de ense\u00F1anza","formaci\u00F3n","materias de estudio","gran cantidad de conocimientos","globalizaci\u00F3n","art\u00EDculo","Resumen"],"language":"es"},

However, traditional SPM neglects the pattern repetition in sequence. To solve this problem, gap constraint SPM was proposed and can avoid finding too many useless patterns. Nonoverlapping SPM, as a branch of gap constraint SPM, means that any two occurrences cannot use the same sequence letter in the same position as the occurrences. Nonoverlapping SPM can make a balance between efficiency and completeness. The frequent patterns discovered by existing methods normally contain redundant patterns. To reduce redundant patterns and improve the mining performance, this paper adopts the closed pattern mining strategy and proposes a complete algorithm, named Nettree for Nonoverlapping Closed Sequential Pattern (NetNCSP) based on the Nettree structure. NetNCSP is equipped with two key steps, support calculation and closeness determination. A backtracking strategy is employed to calculate the nonoverlapping support of a pattern on the corresponding Nettree, which reduces the time complexity. This paper also proposes three kinds of pruning strategies, inheriting, predicting, and determining. These pruning strategies are able to find the redundant patterns effectively since the strategies can predict the frequency and closeness of the patterns before the generation of the candidate patterns. Experimental results show that NetNCSP is not only more efficient but can also discover more closed patterns with good compressibility. Furtherly, in biological experiments NetNCSP mines the closed patterns in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS viruses. The results show that the two viruses are of similar pattern composition with different combinations.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Youxi; Zhu, Changrui; Li, Yan; Guo, Lei; Wu, Xindong","journal":"Knowl Based Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93c00ba75eff9df14c2146bac171d72cac019c8b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118609.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0950705120301945; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705120301945; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2020.105812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292248/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["closed patterns","redundant patterns","Nonoverlapping SPM","frequent patterns","candidate patterns","useless patterns","closed pattern mining strategy","pattern repetition","traditional SPM","Abstract Sequential pattern mining","nonoverlapping support","branch of gap constraint SPM","similar pattern composition","mining performance","paper","biological experiments NetNCSP","corresponding Nettree","SARS viruses","Nettree structure","kinds of pruning strategies","occurrences","closeness determination","support calculation","SARS-CoV","sequence letter","backtracking strategy","Experimental results","key steps","complete algorithm","existing methods","different combinations","balance","generation","efficiency","problem","good compressibility","frequency","time complexity","completeness","fields"],"language":"en"},

A thin-film based PCR device was fabricated using picosecond laser (PS-laser) ablation of the multilayer graphene (MLG). Under the optimal fluence of 4.72 J/cm2 with a pulse overlap of 66%, the MLG can be patterned with arrays of 250 \u03BCm2 hole surface structures. A 354-bp DNA fragment of VP1, an effective marker for diagnosing the BK virus, was amplified on an on-chip device in less than 60 min. A thin-film electrode with the aforementioned MLG as the heater was demonstrated to significantly enhance temperature stability for each stage of the thermal cycle.

Nevertheless, scarce information was present dealing with the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of these infections in Greece and the efficacy of currently applied control strategies. To fill this gap, a specific epidemiological study was designed. A total of 106 broiler and layer farms, including 10 backyard and 96 commercial flocks, were sampled between March 2016 and May 2017, and the obtained tracheal swabs were tested for IBV and aMPV using RT-PCR based techniques followed by sequencing. For each farm, data regarding production type, flock features, clinical signs, and vaccination program were also recorded. Different associations between vaccination protocol, production type, animal category, birds density, age, presence of clinical signs, and IBV and/or aMPV infection were tested. Both IBV and aMPV field strain prevalence were proven high, approximately 20 and 30%, respectively, being the GI-19 lineage (14 out of 19; 73.6%) and B subtype (30 out of 30; 100%), the most commonly detected IBV and aMPV genetic types. Infection with IBV field strains was significantly associated with clinical sign presence (odds ratio = 8.55 [95CI = 2.17\u201342.90]). Remarkably, only the vaccination protocol involving a double vaccination at 1 D of age was proven protective against IBV-induced symptomatology, with the odds of developing disease being 4.14 [95CI = 1.34\u201314.51] times lower. No association was demonstrated between aMPV infection and clinical outbreaks or between aMPV and IBV detection, suggesting the marginal role of the former pathogen in poultry farming. Globally, the present study provides the first detailed investigation of the epidemiological scenario of 2 viruses traditionally considered of pivotal relevance in poultry farming and demonstrates that remarkable benefits could be obtained with just minor adjustments in vaccination protocols.","publish_time":"2019-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andreopoulou, Marianna; Franzo, Giovanni; Tucciarone, Claudia M; Prentza, Zoi; Koutoulis, Konstantinos C; Cecchinato, Mattia; Chaligianni, Ilias","journal":"Poult Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53e849cb6cad5114d626a08de15b2898128e0dfe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107232.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31264704/; https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez360","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Greece"],"keyphrases":["aMPV infection","IBV detection","detected IBV","IBV field strains","IBV-induced symptomatology","poultry production","aMPV field strain prevalence","double vaccination","aMPV genetic types","vaccination protocols","vaccination program","presence of clinical signs","production type","clinical outbreaks","poultry farming","clinical sign presence","present study","specific epidemiological study","D of age","present dealing","odds ratio","epidemiological scenario","odds of developing disease","obtained tracheal swabs","animal category","birds density","flock features","infectious bronchitis virus","molecular epidemiology","efficacy","Greece","infections","data","detailed investigation","Respiratory diseases","marginal role","RT-PCR","avian metapneumovirus","Different associations","backyard","layer farms","viruses","techniques","pivotal relevance","pathogen","major losses","scarce information","minor adjustments","remarkable benefits","applied control strategies","total","broiler","gap","commercial flocks","sequencing","times lower","lineage","B subtype"],"language":"en"},

A HuNoV replicon system has been widely applied to the evaluation of antiviral compounds and has thus accelerated the process of drug discovery against HuNoV infection. Rupintrivir, an irreversible inhibitor of the human rhinovirus 3C protease, has been reported to inhibit the replication of the Norwalk virus replicon via the inhibition of the norovirus protease. Here we report, for the first time, the generation of rupintrivir-resistant human Norwalk virus replicon cells in vitro. Sequence analysis revealed that these replicon cells contained amino acid substitutions of alanine 105 to valine (A105V) and isoleucine 109 to valine (I109V) in the viral protease NS6. The application of a cell-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for protease activity demonstrated that these substitutions were involved in the enhanced resistance to rupintrivir. Furthermore, we validated the effect of these mutations using reverse genetics in murine norovirus (MNV), demonstrating that a recombinant MNV strain with a single I109V substitution in the protease also showed reduced susceptibility to rupintrivir. In summary, using a combination of different approaches, we have demonstrated that, under the correct conditions, mutations in the norovirus protease that lead to the generation of resistant mutants can rapidly occur.","publish_time":"2018-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kitano, Mitsutaka; Hosmillo, Myra; Emmott, Edward; Lu, Jia; Goodfellow, Ian","journal":"Antimicrob Agents Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09f45d217e1c1b2fa23694b9adf79340d192d924.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5923142.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5923142/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["norovirus protease","Human norovirus","protease activity","C protease","generation of rupintrivir","HuNoV replicon system","viral protease NS6","resistant human Norwalk virus replicon cells","murine norovirus","human rhinovirus","valine","mutations","HuNoV infection","generation of resistant mutants","single I109V substitution","recombinant MNV strain","amino acid substitutions of alanine","FRET","cell-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer","assay","reverse genetics","inhibition","irreversible inhibitor","process of drug discovery","impact","major cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis","A105V","isoleucine","correct conditions","reduced susceptibility","society","vaccines","antivirals","application","effect","enhanced resistance","Sequence analysis","replication","combination of different approaches","evaluation of antiviral compounds","summary","time"],"language":"en"},

Although LMP1 is one of the latent genes required for EBV-immortalization of B cells, the biology of LMP1 in the pathogenesis of the epithelial cancer nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is more complex. NPC is prevalent in specific regions of the world with high incidence in southeast China. The epidemiology and time interval from seroconversion to NPC onset in adults would suggest the involvement of multiple risk factors that complement the establishment of a latent and persistent EBV infection. The contribution of LMP1 to EBV pathogenesis in polarized epithelia has only recently begun to be elucidated. Furthermore, the LMP1 gene has emerged as one of the most divergent sequences in the EBV genome.

Parameters such as genetic distances, N-glycosylation patterns, recombination events, selective pressures, and its codon adaptation to human genes are assessed. Our study is noteworthy for the observation of N-glycosylation and recombination in Bagaza virus and provides insight into its Indian origin from the 13th century. Interestingly, evidence of Bagaza virus codon adaptation to human house-keeping genes is also observed to be higher than those of other flaviviruses well known in human infections. Genetic variations on genome of West African Bagaza virus could play an important role in generating diversity and may promote Bagaza virus adaptation to other vertebrates and become an important threat in human health.","publish_time":"2018-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faye, Martin; Faye, Oumar; Diagne, Moussa Moise; Fall, Gamou; Weidmann, Manfred; Sembene, Mbacke; Sall, Amadou Alpha; Faye, Ousmane","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2769723b9b497b45c8178f8f68dc48a5fed06db6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5923487.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5923487/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Central Africa","Europe","Africa","India","West"],"keyphrases":["Bagaza virus adaptation","evolution of Bagaza virus","genome of West African Bagaza virus","evidence of Bagaza virus codon adaptation","genetic diversity","genetic evolution","human genes","West African isolates","genetic distances","Genetic variations","diversity of isolates","human house","human health","human infections","Central African Republic","N-glycosylation patterns","serological evidence","recombination events","observation of N","genome characterization","important threat","important role","mosquito pools","Europe","selective pressures","encephalitis patients","wild birds","questions","field","insight","vertebrates","Indian origin","Emergence","flaviviruses","Parameters","century","study"],"language":"en"},

Here, we evaluated whether the sequence similarity of various antigens to the microbiota dampens or increases immunogenicity of T cell epitopes. Sets of epitopes and control sequences derived from 38 antigenic categories (infectious pathogens, allergens, autoantigens) were retrieved from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Their similarity to microbiome sequences was calculated using the BLOSUM62 matrix. We found that sequence similarity was associated with either dampened (tolerogenic; e.g. most allergens) or increased (inflammatory; e.g. Dengue and West Nile viruses) likelihood of a peptide being immunogenic as a function of epitope source category. Ten-fold cross-validation and validation using sets of manually curated epitopes and non-epitopes derived from allergens were used to confirm these initial observations. Furthermore, the genus from which the microbiome homologous sequences were derived influenced whether a tolerogenic versus inflammatory modulatory effect was observed, with Fusobacterium most associated with inflammatory influences and Bacteroides most associated with tolerogenic influences. We validated these effects using PBMCs stimulated with various sets of microbiome peptides. \u201CTolerogenic\u201D microbiome peptides elicited IL-10 production, \u201Cinflammatory\u201D peptides elicited mixed IL-10/IFN\u03B3 production, while microbiome epitopes homologous to self were completely unreactive for both cytokines. We also tested the sequence similarity of cockroach epitopes to specific microbiome sequences derived from households of cockroach allergic individuals and non-allergic controls. Microbiomes from cockroach allergic households were less likely to contain sequences homologous to previously defined cockroach allergens. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that microbiome sequences may contribute to the tolerization of T cells for allergen epitopes, and lack of these sequences might conversely be associated with increased likelihood of T cell reactivity against the cockroach epitopes. Taken together this study suggests that microbiome sequence similarity influences immune reactivity to homologous epitopes encoded by pathogens, allergens and auto-antigens.","publish_time":"2018-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carrasco Pro, Sebastian; Lindestam Arlehamn, Cecilia S.; Dhanda, Sandeep K.; Carpenter, Chelsea; Lindvall, Mikaela; Faruqi, Ali A.; Santee, Clark A.; Renz, Harald; Sidney, John; Peters, Bjoern; Sette, Alessandro","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9162c1be900c7bab2cc52de3e8cdef666c4824c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5937769.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5937769/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Immune Epitope Database"],"locations":["West Nile"],"keyphrases":["microbiome epitopes homologous","microbiome homologous sequences","homologous epitopes","microbiome sequence similarity","sequence similarity of cockroach epitopes","specific microbiome sequences","sequences homologous","non-epitopes","allergen epitopes","curated epitopes","inflammatory influences","tolerogenic influences","immunogenicity of T cell epitopes","various sets of microbiome peptides","control sequences","defined cockroach allergens","cockroach allergic households","sequence similarity of various antigens","molecular mimicry influences T cell reactivity","increased likelihood of T cell reactivity","households of cockroach allergic individuals","immune reactivity","tolerization of T cells","non-allergic controls","inflammatory modulatory effect","Immune Epitope Database","IFN\u03B3 production","infectious pathogens","mixed IL","fold cross-validation","function of epitope source category","adaptive immunity","antigenic categories","Bacteroides","West Nile viruses","Dengue","Fusobacterium","microbiota","self","autoantigens","PBMCs","hypothesis","lack","IEDB","effects","Microbiomes","study","genus","BLOSUM62 matrix","results","cytokines","initial observations"],"language":"en"},

However, despite the high occurrence of rs12252-CC genotype in Chinese population (~25%), severe influenza infection is rare. The aim of study is to determine whether rs12252-CC individuals have pre-existing antibody responses to previous seasonal influenza infections. Cohort and Method: A total 99 young healthy volunteers (18\u201320 years) were recruited and received an influenza seasonal Vaccination [A/Switzerland/9715293/2013(H3N2), A/California/7/2009 (pdm09H1N1) and B/Jeep/3073/2013-like virus (Flu-B)]. Plasma and gDNA was isolated from each volunteer before, and 14, 28, 180, 360, and 540 days after vaccination. Additionally, 68 elderlies (\u003E65 years) were also recruited as a control group to compare the levels of antibodies at baseline between the young adults and the elderly. For each sample IFITM3 rs12252 genotype was determined and antibody levels in response to pdmH1N1, H3N2 and Influenza B infection were measured for each time point. Results: We found a significantly higher level of pre-existing antibodies to pandemic influenza H1N1/09 virus (pdm09H1N1) but not to H3N2 or FluB in CC donors in comparison with CT/TT donors prior to vaccination. No impact of IFITM3 genotype in boosting influenza specific antibodies in young adults within 1 year after receiving seasonal influenza vaccination was observed. In addition, there was no difference in pdm09H1N1 specific antibody levels observed in the elderly cohort between volunteers carrying different IFITM3 genotypes. Higher levels of antibodies to pdmH1N1 were observed in elderly CC carriers when compared to the young CC carriers, but this trend was not replicated in TT carriers. Conclusion: IFITM3-rs12252 CC carriers exhibit a high level of pre-existing immunity to pdm09H1N1 compared to TT carriers in the young cohort. This suggests that compensatory mechanisms exist which might contribute to viral control in patients carrying the rs12252-CC genotype who do not become sick after flu infection.

Human tetherin (huTHN) has been reported to restrict only specific FLUAV strains and the viral hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes determine the sensitivity to huTHN.

To what extent does viral fitness result from specific molecular interactions with host factors and regulatory networks during infection? Can we identify host genes in functional classes whose expression depends on viral fitness? Here, we compared the transcriptomes of tobacco plants infected with seven genotypes of tobacco etch potyvirus that differ in fitness. We found that the larger the fitness differences among genotypes, the more dissimilar the transcriptomic profiles are. Consistently, two different mutations, one in the viral RNA polymerase and another in the viral suppressor of RNA silencing, resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified host genes whose expression showed a significant correlation, positive or negative, with the virus\u0027 fitness. Differentially expressed genes which were positively correlated with viral fitness activate hormone- and RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense. In contrast, those that were negatively correlated with fitness affect metabolism, reducing growth, and development. Overall, these results reveal the high information content of viral fitness and suggest its potential use to predict differences in genomic profiles of infected hosts.","publish_time":"2018-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cervera, H\u00E9ctor; Ambr\u00F3s, Silvia; Bernet, Guillermo P; Rodrigo, Guillermo; Elena, Santiago F","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6e907e13f516564479fe71e2904d14cad572f15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5995217.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5995217/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Differentially"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fitness of viral genotypes","fitness differences","viral fitness result","Darwinian fitness","high information content of viral fitness","viral RNA polymerase","stage of viral infection","viral suppressor of RNA silencing","host genes","genotypes of tobacco","host factors","similar gene expression profiles","transcriptomic profiles","genomic profiles of infected hosts","RNA silencing-mediated pathways of plant defense","potential use","evolutionary potential","transcriptomes of tobacco plants","specific molecular interactions","performance","regulatory networks","significant correlation","functional classes","reference","advantage","hormone","standard practice","given genotype","respect","extent","single figure","virology","results","metabolism","growth","potyvirus","complex property","different mutations","development","contrast"],"language":"en"},

We describe the functional significance of the PGRS domain of Rv0297, a member of this family. In silico analyses revealed the presence of intrinsically disordered stretches and putative endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization signals in the PGRS domain of Rv0297 (Rv0297PGRS). The PGRS domain aids in ER localization, which was shown by infecting macrophage cells with M. tuberculosis and by overexpressing the protein by transfection in macrophage cells followed by activation of the unfolded protein response, as evident from increased expression of GRP78/GRP94 and CHOP/ATF4, leading to disruption of intracellular Ca(2\u002B) homeostasis and increased nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The consequent activation of the effector caspase-8 resulted in apoptosis of macrophages, which was Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent. Administration of recombinant Rv0297PGRS (rRv0297PGRS) also exhibited similar effects. These results implicate a hitherto-unknown role of the PGRS domain of the PE_PGRS protein family in ER stress-mediated cell death through TLR4. Since this protein is already known to be present at later stages of infection in human granulomas it points to the possibility of it being employed by M. tuberculosis for its dissemination via an apoptotic mechanism.","publish_time":"2018-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grover, Sonam; Sharma, Tarina; Singh, Yadvir; Kohli, Sakshi; P., Manjunath; Singh, Aditi; Semmler, Torsten; Wieler, Lothar H.; Tedin, Karsten; Ehtesham, Nasreen Z.; Hasnain, Seyed E.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d921cd2d71ffa5577a0d2c534da20f6780b3a564.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6016250.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6016250/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc40","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PE/PPE","PGRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PGRS family","PGRS protein family","PGRS domain of Rv0297","PGRS domain aids","unique protein family","ER localization","unfolded protein response","genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis","causal organism of tuberculosis","TLR4","infecting macrophage cells","localization signals","consequent activation","genus Mycobacterium","ER stress-mediated cell death","increased expression of GRP78","increased nitric oxide","Administration of recombinant Rv0297PGRS","putative endoplasmic reticulum","disordered stretches","human granulomas","reactive oxygen species","ATF4","presence","CHOP","rRv0297PGRS","homeostasis","later stages of infection","GRP94","TB","PPE","ROS","production","Toll","effector caspase","unknown role","transfection","disruption of intracellular Ca","member","living kingdom","functional significance","unexplored functions","apoptosis of macrophages","receptor","dissemination","silico analyses","similar effects","apoptotic mechanism","possibility","results","dependent"],"language":"en"},

In their hosts, geminivirus populations behave as ensembles of mutant and recombinant genomes, known as viral quasispecies. This favors the emergence of new geminiviruses with altered host range, facilitating new or more severe diseases or overcoming resistance traits. In warm and temperate areas several whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses of the genus Begomovirus cause the tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD) with significant economic consequences. TYLCD is frequently controlled in commercial tomatoes by using the dominant Ty-1 resistance gene. Over a 45 day period we have studied the diversification of three begomoviruses causing TYLCD: tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) and tomato yellow leaf curl Malaga virus (TYLCMaV, a natural recombinant between TYLCV and TYLCSV). Viral quasispecies resulting from inoculation of geminivirus infectious clones were examined in plants of susceptible tomato (ty-1/ty-1), heterozygous resistant tomato (Ty-1/ty-1), common bean, and the wild reservoir Solanum nigrum. Differences in virus fitness across hosts were observed while viral consensus sequences remained invariant. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of the quasispecies were high, especially in common bean and the wild host. Interestingly, the presence or absence of the Ty-1 allele in tomato did not lead to differences in begomovirus mutant spectra. However, the fitness decrease of TYLCSV and TYLCV in tomato at 45 dpi might be related to an increase in CP (Coat protein) mutation frequency. In Solanum nigrum the recombinant TYLCMaV, which showed lower fitness than TYLCSV, at 45 dpi actively explored Rep (Replication associated protein) ORF but not the overlapping C4. Our results underline the importance of begomovirus mutant spectra during infections. This is especially relevant in the wild reservoir of the viruses, which has the potential to maintain highly diverse mutant spectra without modifying their consensus sequences.","publish_time":"2018-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"S\u00E1nchez-Campos, Sonia; Dom\u00EDnguez-Huerta, Guillermo; D\u00EDaz-Mart\u00EDnez, Luis; Tom\u00E1s, Diego M.; Navas-Castillo, Jes\u00FAs; Moriones, Enrique; Grande-P\u00E9rez, Ana","journal":"Front Plant Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de452bf070bb2c100cab63901495507c492e6ada.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6036239.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6036239/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzExNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TYLCV","TYLCSV","ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["tomato yellow leaf curl virus","tomato yellow leaf curl disease","tomato yellow leaf curl Malaga virus","tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus","virus fitness","dominant Ty","plants of susceptible tomato","heterozygous resistant tomato","TYLCD","TYLCV","wild host","viral quasispecies","importance of begomovirus mutant spectra","diverse mutant spectra","fitness decrease of TYLCSV","recombinant TYLCMaV","recombinant genomes","ensembles of mutant","viral consensus sequences","wild reservoir Solanum nigrum","genus Begomovirus","natural recombinant","emergence of new geminiviruses","hosts","common bean","lower fitness","Differences","whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses","altered host range","Coat protein","plant host cell nuclei","geminivirus populations","resistance traits","resistance gene","Replication associated protein","circular DNA genomes","inoculation of geminivirus infectious clones","cellular polymerases","ORF","CP","temperate areas","explored Rep","begomoviruses","severe diseases","mutation frequency","diversification","significant economic consequences","potential","commercial tomatoes","infections","family Geminiviridae","increase","heterogeneity","absence","results","allele","overlapping C4","day period","complexity","presence"],"language":"en"},

Finally, all three cytokines with increased secretion in different stages of MS (i.e., VEGF-C, TNF-\u03B1, and LT-\u03B1) enhance lymphangiogenesis, suggesting that intrathecal B cells directly facilitate the formation of tertiary lymphoid follicles, thus compartmentalizing inflammation to the central nervous system.","publish_time":"2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stein, Jason; Xu, Quangang; Jackson, Kayla C.; Romm, Elena; Wuest, Simone C.; Kosa, Peter; Wu, Tianxia; Bielekova, Bibiana","journal":"Front Neurol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9c267b7dcc9a8348248c04a8bf604aa52926101.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6062589.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6062589/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzEzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSF","BCL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MS-DSS","MS phenotype","CSF B cells","Progressive MS patients BCLs","B cell secretion of IL","LT-\u03B1 secretion","MS subjects\u0027 BCLs","different stages of MS","intrathecal B cells","based B cell","B cell depletion","B cell lines","control-subject B cells","cytokine secretion","RRMS patients","higher TNF-\u03B1","pathogenic functions of B cells","generated CSF BCL","validation cohort","MS disease severity scale","increased secretion","GM-CSF","pilot cohort","lower secretion of IL","control BCLs","control subjects","cytokine production","enhanced VEGF-C production","different cytokines","diagnostic categories","intracellular cytokine staining","immortalization efficiency","times higher","significant differences","tumor necrosis factor","non-inflammatory neurological diseases","vascular endothelial growth factor","compartmentalizing inflammation","NIND","disability","OIND","effective therapy of multiple sclerosis","formation of tertiary lymphoid follicles","flow-cytometry","lymphangiogenesis","Epstein-Barr Virus","healthy volunteers","central nervous system","objective","EBV","ELISA","controls","cerebrospinal fluid","lymphotoxin","relapsing","rate of accumulation","HV","unblinding"],"language":"en"},

This uncommon RNA virus trait provides influenza with the advantage of access to the nuclear machinery during replication.

The segmentation of the influenza genome makes these additional trafficking requirements especially challenging, as each viral RNA (vRNA) gene segment must navigate the network of cellular membrane barriers during the processes of entry and assembly. To accomplish this goal, influenza A viruses (IAVs) utilize a combination of viral and cellular mechanisms to coordinate the transport of their proteins and the eight vRNA gene segments in and out of the cell. The aim of this review is to present the current mechanistic understanding for how IAVs facilitate cell entry, replication, virion assembly, and intercellular movement, in an effort to highlight some of the unanswered questions regarding the coordination of the IAV infection process.","publish_time":"2018-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dou, Dan; Revol, Rebecca; \u00D6stbye, Henrik; Wang, Hao; Daniels, Robert","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd18832006ef03fab74bf51388034b7e9605e14a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6062596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6062596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzEzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenza viruses","viral RNA","influenza genome","cell entry","IAVs","combination of viral","replication","viral components","host cell","vRNA gene segments","processes of entry","virion assembly","cellular mechanisms","intracellular trafficking","productive infection","additional trafficking requirements","IAV infection process","network of cellular membrane barriers","uncommon RNA virus trait","advantage of access","coordination","current mechanistic understanding","intercellular movement","nuclear machinery","proteins","nucleus","review","unanswered questions","effort","transport","goal","complexity","segmentation","aim"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated characteristics of the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak to elucidate lessons learned for managing transnational public health security threats. METHODS: We used publically available data to compare demographic and outbreak-specific data for Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, including key indicator data by the World Health Organization. Pearson correlation statistics were calculated to compare country-level infrastructure characteristics with outbreak size and duration. RESULTS: Hospital bed density was inversely correlated with longer EVD outbreak duration (r = \u2212 0.99). Country-specific funding amount allocations were more likely associated with number of incident cases than the population at-risk or infrastructure needs. Key indicators demonstrating challenges for Guinea included: number of unsafe burials, percent of EVD-positive samples, and days between symptom onset and case hospitalization. Sierra Leone\u2019s primary key indicator was the number of districts with \u22651 security incident. Liberia controlled their outbreak before much of the key-indicator data were collected. CONCLUSION: Many of the country-level factors, particularly the WHO key indicators were associated with controlling the epidemic.

There have been numerous studies that have reported that T cells serve major roles in tumor progression. However, the function of CXC motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) in prostate cancer remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the role of CXCL9 in prostate cancer. A prostate cancer mouse model was generated by treating C57/BL-6 and B6.Cg-Selplgtm1Fur/J mice with 3,2\u2032-dimethyl 4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB). Hematoxylin and eosin staining detected the histopathological alterations of mouse prostate tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining determined cell proliferation of the mice. Flow cytometry was used to detect the alterations of T cells in C57\u002BDMAB or CXCL9\u002BDMAB mice. Immunofluorescence revealed that there was positive expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B2 in the mouse tissues. The survival rates of C57\u002BDMAB and CXCL9\u002BDMAB mice was analyzed. The association of CXCL9 expression and clinical stages was also evaluated. Results revealed that prostate cancer pathology and cell proliferation in CXCL9\u002BDMAB mice were significantly greater compared with the C57\u002BDMAB mice. Compared with C57\u002BDMAB mice, the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen of CXCL9\u002BDMAB mice was significantly reduced. IHC demonstrated that the expression of IL-6 and TGF-\u03B2 was significantly downregulated in the CXCL9\u002BDMAB mice. The survival rate of CXCL9\u002BDMAB mice was significantly decreased compared with the C57\u002BDMAB mice. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that CXCL9 mRNA expression in clinical samples was positively associated with clinical pathological stages of prostate cancer. In conclusion, CXCL9 may promote prostate cancer progression via inhibition of cytokines from T cells.","publish_time":"2018-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Shanfeng; Wang, Kai; Sun, Fuguang; Li, Yang; Gao, Yisheng","journal":"Mol Med Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d32ec6ce72c16f7fbedc8ac60fbdc9f8c74c6de4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6072144.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6072144/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CXC","B6.Cg-Selplgtm1Fur/J","IHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DMAB mice","role of CXCL9","spleen of CXCL9","J mice","CXCL9 mRNA expression","association of CXCL9 expression","prostate cancer progression","survival rate of CXCL9","prostate cancer pathology","prostate cancer mouse model","clinical pathological stages of prostate cancer","alterations of T cells","number of T cells","histopathological alterations of mouse prostate tissues","expression of IL","survival rates of C57","clinical stages","tumor progression","mouse tissues","cell proliferation","clinical samples","positive expression of interleukin","TGF-\u03B2","IHC","eosin staining","important role","reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis","peripheral blood","inhibition of cytokines","B6","function of CXC motif chemokine ligand","major roles","variety of diseases","Cg-Selplgtm1Fur","addition","dimethyl","growth factor","Hematoxylin","Immunohistochemistry","Results","conclusion","numerous studies","present study","Immunofluorescence","aminobiphenyl","Flow cytometry","Chemokines"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, they can also enhance other optical signals, such as fluorescence and Raman scattering, making them suitable for biosensor development. In this review, we provide a detailed discussion of the currently developed biosensors based on the aforementioned unique optical features of GNPs.

These cells have the potential to differentiate to myofibroblasts, resulting in fibrosis and scarring. The signals underlying these differing pathways are complex and incompletely understood. The ex vivo mock cataract surgery cultures are an attractive model with which to address this question. With this model we study, concurrently, the mechanisms that control mesenchymal leader cell function in injury repair within their native microenvironment and the signals that induce this same cell population to acquire a myofibroblast phenotype when these cells encounter the environment of the adjacent tissue culture platform. Here we show that on injury, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin is released into the extracellular space, binds to the cell surface of the mesenchymal leader cells located at the wound edge in the native matrix environment, and supports wound closure. In profibrotic environments, the extracellular vimentin pool also links specifically to the mesenchymal leader cells and has an essential role in signaling their fate change to a myofibroblast. These findings suggest a novel role for extracellular, cell-surface\u2013associated vimentin in mediating repair-cell function in wound repair and in transitioning these cells to a myofibroblast phenotype.","publish_time":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walker, J.

The regression equations (Y) were 12.434x \u002B 443.49, 10.08x \u002B 216.85, 11.253x \u002B 973.52 and 11.082x \u002B 446.41 whereas the coefficient correlations (r(2)) were 0.997 \u00B1 0.0004, 0.9982 \u00B1 0.0001, 0.9974 \u00B1 0.0004 and 0.9981 \u00B1 0.0001, respectively. The linearity ranges (ng/spot) were 200\u20131400 (RP-HPTLC) and 100\u20131200 (NP-HPTLC). The LOD/LOQ (ng/band) were 33.03/100.1 (rutin), 9.67/29.31 (quercetin), 35.574/107.8 (naringenin), and 12.32/37.35 (gallic acid). Gallic acid (7.01 \u03BCg/mg) was the most abundant biomarker compared to rutin (2.42 \u03BCg/mg), quercetin (1.53 \u03BCg/mg) and naringenin (0.14 \u03BCg/mg) in the extract. Conclusion: The validated NP-/RP-HPTLC methods were simple, accurate, and sensitive for separating and quantifying antiviral biomarkers in G. senegalensis, and endorsed its anti-HBV activity. The developed methods could be further employed in the standardization and quality-control of herbal formulations.","publish_time":"2017-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alam, Perwez; Parvez, Mohammad K.; Arbab, Ahmed H.; Al-Dosari, Mohammed S.","journal":"Pharm Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6dc7f0acaa45433001b3b0586094e88c0d400911.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6130481.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6130481/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzIwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LOD/LOQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gallic acid","NP-HPTLC methods","RP-HPTLC methods","quercetin","naringenin","\u03BCg","formic acid","sensitive RP","validated NP","developed methods","anti-HBV active","anti-HBV efficacy","anti-HBV activity","quantitative determination of biomarkers rutin","Guiera senegalensis","antiviral biomarkers","senegalensis leaves ethanol-extract","phase- toluene","phase- acetonitrile","antiviral activities","Combretaceae","compact spots","herpes","fowlpox","folk medicinal plant","ethyl acetate","Gmel","quality-control","Results","silica gel plates","band","herbal formulations","infectious diseases","standardization","glass","linearity ranges","LOD","LOQ","addition","Context","coefficient correlations","water","Materials","regression equations","abundant biomarker","Conclusion","RP18","ICH guidelines","Objective"],"language":"en"},

To help identify innovative solutions needed to resolve bottlenecks hampering the culture of this species, it is important to generate genetic and genomic resources. Towards this aim, we have produced the most complete publicly available P. monodon transcriptome database to date based on nine adult tissues and eight early life-history stages (BUSCO - Complete: 98.2% [Duplicated: 51.3%], Fragmented: 0.8%, Missing: 1.0%). The assembly resulted in 236,388 contigs, which were then further segregated into 99,203 adult tissue specific and 58,678 early life-history stage specific clusters. While annotation rates were low (approximately 30%), as is typical for a non-model organisms, annotated transcript clusters were successfully mapped to several hundred functional KEGG pathways. Transcripts were clustered into groups within tissues and early life-history stages, providing initial evidence for their roles in specific tissue functions, or developmental transitions.

While typically asymptomatic, HCMV can cause fatal disease among congenitally infected infants and immunocompromised patients. These clinical issues are compounded by the emergence of antiviral resistance and the absence of an effective vaccine, the development of which is likely complicated by the numerous immune evasins encoded by HCMV to counter the host\u0027s adaptive immune responses, a feature that facilitates frequent super-infections. Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of HCMV is essential for the development of effective new drugs and vaccines. By comparing viral genomes from uncultivated or low-passaged clinical samples of diverse origins, we observe evidence of frequent homologous recombination events, both recent and ancient, and no structure of HCMV genetic diversity at the whole-genome scale. Analysis of individual gene-scale loci reveals a striking dichotomy: while most of the genome is highly conserved, recombines essentially freely and has evolved under purifying selection, 21 genes display extreme diversity, structured into distinct genotypes that do not recombine with each other. Most of these hyper-variable genes encode glycoproteins involved in cell entry or escape of host immunity. Evidence that half of them have diverged through episodes of intense positive selection suggests that rapid evolution of hyper-variable loci is likely driven by interactions with host immunity. It appears that this process is enabled by recombination unlinking hyper-variable loci from strongly constrained neighboring sites. It is conceivable that viral mechanisms facilitating super-infection have evolved to promote recombination between diverged genotypes, allowing the virus to continuously diversify at key loci to escape immune detection, while maintaining a genome optimally adapted to its asymptomatic infectious lifecycle.","publish_time":"2016-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lassalle, Florent; Depledge, Daniel P.; Reeves, Matthew B.; Brown, Amanda C.; Christiansen, Mette T.; Tutill, Helena J.; Williams, Rachel J.; Einer-Jensen, Katja; Holdstock, Jolyon; Atkinson, Claire; Brown, Julianne R.; van Loenen, Freek B.; Clark, Duncan A.; Griffiths, Paul D.; Verjans, Georges M.G.M.; Schutten, Martin; Milne, Richard S.B.; Balloux, Francois; Breuer, Judith","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ab17b28c65c5fee387a2fa6c33478abd2437c9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6167919.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167919/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hyper-variable genes","key loci","genome scale","rapid evolution of hyper-variable loci","evolutionary dynamics of HCMV","structure of HCMV genetic diversity","immune detection","host immunity","diverged genotypes","evidence of frequent homologous recombination events","Analysis of individual gene-scale loci","host\u0027s adaptive immune responses","numerous immune evasins","frequent super-infections","extreme diversity","episodes of intense positive selection","development of effective new drugs","host\u0027s life","purifying selection","effective vaccine","viral mechanisms","viral genomes","clinical issues","distinct genotypes","periodic episodes of reactivation","asymptomatic infectious lifecycle","clinical samples of diverse origins","feature","latent state","fatal disease","cell entry","infected infants","absence","glycoproteins","emergence of antiviral resistance","vaccines","striking dichotomy","interactions","immunocompromised patients","neighboring sites","half","Human cytomegalovirus","population","process"],"language":"en"},

We introduce a simple new method for identifying candidate functional overlapping genes using single virus genome sequences. Our method uses randomization tests to estimate the expected length of open reading frames and then identifies overlapping open reading frames that significantly exceed this length and are thus predicted to be functional. We applied this method to 2548 reference RNA virus genomes and find that it has both high sensitivity and low false discovery for genes that overlap by at least 50 nucleotides.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with MP pneumonia hospitalized between January 2015 and April 2017. Macrolide-unresponsiveness was clinically defined with a persistent fever of \u2265 38.0\u00B0C at \u2265 72 hours after macrolide treatment.

We compared the time to defervescence (TTD) after secondary treatment and the TTD after initial macrolide treatment in each group with adjustment using propensity score-matching analysis. RESULTS: Among 1,165 cases of MP pneumonia, 190 (16.3%) were unresponsive to macrolides. The proportion of patients who achieved defervescence within 48 hours in CST, DXC, and LFX groups were 96.9% (31/33), 85.7% (12/14), and 83.3% (5/6), respectively.

They originate by a mechanism of overprinting, in which point mutations in an existing frame allow the expression (the \u0022birth\u0022) of a completely new protein from a second frame. In viruses, in which overlapping genes are abundant, these new proteins often play a critical role in infection, yet they are frequently overlooked during genome annotation. This results in erroneous interpretation of mutational studies and in a significant waste of resources. Therefore, overlapping genes need to be correctly detected, especially since they are now thought to be abundant also in eukaryotes. Developing better detection methods and conducting systematic evolutionary studies require a large, reliable benchmark dataset of known cases. We thus assembled a high-quality dataset of 80 viral overlapping genes whose expression is experimentally proven. Many of them were not present in databases. We found that overall, overlapping genes differ significantly from non-overlapping genes in their nucleotide and amino acid composition. In particular, the proteins they encode are enriched in high-degeneracy amino acids and depleted in low-degeneracy ones, which may alleviate the evolutionary constraints acting on overlapping genes. Principal component analysis revealed that the vast majority of overlapping genes follow a similar composition bias, despite their heterogeneity in length and function. Six proven mammalian overlapping genes also followed this bias. We propose that this apparently near-universal composition bias may either favour the birth of overlapping genes, or/and result from selection pressure acting on them.","publish_time":"2018-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pavesi, Angelo; Vianelli, Alberto; Chirico, Nicola; Bao, Yiming; Blinkova, Olga; Belshaw, Robert; Firth, Andrew; Karlin, David","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17192bd07c09aa9e70552f7f15f90f0a6b8180c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6195259.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195259/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["birth of overlapping genes","viral overlapping genes","non-overlapping genes","vast majority of overlapping genes","new proteins","similar composition bias","universal composition bias","systematic evolutionary studies","evolutionary constraints","amino acid composition","unrelated proteins","expression","fascinating evolutionary puzzle","high-quality dataset","high-degeneracy amino acids","existing frame","proven mammalian","low-degeneracy ones","erroneous interpretation of mutational studies","reliable benchmark dataset of known cases","nucleotide","heterogeneity","better detection methods","results","critical role","Principal component analysis","significant waste of resources","mutations","DNA sequence","length","selection pressure","function","infection","mechanism of overprinting","genome annotation","eukaryotes","viruses","databases"],"language":"en"},

The health effects of FAs are different due to the diversity of olefinic bonds in the alkyl chains including number, position and configuration. However, the discrimination of FAs is difficult from a chemical sensing perspective due to the lack of diversity in terms of functional groups. Until now, only a few chemosensors have been developed for selective sensing of FAs based on their overall shape, however they are still limited in discrimination of FAs with subtle structural differences, moreover, they cannot be used for rapid and in situ inspections. Herein, for the first time, we designed a test paper for in situ colorimetric inspection for FAs based on the combination of the highly selective binding of Ag(\u002B) to olefinic bonds and Ag(\u002B) mediated color variation of 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032,-tetramethylbenzidine. As a result, the sensor exhibited high sensitivity and good selectivity for five FAs with subtle structural differences. Furthermore, our method described herein was successfully applied to monitor the structural variations of FAs and quality changes in mixture edible hot pot oils with heat treatment in time course. Hence, the test paper presented herein holds great potential in the inspection of fats and edible oils in food industries.","publish_time":"2018-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Feng; Wang, Xiaojie; Jie, Xu; Wei, Weili","journal":"Sensors (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ec99e67f23c0c2795fad1ad551ab1abe4406841.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6210129.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6210129/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["discrimination of FAs","structural variations of FAs","selective sensing of FAs","health effects of FAs","subtle structural differences","edible oils","diversity of olefinic bonds","test paper","situ colorimetric inspection","selective binding of Ag","inspection of fats","important roles","lack of diversity","food industries","time course","situ inspections","mixture edible hot pot oils","chemical sensing perspective","areas of food science","important dietary sources of fuel","quality changes","heat treatment","good selectivity","medicine","animals","alkyl chains","high sensitivity","number","great potential","position","combination","terms of functional groups","configuration","result","biological processes","overall shape","color variation","chemosensors","Fatty acids","tetramethylbenzidine","method"],"language":"en"},

The use of corticosteroids for childhood Bell\u2019s palsy is controversial. This study aimed to identify clinical characteristics, etiology, and laboratory findings in childhood Bell\u2019s palsy, and to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of children under 19 years of age treated for Bell\u2019s palsy between January 2009 and June 2017, and followed up for over 1 month. Clinical characteristics, neuroimaging data, laboratory findings, treatments, and outcomes were reviewed. Patients with Bell\u2019s palsy were divided into groups with (group 1) and without (group 2) corticosteroid treatment. Differences in onset age, sex, laterality, infection and vaccination history, degree of facial nerve palsy, and prognosis after treatment between the groups were analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included. Mean age at presentation was 7.4\u00B15.62 years. A total of 73 patients (73%) received corticosteroids with or without intravenous antiviral agents, and 27 (27%) received only supportive treatment. There was no significant difference in the severity, laboratory findings, or neuroimaging findings between the groups. Significant improvement was observed in 68 (93.2%) and 26 patients (96.3%) in groups 1 and 2, respectively; this rate was not significantly different between the groups (P=0.48). CONCLUSION: Childhood Bell\u2019s palsy showed good prognosis with or without corticosteroid treatment; there was no difference in prognosis between treated and untreated groups.

(2010) Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) during winter influenza season in the southern hemisphere. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 4(4), 187\u2013197. Background Countries in the southern hemisphere experienced sizable epidemics of pandemic influenza H1N1 in their winter season during May\u2013August, 2009. Methods We make use of the Richards model to fit the publicly available epidemic data (confirmed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) of six southern hemisphere countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa) to draw useful conclusions, in terms of its reproduction numbers and outbreak turning points, regarding the new pH1N1 virus in a typical winter influenza season. Results The estimates for the reproduction numbers of these six countries range from a high of 1\u00B753 (95% CI: 1\u00B722, 1\u00B784) for confirmed case data of Brazil to a low of 1\u00B716 (1\u00B709, 1\u00B722) for pH1N1 hospitalizations in Australia. For each country, model fits using confirmed cases, hospitalizations, or deaths data always yield similar estimates for the reproduction number. Moreover, the turning points for these closely related outbreak indicators always follow the correct chronological order, i.e., case\u2013hospitalization\u2013death, whenever two or more of these three indicators are available. Conclusions The results suggest that the winter pH1N1 outbreaks in the southern hemisphere were similar to the earlier spring and later winter outbreaks in North America in its severity and transmissibility, as indicated by the reproduction numbers. Therefore, the current strain has not become more severe or transmissible while circulating around the globe in 2009 as some experts had cautioned. The results will be useful for global preparedness planning of possible tertiary waves of pH1N1 infections in the fall/winter of 2010.","publish_time":"2010-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Ying\u2010Hen","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27274e02683a0348194933d6f5669741346b7113.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6225867.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6225867/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hsieh"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Argentina","Brazil","Chile","Australia","New Zealand","South Africa","North America"],"keyphrases":["winter season","winter pH1N1 outbreaks","typical winter influenza season","southern hemisphere countries","pH1N1 hospitalizations","reproduction numbers","later winter outbreaks","results","confirmed cases","deaths data","confirmed case data of Brazil","new pH1N1 virus","sizable epidemics of pandemic influenza H1N1","available epidemic data","similar estimates","useful conclusions","Australia","Background Countries","turning points","related outbreak indicators","New Zealand","model fits","Richards model","global preparedness planning of possible tertiary waves of pH1N1 infections","earlier spring","North America","Chile","Argentina","South Africa","correct chronological order","terms","severity","transmissibility","country","fall","paper","Hsieh Ying","Hen","CI","globe","current strain","Methods","Respiratory Viruses","experts"],"language":"en"},

In the mouse, only the genes coding for IFN-\u03BB2 and -\u03BB3 are present. Unlike mouse and human type I IFNs (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2), which exhibit strong species specificity, type III IFNs were reported to act in a cross-specific manner. We reexamined the cross-specificity and observed that mouse and human IFN-\u03BB exhibit some species specificity, although much less than type I IFNs. Mouse IFN-\u03BB3 displayed clear species specificity, being 25-fold less active in human cells than the closely related mouse IFN-\u03BB2. This specificity likely depends on amino acids in \u03B1 helices A and F that diverged from other IFN-\u03BB sequences. Human IFN-\u03BB4, in contrast, retained high activity in mouse cells. We next developed a firefly luciferase-based reporter cell line, named Fawa-\u03BB-luc, to detect IFN-\u03BB in biological fluids with high specificity and sensitivity. Fawa-\u03BB-luc cells, derived from mouse epithelial cells that are responsive to IFN-\u03BB, were made nonresponsive to type I IFNs by inactivation of the Ifnar2 gene and strongly responsive to IFN-\u03BB by overexpression of the mouse IFNLR1. This bioassay was as sensitive as a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in detecting mouse IFN-\u03BB in cell culture supernatant, as well as in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples of virus-infected mice. The assay also enabled the sensitive detection of human IFN-\u03BB activity, including that of the divergent IFN-\u03BB4 with a bias, however, due to variable activity of IFN-\u03BB subtypes.","publish_time":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacobs, Sophie; Wavreil, Fanny; Schepens, Bert; Gad, Hans Henrik; Hartmann, Rune; Rocha-Pereira, Joana; Neyts, Johan; Saelens, Xavier; Michiels, Thomas","journal":"J Interferon Cytokine Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7d5b3e78c5c9861e5aca8dd6e7fdbdfbc0172f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6249671.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6249671/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03BB subtypes","IFN-\u03BB sequences","IFN-\u03B1","Mouse IFN-\u03BB3","Human IFN-\u03BB4","related mouse IFN-\u03BB2","Fawa-\u03BB","variable activity of IFN","sensitive detection of human IFN-\u03BB activity","mouse cells","divergent IFN-\u03BB4","mouse IFNLR1","human type","mouse epithelial cells","human cells","high specificity","IFNs","cross-specificity","strong species specificity","clear species specificity","luc cells","high activity","\u03B1 helices","cell culture supernatant","cross-specific manner","available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","firefly luciferase-based reporter cell line","bronchoalveolar lavage samples of virus","biological fluids","contrast","family","serum","Ifnar2 gene","fold","overexpression","infected mice","amino acids","inactivation","sensitivity","bias","genes coding","interferon","bioassay"],"language":"en"},

Evidence shows that LT\u03B2R is involved in various cellular processes; however, whether it plays a role in maintaining the cellular function of intestinal porcine enterocytes (IPEC-J2), specifically during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, remains unknown. In this study, we generated LT\u03B2R null IPEC-J2 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 to examine the importance of LT\u03B2R in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the response to PEDV infection. Our results showed that the lack of LT\u03B2R leads to significantly decreased cell proliferation, potentially due to S phase arrest in LT\u03B2R(\u2212/\u2212) IPEC-J2 cells. Label-free digital holographic microscopy was used to record the three-dimensional morphology of both cell types for up to 72 hours and revealed significantly increased numbers of LT\u03B2R(\u2212/\u2212) cells undergoing apoptosis.

It came as no surprise when viruses were also revealed to transcribe their own lncRNAs. Among them, gammaherpesviruses, one of the three subfamilies of the Herpesviridae, code their largest number. These structurally and functionally intricate non-coding (nc) transcripts modulate cellular and viral gene expression to maintain viral latency or prompt lytic reactivation. These lncRNAs allow for the virus to escape cytosolic surveillance, sequester, and re-localize essential cellular factors and modulate the cell cycle and proliferation. Some viral lncRNAs act as \u201Cmessenger molecules\u201D, transferring information about viral infection to neighboring cells. This broad range of lncRNA functions is achieved through lncRNA structure-mediated interactions with effector molecules of viral and host origin, including other RNAs, proteins and DNAs. In this review, we discuss examples of gammaherpesvirus-encoded lncRNAs, emphasize their unique structural attributes, and link them to viral life cycle, pathogenesis, and disease progression. We will address their potential as novel targets for drug discovery and propose future directions to explore lncRNA structure and function relationship.","publish_time":"2018-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chavez-Calvillo, Gabriela; Martin, Sarah; Hamm, Chad; Sztuba-Solinska, Joanna","journal":"Noncoding RNA","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c92eb9f2f7fd93501102671ee6595e0b157383d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6315926.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral pathogenesis","viral lncRNAs act","viral latency","viral infection","effector molecules of viral","viral life cycle","viral gene expression","encoded lncRNAs","cellular processes","lncRNA structure-mediated interactions","broad range of lncRNA functions","essential cellular factors","intricate non-coding","multitude of long non-coding RNAs","messenger molecules","pleiotropic functions","drug discovery","cell cycle","disease progression","transcripts","future directions","host origin","information","novel targets","prompt lytic reactivation","Herpesviridae","potential","examples of gammaherpesvirus","unique structural attributes","function relationship","subfamilies","largest number","cytosolic surveillance","generation sequencing","proteins","cells","Advances","review","DNAs","proliferation","surprise","gammaherpesviruses"],"language":"en"},

We aim to report the perceptions of a large sample of MHCI workers and government administrators and provide recommendations for developing a national mental health disaster response management plan in China. METHODS: An in-depth qualitative study was conducted, collecting data from 20 focus-group discussions and 25 key stakeholder interviews. These recruited participants who had been involved in different types of disaster rescue across 7 provinces/cities where disasters have recently occurred. We used thematic analysis to analyze the data and relevant findings were extracted for policy recommendation. RESULTS: Mental health workers\u2019 perspectives were examined in detailed according to four core themes: forms of organization, intervention pathway, intervention strategy and technique, and public health information. Post-disaster MHCI should be approached in teams that are integrated with emergency medicine systems, and be led by unified command management. All levels of local health and family planning commission should prepare post-disaster MHCI work plans and build response teams/emergency centres. Future training for MHCI workers should focus on: building a sense of trust within the team; clarifying each member\u2019s role; strengthening the screening, assessment and referrals training for psychological professionals; and providing psychological intervention training for Chinese psychiatrists. It is necessary to set up guiding principles for disaster research ethics, mental health rehabilitation and media interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Through exploring and analyzing the perceptions of current disaster response mental health workers and government administrators, our findings provide essential recommendations for developing a national to county level post-disaster MHCI emergency management plan and can guide the formulation of relevant laws and regulation in China.

Like other RNA viruses with high mutation rates, CHIKV produces populations of genetically diverse genomes within a host. While several known CHIKV mutations influence disease severity in vertebrates and transmission by mosquitoes, the role of intrahost diversity in chikungunya arthritic disease has not been studied. In this study, high- and low-fidelity CHIKV variants, previously characterized by altered in vitro population mutation frequencies, were used to evaluate how intrahost diversity influences clinical disease, CHIKV replication, and antibody neutralization in immunocompetent adult mice inoculated in the rear footpads. Both high- and low-fidelity mutations were hypothesized to attenuate CHIKV arthritic disease, replication, and neutralizing antibody levels compared to wild-type (WT) CHIKV. Unexpectedly, high-fidelity mutants elicited more severe arthritic disease than the WT despite comparable CHIKV replication, whereas a low-fidelity mutant produced attenuated disease and replication. Serum antibody developed against both high- and low-fidelity CHIKV exhibited reduced neutralization of WT CHIKV. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), the high-fidelity mutations were demonstrated to be genetically stable but produced more genetically diverse populations than WT CHIKV in mice. This enhanced diversification was subsequently reproduced after serial in vitro passage. The NGS results contrast with previously reported population diversities for fidelity variants, which focused mainly on part of the E1 gene, and highlight the need for direct measurements of mutation rates to clarify CHIKV fidelity phenotypes. IMPORTANCE CHIKV is a reemerging global health threat that elicits debilitating arthritis in humans. There are currently no commercially available CHIKV vaccines. Like other RNA viruses, CHIKV has a high mutation rate and is capable of rapid intrahost diversification during an infection. In other RNA viruses, virus population diversity associates with disease progression; however, potential impacts of intrahost viral diversity on CHIKV arthritic disease have not been studied. Using previously characterized CHIKV fidelity variants, we addressed whether CHIKV population diversity influences the severity of arthritis and host antibody response in an arthritic mouse model. Our findings show that CHIKV populations with greater genetic diversity can cause more severe disease and stimulate antibody responses with reduced neutralization of low-diversity virus populations in vitro. The discordant high-fidelity phenotypes in this study highlight the complexity of inferring replication fidelity indirectly from population diversity.","publish_time":"2019-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Riemersma, Kasen K.; Steiner, Cody; Singapuri, Anil; Coffey, Lark L.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ed4c31d7ee724f9937c3f91d2a91b01579a853c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6340026.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6340026/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS","CHIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHIKV populations","CHIKV arthritic disease","CHIKV population diversity","IMPORTANCE CHIKV","CHIKV fidelity phenotypes","low-fidelity CHIKV variants","comparable CHIKV replication","characterized CHIKV fidelity variants","reduced neutralization of WT CHIKV","available CHIKV vaccines","known CHIKV mutations influence disease severity","severe disease","severe arthritic disease","chikungunya arthritic disease","low-fidelity mutations","disease progression","attenuated disease","clinical disease","diversity virus populations","low-fidelity mutant","role of intrahost diversity","virus population diversity associates","antibody neutralization","complexity of inferring replication fidelity","high mutation rates","reduced neutralization of low","greater genetic diversity","population mutation frequencies","potential impacts of intrahost viral diversity","antibody responses","Serum antibody","diverse populations","RNA viruses","high-fidelity mutations","host antibody response","severity of arthritis","debilitating arthritis","Chikungunya virus","neutralizing antibody levels","reported population diversities","arthritic mouse model","reemerging global health threat","direct measurements of mutation rates","capable of rapid intrahost diversification","study","discordant high-fidelity phenotypes","high-fidelity mutants","diverse genomes","enhanced diversification","immunocompetent adult mice","NGS results contrast","vertebrates","need","transmission","mosquitoes","wild-type","rear footpads","serial","infection","people","humans","findings","generation sequencing","E1 gene","passage"],"language":"en"},

This study interviewed pig traders operating at Uganda\u2019s only registered pork abattoir to describe their characteristics, business practices, biosecurity practices, and pig health management and reporting practices. All the traders were male, and nearly all (90.5%) relied on pig trading as their primary source of income. Most of the pigs brought for processing at the slaughterhouse were purchased from smallholder farms (87.3%). In addition, there was a significant difference in the high price paid per kilogram at farm gate by region (P = 0.005). High prices paid at farm gate were associated with holiday periods (P \u003C 0.001), harvest season (P \u003C 0.001), and drought (P \u003C 0.001). Traders preferred buying live pigs from male farmers (88.9%) because they were considered the final decision makers and owned the pigs being sold.

This cell line consists predominantly of fibroblast-like cells, and can grow at 15\u201337\u00B0C under an optimum temperature of 26\u00B0C. The origin of this cell line was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and 18s recombinant (r)RNA sequencing. The chromosome analysis of EK cells at passage 58 revealed an ananeuploid karyotype. The EK cells were successfully transfected with the Pegfp-N1 plasmid, suggesting its potential in genetic studies. The susceptibility test showed a significant cytopathic effect (CPE) in EK cells for Rana grylio virus, and the viral replication was evidenced with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. After poly (I:C) stimulation, the expression of the immune-related molecules including interferon regulatory factor-3 (irf3), interferon regulatory factor-7 (irf7) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) were significantly upregulated in EK cells, while the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03B2) was downregulated. These results suggested the potential of EK cell line as a model in gene engineering, virus identification and environmental toxicology.","publish_time":"2018-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Bin; Zheng, Zaiyu; Yang, Jinxian; Chi, Hongshu; Huang, He; Gong, Hui","journal":"Biol Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24db4d088787fb5c43f2f60604e1f1463d4b4082.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6361207.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6361207/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","EK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential of EK cell line","new cell line","chromosome analysis of EK cells","interferon regulatory factor","qRT-PCR","Anguilla anguilla","eel kidney","expression of transforming growth factor","quantitative real-time PCR","kidney of European eel","virus identification","Rana grylio virus","amplification","gene engineering","model","s recombinant","viral replication","significant cytopathic effect","irf7","immune-related molecules","passage","CPE","irf3","polymerase chain reaction","environmental toxicology","TGF-\u03B2","fetal bovine serum","RNA sequencing","susceptibility test","stimulation","CYP450","Pegfp-N1 plasmid","months","cytochrome P450","assay","origin","results","fibroblast","optimum temperature","genetic studies","ananeuploid karyotype","Leibovitz\u0027s","times"],"language":"en"},

Besides the consensus that spontaneous conversion of normal cellular PrP(C) into misfolded and aggregating PrP(Sc) is the central event in prion disease, an alternative hypothesis suggests the generation of pathological PrP(Sc) by rare translational frameshifting events in the octa-repeat domain of the PrP mRNA. Ribosomal frameshifting most commonly relies on a slippery site and an adjacent stable RNA structure to stall translating ribosome. Hence, it is crucial to unravel the secondary structure of the octa-repeat domain of PrP mRNA. Each of the five octa-repeats contains a motif (GGCGGUGGUGGCUGGG) which alone in vitro forms a G-quadruplex. Since the propensity of mRNA to form secondary structure depends on the sequence context, we set to determine the structure of the complete octa-repeat region. We assessed the structure of full-length octa-repeat domain of PrP mRNA using dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and selective 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analysis by primer extension (SHAPE).

A rapid and accurate diagnosis is important for early treatment for reducing the duration of infection as well as for preventing further potential health complications. In this work, we have developed a novel colorimetric molecular assay that integrates nucleic acid analysis by dynamic chemistry (ChemNAT) with reverse dot-blot hybridization in an array format for a rapid and easy discrimination of Leishmania major and Trypanosoma cruzi. The assay consists of a singleplex PCR step that amplifies a highly homologous DNA sequence which encodes for the RNA component of the large ribosome subunit. The amplicons of the two different parasites differ between them by single nucleotide variations, known as \u201CSingle Nucleotide Fingerprint\u201D (SNF) markers. The SNF markers can be easily identified by naked eye using a novel micro Spin-Tube device \u0022Spin-Tube\u0022, as each of them creates a specific spot pattern. Moreover, the direct use of ribosomal RNA without requiring the PCR pre-amplification step is also feasible, further increasing the simplicity of the assay. The molecular assay delivers sensitivity capable of identifying up to 8.7 copies per \u00B5L with single mismatch specificity. The Spin-Tube thus represents an innovative solution providing benefits in terms of time, cost, and simplicity, all of which are crucial for the diagnosis of infectious disease in developing countries.","publish_time":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tabraue-Ch\u00E1vez, Mavys; Luque-Gonz\u00E1lez, Mar\u00EDa Ang\u00E9lica; Mar\u00EDn-Romero, Antonio; S\u00E1nchez-Mart\u00EDn, Rosario Mar\u00EDa; Escobedo-Araque, Pablo; Pernagallo, Salvatore; D\u00EDaz-Moch\u00F3n, Juan Jos\u00E9","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ffacbedf65fc0a9fe529e94b43fc3e9018775f6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6403333.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6403333/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Trypanosoma"],"organizations":["SNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developed countries","novel colorimetric molecular assay","novel micro Spin-Tube device","Single Nucleotide Fingerprint","single nucleotide variations","developing countries","simplicity","SNF markers","diagnosis of infectious disease","singleplex PCR step","single mismatch specificity","RNA component","accurate diagnosis","PCR pre-amplification step","Chagas disease","direct use of ribosomal RNA","nucleic acid analysis","ChemNAT","dynamic chemistry","easy discrimination of Leishmania major","array format","reverse dot-blot hybridization","early treatment","benefits","terms of time","copies","innovative solution","Trypanosoma cruzi","naked eye","cost","large ribosome subunit","\u00B5L","homologous DNA sequence","different parasites","sensitivity capable","Leishmaniasis","duration of infection","potential health complications","specific spot pattern","amplicons","work"],"language":"en"},

The VAA protein previously identified in flounder is associated with a role in immune protection within these fish. In the present study, a recombinant DNA plasmid encoding the VAA gene of V. anguillarum was constructed and its potential as a DNA vaccine, to prevent the infection of V. anguillarum in flounder fish, investigated. We verified the expression of the VAA protein both in vitro in cell lines and in vivo in flounder fish. The protective effects of pcDNA3.1-VAA (pVAA) were analyzed by determination of the percentage of sIgM(\u002B), CD4-1(\u002B), CD4-2(\u002B), CD8\u03B2(\u002B) lymphocytes, and the production of VAA-specific antibodies in flounder following their immunization with the DNA vaccine. Histopathological changes in immune related tissues, bacterial load, and relative percentage survival rates of flounder post-challenge with V. anguillarum, were all investigated to assess the efficacy of the pVAA DNA vaccine candidate. Fish intramuscularly immunized with pVAA showed a significant increase in CD4-1(\u002B), CD4-2(\u002B), and CD8\u03B2(\u002B) T lymphocytes at days 9, 11, and 14 post-vaccination, reaching peak T-cell levels at days 11 or 14 post-immunization. The percentage of sIgM(\u002B) lymphocytes reached peak levels at weeks 4\u20135 post-immunization. Specific anti-V. anguillarum or anti-rVAA antibodies were induced in inoculated fish at days 28\u201335 post-immunization. The liver of vaccinated flounder exhibited only slight histopathological changes compared with a significant pathology observed in control immunized fish. Additionally, a lower bacterial burden in the liver, spleen, and kidney were observed in pVAA protected fish in response to bacterial challenge, compared with pcDNA3.1 vector control injected fish. Moreover, the pVAA vaccine confers a relative percentage survival of 50.00% following V. anguillarum infection. In summary, this is the first study indicating an initial induction of the T lymphocyte response, followed by B lymphocyte induction of specific antibodies as a result of DNA immunization of flounder. This signifies the important potential of pVAA as a DNA vaccine candidate for the control of V. anguillarum infection.","publish_time":"2019-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xing, Jing; Xu, Hongsen; Tang, Xiaoqian; Sheng, Xiuzhen; Zhan, Wenbin","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1cb9713cb3f669a5f4b63e04395fb4669312d5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6435001.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6435001/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VAA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["flounder fish","pVAA vaccine","result of DNA immunization of flounder","post-immunization","anguillarum infection","pVAA DNA vaccine candidate","inoculated fish","control immunized fish","Vibrio anguillarum","CD4","liver of vaccinated flounder","VAA protein","relative percentage survival rates of flounder post-challenge","vector control injected fish","days","control of","T lymphocytes","post-vaccination","VAA gene of","production of VAA","important potential of pVAA","percentage of sIgM","infection of","recombinant DNA plasmid","bacterial challenge","T lymphocyte response","peak T-cell levels","B lymphocyte induction of specific antibodies","bacterial load","anti-rVAA antibodies","significant pathology","significant losses","peak levels","significant increase","CD8\u03B2","slight histopathological changes","lower bacterial burden","initial induction","cell lines","immune protection","present study","immune related tissues","protective effects of pcDNA3","weeks","pathogenic bacterium","spleen","kidney","role","efficacy","aquaculture industry","determination","expression","summary"],"language":"en"},

Compared to other Fox proteins, they can form domain-swapped dimers through their DNA-binding \u2013forkhead\u2013 domains, enabling spatial reorganization of distant chromosome elements by tethering two DNA molecules together. Yet, domain swapping stability and DNA binding affinity varies between different FoxP proteins. Experimental evidence suggests that the protonation state of a histidine residue conserved in all Fox proteins is responsible for pH-dependent modulation of these interactions. Here, we explore the consequences of the protonation state of another histidine (H59), only conserved within FoxM/O/P subfamilies, on folding and dimerization of the forkhead domain of human FoxP1. Dimer dissociation kinetics and equilibrium unfolding experiments demonstrate that protonation of H59 leads to destabilization of the domain-swapped dimer due to an increase in free energy difference between the monomeric and transition states. This pH\u2013dependence is abolished when H59 is mutated to alanine. Furthermore, anisotropy measurements and molecular dynamics evidence that H59 has a direct impact in the local stability of helix H3. Altogether, our results highlight the relevance of H59 in domain swapping and folding stability of FoxP1.","publish_time":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Medina, Exequiel; Villalobos, Pablo; Co\u00F1uecar, Ricardo; Ram\u00EDrez-Sarmiento, C\u00E9sar A.; Babul, Jorge","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6ffbfa9a7a61fc231df2d34690da73211365c18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6443806.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6443806/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Forkhead box P","FoxM/O/P"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protonation of H59","Fox proteins","relevance of H59","forkhead domain of human FoxP1","domain-swapped dimers","DNA-binding","protonation state","different FoxP proteins","folding stability of FoxP1","DNA binding affinity","DNA molecules","Forkhead box P","versatile Fox transcription factors","P subfamilies","Experimental evidence","histidine residue","local stability of helix H3","molecular dynamics evidence","Dimer dissociation kinetics","pH-dependent modulation","members","spatial reorganization of distant chromosome elements","domains","experiments","direct impact","expression of multiple genes","free energy difference","timing","increase","equilibrium","dimerization","eukaryotic cell homeostasis","destabilization","anisotropy measurements","FoxM","transition states","interactions","results","consequences","dependence","alanine"],"language":"en"},

Recovery of concentrated, high quality pathogen nucleic acid (NA) from complex specimen matrices is required for optimal performance of several NA amplification/detection technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fully integrated NAAT platforms that enable rapid sample-to-result workflows with minimal user input are generally restricted to larger reference lab settings, and their complexity and cost are prohibitive to widespread implementation in resource limited settings (RLS). Identification of component technologies for incorporation of reliable and affordable sample preparation with pathogen NA amplification/detection into an integrated platform suitable for RLS, is a necessary first step toward achieving the overarching goal of reducing infectious disease-associated morbidity and mortality globally. In the current study, we evaluate the performance of six novel NA extraction technologies from different developers using blinded panels of stool, sputum and blood spiked with variable amounts of quality-controlled DNA- and/or RNA-based microbes. The extraction efficiencies were semi-quantitatively assessed using validated real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays specific for each microbe and comparing target-specific RT-PCR results to those obtained with reference NA extraction methods. The technologies were ranked based on overall diagnostic accuracy (analytical sensitivity and specificity). Sample input and output volumes, total processing time, user-required manual steps and cost estimates were also examined for suitability in RLS. Together with the performance analysis, these metrics were used to select the more suitable candidate technologies for further optimization of integrated NA amplification and detection technologies for RLS.","publish_time":"2019-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beall, Shivani G.; Cantera, Jason; Diaz, Maureen H.; Winchell, Jonas M.; Lillis, Lorraine; White, Heather; Kalnoky, Michael; Gallarda, James; Boyle, David S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dbbf1b6713b9819bbe78a272e728951afa62ef95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6472818.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6472818/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA","RLS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection technologies","novel NA extraction technologies","pathogen NA amplification","RLS","optimization of integrated NA amplification","suitable candidate technologies","reference NA extraction methods","Infectious disease nucleic acid amplification technologies","Identification of component technologies","Sample input","rapid sample","rapid time","integrated NAAT platforms","optimal performance","PCR assays specific","integrated platform suitable","specificity","performance analysis","extraction efficiencies","high quality pathogen nucleic acid","target-specific RT-PCR results","affordable sample preparation","minimal user input","infectious disease-associated morbidity","superior sensitivity","analytical sensitivity","larger reference lab settings","cost estimates","result workflows","total processing time","variable amounts of quality","resource limited settings","RNA-based microbes","traditional microbiological methods","different developers","widespread implementation","incorporation of reliable","blinded panels of stool","output volumes","sputum","blood","complexity","validated real-time reverse transcription","complex specimen matrices","manual steps","diagnostic accuracy","polymerase chain reaction","controlled DNA","overarching goal","Recovery of concentrated","mortality","suitability","current study","metrics"],"language":"en"},

Gene expression of 110 manually selected genes in acute, subacute and chronic lesions was analyzed using pre-existing microarray data. Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3, IRF7, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, STAT2, MX protein, protein kinase R (PKR), 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) 1 and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 expression were also evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Cellular origin of STAT1, STAT2, MX and PKR were determined using immunofluorescence. CDV infection caused an increased expression of the antiviral effector proteins MX, PKR, OAS1 and ISG15, which probably contributed to a restricted viral replication, particularly in neurons and oligodendrocytes. This increase might be partly mediated by IRF-dependent pathways due to the lack of changes in IFN-I levels and absence of STAT2 in astrocytes. Nevertheless, activated microglia/macrophages showed a strong expression of STAT1, STAT2 and MX proteins in later stages of the disease, indicating a strong activation of the IFN-I signaling cascade, which might be involved in the aggravation of bystander demyelination.","publish_time":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klotz, Daniela; Gerhauser, Ingo","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85657444327cc8301d257fbda39df1a02e9d1d40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6480560.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6480560/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OAS","ISG","MX","CDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Gene expression","MX proteins","increased expression","expression of type","strong expression of STAT1","PKR","IFN","absence of STAT2","antiviral effector proteins MX","CDV infection","interferon-stimulated gene","Interferon regulatory factor","chronic lesions","cerebellar lesions","strong activation","protein kinase R","Cellular origin of STAT1","IRF-dependent pathways","leukoencephalitis","translational animal model","signal transducer","insight","activator of transcription","IRF7","disease","genes","pathway members","OAS1","later stages","demyelinating canine distemper virus","neurons","multiple sclerosis","macrophages","pre-existing microarray data","lack of changes","restricted viral replication","role","lesion development","present study","microglia","ISG15","oligoadenylate synthetase","aggravation of bystander demyelination","oligodendrocytes","astrocytes","immunofluorescence","cascade","immunohistochemistry"],"language":"en"},

The Egyptian rousette bat (ERB) is a natural reservoir host for the marburgviruses and evidence suggests that bats are also natural reservoirs for the ebolaviruses. Although the search for the natural reservoirs of the ebolaviruses has largely involved serosurveillance of the bat population, there are no validated serological assays to screen bat sera for ebolavirus-specific IgG antibodies. Here, we generate filovirus-specific antisera by prime-boost immunization of groups of captive ERBs with all seven known culturable filoviruses. After validating a system of filovirus-specific indirect ELISAs utilizing infectious-based virus antigens for detection of virus-specific IgG antibodies from bat sera, we assess the level of serological cross-reactivity between the virus-specific antisera and heterologous filovirus antigens. This data is then used to generate a filovirus antibody fingerprint that can predict which of the filovirus species in the system is most antigenically similar to the species responsible for past infection. Our filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system will be a critical tool for identifying bat species with high ebolavirus seroprevalence rates to target for longitudinal studies aimed at establishing natural reservoir host-ebolavirus relationships.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schuh, Amy J.; Amman, Brian R.; Sealy, Tara S.; Flietstra, Timothy D.; Guito, Jonathan C.; Nichol, Stuart T.; Towner, Jonathan S.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9683ced158e728a9be859ddbeaf2930584e4dea8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6491471.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491471/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["sub-Saharan Africa"],"keyphrases":["filovirus species","system of filovirus","filovirus-specific antisera","bat species","ebolavirus-specific IgG antibodies","bat population","filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system","heterologous filovirus antigens","ebolaviruses","natural reservoirs","specific indirect ELISAs","screen bat sera","filovirus antibody fingerprint","natural reservoir host-ebolavirus relationships","Egyptian rousette bat","detection of virus","marburgviruses","species responsible","infectious-based virus antigens","high ebolavirus seroprevalence rates","validated serological assays","level of serological cross-reactivity","cause outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever","captive ERBs","family Filoviridae","prime-boost immunization of groups","longitudinal studies","critical tool","Bombali viruses","evidence","sub-Saharan Africa","bats","known culturable filoviruses","exception of Reston","past infection","serosurveillance","search","data"],"language":"en"},

The main goal of aging research is to find therapies that attenuate aging and alleviate aging-related diseases. In this study, we screened a natural product library for geroprotective compounds using Werner syndrome (WS) human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), a premature aging model that we recently established. Ten candidate compounds were identified and quercetin was investigated in detail due to its leading effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that quercetin alleviated senescence via the enhancement of cell proliferation and restoration of heterochromatin architecture in WS hMSCs. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the transcriptional commonalities and differences in the geroprotective effects by quercetin and Vitamin C. Besides WS hMSCs, quercetin also attenuated cellular senescence in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and physiological-aging hMSCs. Taken together, our study identifies quercetin as a geroprotective agent against accelerated and natural aging in hMSCs, providing a potential therapeutic intervention for treating age-associated disorders.

This raises the question whether bats are the only sources of human infection. In this study, we screened 517 cynomolgus macaques caught in Singapore for evidence of exposure to PRV3M (also known as Melaka virus), which was first isolated from human patients in Melaka, Malaysia. We found that 67 serum samples were PRV3M positive by ELISA and 34 were also positive by virus neutralization assay. To investigate whether monkeys could act as hosts for PRV transmission, we experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques with PRV3M and housed these animals with uninfected monkeys. Although no clinical signs of infection were observed in infected animals, viral RNA was detected in nasal and rectal swabs and all infected macaques seroconverted. Additionally, one of the uninfected animals seroconverted, implying active shedding and transmission of PRV3M.

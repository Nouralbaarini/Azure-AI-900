From transcription to decay, cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs) associate with specific proteins in order to regulate their entire cycle, including mRNA localization, translation and degradation, among others. The best characterized of such RNA-protein complexes, today named membraneless organelles, are Stress Granules (SGs) and Processing Bodies (PBs) which are involved in RNA storage and RNA decay/storage, respectively. Given that SGs and PBs are generally associated with repression of gene expression, viruses have evolved different mechanisms to counteract their assembly or to use them in their favor to successfully replicate within the host environment. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about the viral regulation of SGs and PBs, which could be a potential novel target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.","publish_time":"2019-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaete-Argel, Aracelly; M\u00E1rquez, Chantal L.; Barriga, Gonzalo P.; Soto-Rifo, Ricardo; Valiente-Echeverr\u00EDa, Fernando","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc212dc72c96fcedc6e724394fe67ff77087a5d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6797609.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681621/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2019.00336","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA storage","PBs","RNA decay","Regulation of RNA homeostasis","RNA-protein complexes","viral regulation of SGs","eukaryotic gene expression","repression of gene expression","associate","mRNAs","membraneless organelles","Stress Granules","cellular messenger RNAs","mRNA localization","entire cycle","order","specific proteins","viruses","central step","RNAstasis","development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies","different mechanisms","current knowledge","Processing Bodies","potential novel target","translation","degradation","transcription","assembly","review","best","host environment"],"language":"en"},

These proteins are ubiquitin-like proteins that become directly conjugated to a lipid in the autophagy membrane upon induction of autophagy, thus providing a marker of the pathway, allowing studies of autophagosome biogenesis and maturation. Moreover, the ATG8 proteins function to recruit components of the core autophagy machinery as well as cargo for selective degradation. Importantly, comprehensive structural and biochemical in vitro studies of the machinery required for ATG8 protein lipidation, as well as their genetic manipulation in various model organisms, have provided novel insight into the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiological roles of the mATG8 proteins.

We use a mathematical model to study the dynamics of viral coinfection of the respiratory tract in an effort to understand the kinetics of these infections. Specifically, we use our model to investigate coinfections of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, and human metapneumovirus. Our study shows that during coinfections, one virus can block another simply by being the first to infect the available host cells; there is no need for viral interference through immune response interactions. We use the model to calculate the duration of detectable coinfection and examine how it varies as initial viral dose and time of infection are varied. We find that rhinovirus, the fastest-growing virus, reduces replication of the remaining viruses during a coinfection, while parainfluenza virus, the slowest-growing virus is suppressed in the presence of other viruses.","publish_time":"2016-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinky, Lubna; Dobrovolny, Hana M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a851d4005336287cd41901a8fcd0ba3bab686c9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4873262.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27196110/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155589","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parainfluenza virus","respiratory syncytial virus","single virus infections","slowest-growing virus","respiratory tract","dynamics of viral coinfection","viral interference","rhinovirus","remaining viruses","mathematical model","study","initial viral dose","duration of detectable coinfection","coinfections of influenza","time of infection","simultaneous infection","need","immune response interactions","replication","hospitalized patients","human metapneumovirus","effort","presence","available host cells","Studies","kinetics"],"language":"en"},

Interaction of the viral spike (S) surface glycoprotein with the host cell receptor is recognized as the first step of infection and is the main determinant of virus tropism. The mechanisms by which neutralizing antibodies inhibit PEDV have not been defined. Isolating PEDV neutralizing antibodies are crucial to identifying the receptor-binding domains of the viral spike and elucidating the mechanism of protection against PEDV infection. METHODS: B cell hybridoma technique was used to generate hybridoma cells that secrete specific antibodies. E.coli prokaryotic expression system and Bac-to-Bac expression system were used to identify the target protein of each monoclonal antibody. qPCR was performed to analyze PEDV binding to Vero E6 cells with neutralizing antibody. RESULTS: We identified 10 monoclonal antibodies using hybridoma technology. Remarkably, 4 mAbs (designed 2G8, 2B11, 3D9, 1E3) neutralized virus infection potently, of which 2B11 and 1E3 targeted the conformational epitope of the PEDV S protein. qPCR results showed that both 2B11 and 2G8 blocked virus entry into Vero cells. CONCLUSION: The data suggested that PEDV neutralizing antibody inhibited virus infection by binding to infectious virions, which could work as a tool to find the receptor-binding domains.

We investigated whether the introduction of the GB program affected prescriptions for second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) for schizophrenic outpatients in public and private medical and psychiatric centers. Methods The prescription data of schizophrenic outpatients treated between 2001 and 2004 were retrieved from the TBNHI database, which included outpatients who were diagnosed as having schizophrenia during the period from 1996 to 2001. Because the new health insurance policy may have had a lag effect on physicians\u0027 decision regarding SGA prescription, we used January 2004 as the timepoint to divide the data, which was 6 months after GB implementation. Thus, data from the 6-month period immediately after the GB implementation were included in the pre-GB period. Second-generation antipsychotics included in the study were clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, zotepin, and amisulpride. Results After January 2004, the proportion of SGA use in outpatient departments did not show an upward trend, as had been observed in the pre-GB period, which appeared at a staggering pace lasting for 12 months (p = 0.0004). Compared with medical centers, SGA expenditures in the psychiatric centers were less affected in the GB period (p \u003C 0.0001). Compared to the private sector, the SGA expenditures in the public sector were less affected in the GB period (p \u003C 0.019). Conclusion We concluded that the GB implementation reduced SGA expenditures significantly. The extent of influence varied among hospitals (i.e., public versus private, medical versus psychiatric centers), which was most likely caused by financial factors.","publish_time":"2014-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiu, Hsien-Jane; Chou, Po-Han; Loh, El-Wui; Lan, Tzuo-Yun; Wu, Bo-Jian; Chang, Yung-Yan; Liu, Shuen-Zen; Lan, Tsuo-Hung","journal":"Journal of the Chinese Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e98e2ac0dd1a270840218c14aadd596cbb3d69d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105039.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcma.2014.03.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1726490114000781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863739/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1726490114000781","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SGA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GB implementation","pre-GB period","GB program","SGA expenditures","medical centers","SGA prescription","psychiatric centers","month period","public sector","private sector","prescription data of schizophrenic outpatients","proportion of SGA use","second-generation antipsychotics","months","rising costs of medical care","new health insurance policy","TBNHI database","Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance","olanzapine","lag effect","prescriptions","SGAs","outpatient departments","global budget","ziprasidone","quetiapine","risperidone","clozapine","study","physicians\u0027 decision","zotepin","hospitals","Methods","Abstract Background","staggering pace","introduction","upward trend","extent of influence","amisulpride","schizophrenia","Conclusion","financial factors","Results","timepoint"],"language":"en"},

Increased cellular autophagy may kill the infected cell and terminate the infection without proper regulation. The mechanism of autophagy regulation during liver disease progression in HCV infection is unclear. The autophagy research has gained a lot of attention recently since autophagy impairment is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) are three autophagy processes involved in the lysosomal degradation and extracellular release of cytosolic cargoes under excessive stress. Autophagy processes compensate for each other during extreme endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to promote host and microbe survival as well as HCC development in the highly stressed microenvironment of the cirrhotic liver. This review describes the molecular details of how excessive cellular stress generated during HCV infection activates CMA to improve cell survival. The pathological implications of stress-related CMA activation resulting in the loss of hepatic innate immunity and tumor suppressors, which are most often observed among cirrhotic patients with HCC, are discussed. The oncogenic cell programming through autophagy regulation initiated by a cytoplasmic virus may facilitate our understanding of HCC mechanisms related to non-viral etiologies and metabolic conditions such as uncontrolled type II diabetes. We propose that a better understanding of how excessive cellular stress leads to cancer through autophagy modulation may allow therapeutic development and early detection of HCC.","publish_time":"2019-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dash, Srikanta; Aydin, Yucel; Moroz, Krzysztof","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/913eec76aeacee7ccd5410fba9916a25c8491ef8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6912708.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells8111308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652893/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCC","HCV","CMA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular autophagy","autophagy modulation","autophagy impairment","autophagy research","mechanism of autophagy regulation","infection triggers autophagy processes","excessive stress","excessive cellular stress","HCC development","chaperone-mediated autophagy","HCV infection","understanding of HCC mechanisms","cellular components","cell survival","pathological implications of stress","early detection of HCC","therapeutic development","related CMA activation","proper regulation","cytoplasmic virus","infected cell","cirrhotic liver","virus replication","development of hepatocellular carcinoma","Hepatitis C virus","oncogenic cell programming","better understanding","microbe survival","cirrhotic patients","liver disease progression","non-viral etiologies","metabolic conditions","extracellular release of cytosolic cargoes","lysosomal degradation","loss of hepatic innate immunity","cancer","extreme endoplasmic reticulum","molecular details","stressed microenvironment","tumor suppressors","uncontrolled type","lot of attention","microautophagy","host","diabetes","Macroautophagy","review"],"language":"en"},

Biological filtration method of disinfection is the key step in centralized multistep and decentralized point-of-use water treatment system. A biofilm of indigenous microorganisms fixed on solid surface, called biofilter, is an eco-friendly and economic technique for removal of pollutants and pathogens. Stone, gravel, sand, soil, compost, mesoporous mineral stone, wood chips, etc., exemplify solid bed medium which provide enhanced surface area for microbial adherence and water retention. Slow sand filter (SSF) characterized by slow flow rate (0.1\u20130.2m3/h) and a biological layer over filter bed called schmutzdecke is fairly efficient in removal of coliform microorganisms such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, total coliform and fecal coliform, fecal streptococci, bacteriophage, and MS2 virus from wastewater. Rapid sand filter characterized by coarser sand and higher flow rate than SSF removes indicator microorganisms efficiently. Stormwater biofilter is popular and effective method for removal of pathogen and involves biological activity and physical retention of pathogen on filter media. Microbial diversity, inoculum size, pH and moisture of medium, temperature, and nutrient content are key parameters governing optimum performance of biofilter system. Therefore, biofiltration can be an efficient bioremediation technology for pathogen removal.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maurya, Anurag; Singh, Manoj Kumar; Kumar, Sushil","journal":"Waterborne Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5164ce1de0ee4b2ad9e899d990c1ad9c4513a46d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153332.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128187838000074; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128187838000074","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["removal of pathogen","pathogen removal","removal of coliform microorganisms","Slow sand filter","filter bed","Rapid sand filter","fecal coliform","coarser sand","water retention","removal of pollutants","filter media","total coliform","SSF","solid surface","solid bed medium","physical retention of pathogen","biological activity","biological layer","slow flow rate","indicator microorganisms","Stormwater biofilter","water treatment system","Biological filtration method of disinfection","optimum performance of biofilter system","higher flow rate","ingestion of contaminated water","biofilm of indigenous microorganisms","fecal streptococci","key step","key parameters","effective method","moisture of medium","microbial adherence","Microbial diversity","MS2 virus","enhanced surface area","mesoporous mineral stone","efficient bioremediation technology","compost","Escherichia coli","soil","bacteriophage","nutrient content","Salmonella","decentralized point","temperature","wood chips","Cryptosporidium","Giardia","schmutzdecke","inoculum size","human community"],"language":"en"},

It was noted that in cells infected with coronavirus, transcription and translation of some of these genes were differentially induced. Drastic induction of their expression at the transcriptional level was observed in cells infected with coronavirus. However, induction of the same genes at the translational level was usually found to be minimal to moderate. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using SARS-CoV proteins as baits, revealing that a subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), eIF3f, may interact with the N-terminal region of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. Meanwhile, parallel experiments confirmed that eIF3f could also interact with the S protein of another coronavirus, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). These interactions led to the inhibition of translation of a reporter gene in both in vitro expression system and intact cells. Interestingly, IBV-infected cells stably expressing a Flag-tagged eIF3f showed much higher translation of IL-6 and IL-8, suggesting that the interaction between coronavirus S protein and eIF3f plays a functional role in controlling the expression of host genes, especially genes that are induced during coronavirus infection cycles. This study reveals a novel mechanism exploited by coronavirus to regulate viral pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2008-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Han; Xu, Ling Hui; Yamada, Yoshiyuki; Liu, Ding Xiang","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5abea4a5497c9cfa476bf766b8360f73c12e8122.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2204050.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18231581/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001494","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus S protein","eIF3f","expression of host genes","coronavirus infection cycles","expression of numerous host genes","IBV-infected cells","expression system","intact cells","avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","inhibition of translation","viral infection","higher translation of IL","transcriptional level","SARS-CoV spike","SARS-CoV proteins","viral pathogenesis","translational levels","Drastic induction","reporter gene","functional role","hybrid screen","eukaryotic initiation factor","N-terminal region","yeast","subunit","co-immunoprecipitation","baits","Flag","number of proinflammatory cytokines","underlying mechanisms","novel mechanism","immunofluorescent staining","chemokines","response","study","interactions","parallel experiments"],"language":"en"},

PDCoV causes acute diarrhea and vomiting in pigs, resulting in significant economic losses in the global pork industry. In this study, a Chinese PDCoV strain, designated CHN-HG-2017, was isolated from feces of a suckling piglet with severe watery diarrhea on a farm located in central China. Subsequently, the virus was identified by an indirect immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. A nucleotide sequence alignment showed that the whole genome of CHN-HG-2017 is 97.6%-99.1% identical to other PDCoV strains. Analysis of potential recombination sites showed that CHN-HG-2017 is a possible recombinant originating from the strains CH/SXD1/2015 and Vietnam/HaNoi6/2015. Furthermore, the pathogenicity of this recombinant PDCoV strain was investigated in 5-day-old piglets by oral inoculation. The challenged piglets developed typical symptoms, such as vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea and lethargy, from 1 to 7 days post-inoculation (DPI). Viral shedding was detected in rectal swabs until 14 DPI in the challenged piglets. Interestingly, high titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies in sera were detected at 21 DPI. Tissues of small intestines from CHN-HG-2017-infected piglets at 4 DPI displayed significant macroscopic and microscopic lesions with clear viral antigen expression. Our analysis of the full genome sequence of a recombinant PDCoV and its virulence in suckling piglets might provide new insights into the pathogenesis of PDCoV and facilitate further investigation of this newly emerged pathogen.","publish_time":"2018-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Meng-Jia; Liu, De-Jian; Liu, Xiao-Li; Ge, Xing-Yi; Jongkaewwattana, Anan; He, Qi-Gai; Luo, Rui","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6037a68877de95ae30afe19d82228d12a3b81f5b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087286.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-4081-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30377826/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DPI"],"locations":["Hong Kong","China"],"keyphrases":["PDCoV strains","recombinant PDCoV strain","pathogenesis of PDCoV","suckling piglets","challenged piglets","Chinese PDCoV strain","designated CHN-HG","genome of CHN","day-old piglets","infected piglets","genome sequence","acute diarrhea","possible recombinant originating","severe watery diarrhea","strains CH","Viral shedding","oral inoculation","significant economic losses","high titers of virus","nucleotide sequence alignment","days post-inoculation","clear viral antigen expression","Analysis of potential recombination sites","microscopic lesions","new insights","SXD1","farm","pigs","virulence","indirect immunofluorescence assay","global pork industry","electron microscopy","antibodies","investigation","Tissues of small intestines","rectal swabs","typical symptoms","Vietnam","feces","lethargy","anorexia","study","pathogenicity","central China","emerged pathogen","HaNoi6","sera","Porcine deltacoronavirus","Hong Kong","countries","world"],"language":"en"},

The assay utilized primers targeting ISAV RNA segment 8, with ISAV isolate U5575-1 as template. The entire optimized assay, including one cycle of reverse transcription, 50 cycles of complementary DNA amplification, and data acquisition and analysis took only 80 min. The melting curve and gel electrophoresis analyses of real-time RT\u2013PCR showed harmony with each other as a virus-specific single melting peak and a product of the expected size of 211 bp were obtained. A regression line between the mean threshold cycle (Ct) values and viral template concentrations over a 1:10(5) dilution range with an r(2) value of 0.962 and a slope of \u22123.771 indicated that the assay was highly reproducible. This assay was 100 times more sensitive than the conventional one-tube RT\u2013PCR assay when compared on the same sample. Analysis of different tissues from fish that survived an ISAV experimental infection further confirmed that real-time RT\u2013PCR was more sensitive than regular RT\u2013PCR for detection of ISAV nucleic acids. Temporal analysis of ISAV-infected TO cell cultures showed that the amount of the specific viral RNA increased more than 100-fold within 32 h post-inoculation (p.i.) and over 1200-fold by 144 h p.i. The melting curve analysis throughout the duration of the infection sampled had a single melting peak suggesting that the virus population was uniform in the targeted region. Quantitative analysis of CHSE-214 cell cultures infected with different ISAV isolates indicated that ISAV isolates, based on their ability to replicate and cause cytopathic effects in CHSE-214 cells, may be differentiated into three CHSE phenotypes: replicating cytopathic, replicating non-cytopathic, and non-replicating. Thus, the SYBR Green real-time RT\u2013PCR is a sensitive, rapid, and highly reproducible assay that can be used to quantitate ISAV in biological samples.","publish_time":"2004-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munir, Khalid; Kibenge, Frederick S.B","journal":"J Virol Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/10d71f398268a426c7f43f39f62b6280e8ad7971.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172414.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093403003975; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093403003975","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SYBR Green","ISAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCR assay","Temporal analysis of ISAV","different ISAV isolates","tube RT","ISAV experimental infection","ISAV RNA segment","reproducible assay","melting curve analysis","SYBR Green real-time RT","regular RT","detection of ISAV nucleic acids","Quantitative analysis of CHSE","Analysis of different tissues","gel electrophoresis analyses of real-time RT","entire optimized assay","virus-specific single melting peak","tube real-time reverse transcription","non-replicating","cycle of reverse transcription","virus population","cell cultures","cytopathic effects","specific viral RNA","fold","CHSE phenotypes","biological samples","SYBR Green chemistry","viral template concentrations","infectious salmon anaemia virus","mean threshold cycle","h post-inoculation","polymerase chain reaction","values","cycles of complementary DNA amplification","product","LightCycler technology","fish","data acquisition","regression line","ability","primers","duration","harmony","expected size","cells","U5575","times","targeted region","dilution range","bp","slope"],"language":"en"},

Healthcare service systems are one of the main social systems that can also be understood using network-based approaches, for example, to identify and evaluate influential providers. In this paper, we propose a network-based method with privacy-preserving for identifying influential providers in large healthcare service systems. First, the provider-interacting network is constructed by employing publicly available information on locations and types of healthcare services of providers. Second, the ranking of nodes in the generated provider-interacting network is conducted in parallel on the basis of four nodal influence metrics. Third, the impact of the top-ranked influential nodes in the provider-interacting network is evaluated using three indicators. Compared with other research work based on patient-sharing networks, in this paper, the provider-interacting network of healthcare service providers can be roughly created according to the locations and the publicly available types of healthcare services, without the need for personally private electronic medical claims, thus protecting the privacy of patients. The proposed method is demonstrated by employing Physician and Other Supplier Data CY 2017, and can be applied to other similar datasets to help make decisions for the optimization of healthcare resources in the response to public health emergencies.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Xiaoyu; Mei, Gang; Cuomo, Salvatore; Xiao, Lei","journal":"Future Gener Comput Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d437a83aac3593fcea6eb2a6f6f5e56fc13b7ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157485.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X20303629?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296253/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167739X20303629; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.04.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["network of healthcare service providers","large healthcare service systems","network-based method","complex systems","physical systems","types of healthcare services of providers","influential providers","network-based approaches","main social systems","available types of healthcare services","optimization of healthcare resources","biological networks","computer networks","influential nodes","generated provider","locations","paper","available information","data science","privacy of patients","ranking of nodes","proposed method","Supplier Data CY","response","need","Physician","decisions","useful abstraction","private electronic medical claims","basis","public health emergencies","structure","example","nodal influence metrics","research work","similar datasets","impact","indicators"],"language":"en"},

In an attempt to identify novel tools that modulate IFN\u03B1/\u03B2 production, we used SELEX technology to screen RNA aptamers that specifically target RIG-I protein. Most of the selected RIG-I aptamers contained polyU motifs in the second half regions that played critical roles in the activation of RIG-I-mediated IFN\u03B2 production. Unlike other known ligands, RIG-I aptamer bound and activated RIG-I in a 5\u2032-triphosphate-independent manner. The helicase and RD domain of RIG-I were used for aptamer binding, but intact RIG-I protein was required to exert aptamer-mediated signaling activation. Furthermore, replication of NDV, VSV and influenza virus in infected host cells was efficiently blocked by pre- or post-treatment with RIG-I aptamer.

Methods In a multicenter prospective surveillance study of adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we compared the presenting clinical features, pathogens present, and outcomes of patients with pneumonia visualized on a CT scan but not on a concurrent chest radiograph (CT-only pneumonia) and those with pneumonia visualized on a chest radiograph. All patients underwent chest radiography; the decision to obtain CT imaging was determined by the treating clinicians. Chest radiographs and CT images were interpreted by study-dedicated thoracic radiologists blinded to the clinical data. Results The study population included 2,251 adults with CAP; 2,185 patients (97%) had pneumonia visualized on chest radiography, whereas 66 patients (3%) had pneumonia visualized on CT scan but not on concurrent chest radiography. Overall, these patients with CT-only pneumonia had a clinical profile similar to those with pneumonia visualized on chest radiography, including comorbidities, vital signs, hospital length of stay, prevalence of viral (30% vs 26%) and bacterial (12% vs 14%) pathogens, ICU admission (23% vs 21%), use of mechanical ventilation (6% vs 5%), septic shock (5% vs 4%), and inhospital mortality (0 vs 2%). Conclusions Adults hospitalized with CAP who had radiological evidence of pneumonia on CT scan but not on concurrent chest radiograph had pathogens, disease severity, and outcomes similar to patients who had signs of pneumonia on chest radiography. These findings support using the same management principles for patients with CT-only pneumonia and those with pneumonia seen on chest radiography.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Upchurch, Cameron P.; Grijalva, Carlos G.; Wunderink, Richard G.; Williams, Derek J.; Waterer, Grant W.; Anderson, Evan J.; Zhu, Yuwei; Hart, Eric M.; Carroll, Frank; Bramley, Anna M.; Jain, Seema; Edwards, Kathryn M.; Self, Wesley H.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8acd225b05a43e6224f483c89c241f3724ff669.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5989638.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369217313922; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2017.07.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28802696/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369217313922","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["signs of pneumonia","concurrent chest radiography","CT scan","clinical significance of pneumonia","Chest radiographs","vs","normal chest radiograph","CT imaging","CT images","radiological evidence of pneumonia","outcomes of patients","CAP","clinical data","clinical profile similar","pathogens present","outcomes similar","presenting clinical features","study population","Conclusions Adults","multicenter prospective surveillance study of adults","vital signs","disease severity","hospital length of stay","comorbidities","community","setting","decision","prevalence of viral","Methods","thoracic radiologists","management principles","ICU admission","septic shock","treating clinicians","inhospital mortality","findings","mechanical ventilation"],"language":"en"},

While the upper region of SL1 is required to be paired, we observe strong genetic selection against viruses that contain a deletion of A35, an extrahelical nucleotide that destabilizes SL1, in favor of genomes that contain a diverse panel of destabilizing second-site mutations, due to introduction of a non-canonical base pair near A35. Viruses containing destabilizing SL1-\u0394A35 mutations also contain one of two specific mutations in the 3\u0027 UTR.

Consequences of working in high containment are the practical difficulties associated with containing specialist assays and equipment often essential for experimental analyses. In an era of increased interest in biodefence pathogens and emerging diseases, immunological analysis has developed rapidly alongside traditional techniques in virology and molecular biology. For example, in order to maximise the use of small sample volumes, multiplexing has become a more popular and widespread approach to quantify multiple analytes simultaneously, such as cytokines and chemokines. The luminex microsphere system allows for the detection of many cytokines and chemokines in a single sample, but the detection method of using aligned lasers and fluidics means that samples often have to be analysed in low containment facilities. In order to perform cytokine analysis in materials from high containment (CL3 and CL4 laboratories), we have developed an appropriate inactivation methodology after staining steps, which although results in a reduction of median fluorescent intensity, produces statistically comparable outcomes when judged against non-inactivated samples. This methodology thus extends the use of luminex technology for material that contains highly pathogenic biological agents.","publish_time":"2009-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dowall, Stuart D.; Graham, Victoria A.; Tipton, Thomas R.W.; Hewson, Roger","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/461b564bb8408e3d59dbe3317de8e603d3d0d9c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094240.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19560467/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002217590900194X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2009.06.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S002217590900194X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high containment","containment level","use of biological containment facilities","low containment facilities","pathogenic material","CL3","use of luminex technology","cytokines","CL4 laboratories","order","chemokines","use of small sample volumes","pathogenic biological agents","immunological analysis","detection method","cytokine analysis","single sample","containing specialist assays","non-inactivated samples","appropriate inactivation methodology","luminex microsphere system","specialist laboratory engineering structures","microbiological safety cabinets","biodefence pathogens","comparable outcomes","equipment","practical difficulties","materials","traditional techniques","emerging diseases","results","reduction of median fluorescent intensity","staining steps","aligned lasers","multiplexing","multiple analytes","widespread approach","virology","molecular biology","fluidics","experimental analyses","era of increased","Abstract Work","Consequences","example"],"language":"en"},

Using the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we previously demonstrated that antagonism of the chemokine receptor CXCR7 blocks endothelial cell sequestration of CXCL12, thereby enhancing the abluminal localization of CXCR4-expressing leukocytes. CXCR7 antagonism led to decreased parenchymal entry of leukocytes and amelioration of ongoing disease during EAE. Of note, animals that received high doses of CXCR7 antagonist recovered to baseline function, as assessed by standard clinical scoring. Because functional recovery reflects axonal integrity, we utilized diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate axonal injury in CXCR7 antagonist- versus vehicle-treated mice after recovery from EAE. METHODS: C57BL6/J mice underwent adoptive transfer of MOG-reactive Th1 cells and were treated daily with either CXCR7 antagonist or vehicle for 28 days; and then evaluated by DTI to assess for axonal injury. After imaging, spinal cords underwent histological analysis of myelin and oligodendrocytes via staining with luxol fast blue (LFB), and immunofluorescence for myelin basic protein (MBP) and glutathione S-transferase-\u03C0 (GST-\u03C0). Detection of non-phosphorylated neurofilament H (NH-F) was also performed to detect injured axons. Statistical analysis for EAE scores, DTI parameters and non-phosphorylated NH-F immunofluorescence were done by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. For all statistical analysis a p \u003C 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In vivo DTI maps of spinal cord ventrolateral white matter (VLWM) axial diffusivities of na\u00EFve and CXCR7 antagonist-treated mice were indistinguishable, while vehicle-treated animals exhibited decreased axial diffusivities. Quantitative differences in injured axons, as assessed via detection of non-phosphorylated NH-F, were consistent with axial diffusivity measurements. Overall, qualitative myelin content and presence of oligodendrocytes were similar in all treatment groups, as expected by their radial diffusivity values. Quantitative assessment of persistent inflammatory infiltrates revealed significant decreases within the parenchyma of CXCR7 antagonist-treated mice versus controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CXCR7 antagonism not only prevents persistent inflammation but also preserves axonal integrity. Thus, targeting CXCR7 modifies both disease severity and recovery during EAE, suggesting a role for this molecule in both phases of disease.","publish_time":"2011-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cruz-Orengo, Lillian; Chen, Ying-Jr; Kim, Joong Hee; Dorsey, Denise; Song, Sheng-Kwei; Klein, Robyn S","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70c53ce121228fdd6ba78b20f143736b56f71984.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3305694.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-8-170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22145790/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAE","DTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CXCR7 antagonism","parenchyma of CXCR7 antagonist-treated mice","high doses of CXCR7 antagonist","vehicle-treated mice","chemokine receptor CXCR7","vehicle-treated animals","EAE scores","axonal integrity","axonal injury","non-phosphorylated NH-F immunofluorescence","detection of non-phosphorylated NH-F","DTI parameters","J mice","Statistical analysis","histological analysis of myelin","decreased axial diffusivities","axial diffusivities of na\u00EFve","Detection of non-phosphorylated neurofilament H","axial diffusivity measurements","functional recovery","disease severity","phases of disease","injured axons","myelin basic protein","qualitative myelin content","parenchymal entry of leukocytes","pathological trafficking of leukocytes","amelioration of ongoing disease","DTI maps of spinal cord ventrolateral white matter","presence of oligodendrocytes","spinal cords","persistent inflammation","significant decreases","GST-\u03C0","Quantitative differences","Quantitative assessment of persistent inflammatory infiltrates","murine MS model","diffusion tensor imaging","radial diffusivity values","VLWM","adoptive transfer of MOG","MBP","staining","glutathione S-transferase","LFB","endothelial cell sequestration of CXCL12","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","luxol fast blue","central nervous system","C57BL6","ANOVA","reactive Th1 cells","role","days","abluminal localization of CXCR4","controls","treatment groups","Bonferroni post-","test","CNS","BACKGROUND","Multiple Sclerosis","note","molecule","METHODS","RESULTS","data","standard clinical scoring","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Dog circovirus (DogCV) is a new mammalian circovirus that is considered to be a cause of alimentary syndromes such as diarrhea, vomiting and hemorrhagic enteritis. DogCV has previously only been identified in the United States, Italy, Germany (GeneBank accession number: KF887949) and China (GeneBank accession number: KT946839). Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of DogCV in Taiwan and to explore the correlation between diarrhea and DogCV infection. Clinical specimens were collected between 2012 and 2014 from 207 dogs suffering from diarrhea and 160 healthy dogs. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a sensitive and specific SYBR Green-based real-time PCR assays to detected DogCV in naturally infected animals. Of the analyzed fecal samples from diarrheal dogs and health dogs, 58 (28.0 %) and 19 (11.9 %), respectively, were DogCV positive. The difference in DogCV prevalence was highly significant (P = 0.0002755) in diarrheal dogs. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to reveal that DogCV is currently circulating in domestic dogs in Taiwan and to demonstrate its high detection rate in dogs with diarrhea.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the acquisition and retention of H9N2 AIV on and within the house fly, Musca domestica (Linnaeus 1758), under laboratory conditions. In first experiment, 100 adult house flies were divided into control and treatment groups equally. Treatment group was fed with a meal containing H9N2 virus, while control group was supplied with an identical meal without virus. Fifteen minutes after exposure in each group, flies were washed twice to remove surface particles, disinfected and then homogenized for testing. The two external body surface washes and the homogenate samples were tested for H9N2 to distinguish exterior from interior viral load. Second experiment was performed likewise but five flies from each group were taken at 0, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h post-exposure. All samples were subjected to real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) for detecting H9-Specific viral RNA. Results of the first experiment showed that viral RNA was detectable in both of external surface and homogenates samples. Second experiment revealed that persistence of H9N2 AIVs on external body surface and within the body of M. domestica were 24 and 96 h, respectively. Moreover, viral RNAs concentration declined during the time after exposure to AIV H9N2 either outside or within house flies. Overall, house fly was able to acquire and preserve H9N2 AIV experimentally, which may contribute the spread of virus among poultry farms.","publish_time":"2019-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salamatian, Iman; Moshaverinia, Ali; Razmyar, Jamshid; Ghaemi, Mehran","journal":"J Med Entomol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/787e4e8e3cd12bbcfff3a624fec87466fe122a90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107433.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjz175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603474/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AIV H9N2","H9N2 virus","retention of H9N2 AIV","experiment","external surface","persistence of H9N2 AIVs","house fly","control group","adult house flies","external body surface washes","surface particles","spread of virus","homogenate samples","H9-Specific viral RNA","Avian influenza virus","viral RNAs concentration","interior viral load","homogenates samples","h post-exposure","identical meal","Musca domestica","poultry farms","treatment groups","real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","RRT-PCR","Linnaeus","acquisition","exterior","important disease","humans","study","laboratory conditions","minutes","aim","mammals","Results","testing"],"language":"en"},

There is little information about the systemic cytokine status in viral respiratory-infected asthmatic patients compared with non-asthmatic patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine changes in circulating cytokines (IL-1\u03B2, TNF-\u03B1, IL-4, IL-5) and chemokines (MCP1: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and RANTES: regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) in patients with an asthmatic versus a non-asthmatic background with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus or adenovirus respiratory infection. In addition, human monocyte cultures were incubated with respiratory viruses to determine the cytokine/chemokine profiles. PATIENTS/METHODS: Patients with asthmatic (n = 34) and non-asthmatic (n = 18) history and respiratory infections with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, and adenovirus were studied. Healthy individuals with similar age and sex (n = 10) were used as controls. Cytokine/chemokine content in blood and culture supernatants was determined by ELISA. Monocytes were isolated by Hystopaque gradient and cocultured with each of the above-mentioned viruses. RESULTS: Similar increased cytokine concentrations were observed in asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. However, higher concentrations of chemokines were observed in asthmatic patients. Virus-infected monocyte cultures showed similar cytokine/chemokine profiles to those observed in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating cytokine profiles induced by acute viral lung infection were not related to asthmatic status, except for chemokines that were already increased in the asthmatic status. Monocytes could play an important role in the increased circulating concentration of cytokines found during respiratory viral infections.","publish_time":"2013-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Giuffrida, Mar\u00EDa J; Valero, Nereida; Mosquera, Jes\u00FAs; Alvarez de Mon, Melchor; Chac\u00EDn, Betulio; Espina, Luz Marina; Gotera, Jennifer; Bermudez, John; Mavarez, Alibeth","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5300635b9c02f28ee26a26ee5547b6bc16cd0139.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4177805.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23962134/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-asthmatic patients","asthmatic status","viral respiratory-infected asthmatic patients","non-asthmatic background","respiratory infections","cytokine profiles","similar cytokine","Respiratory viral infections","respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","different cytokine","adenovirus respiratory infection","chemokine profiles","Similar increased cytokine concentrations","systemic cytokine status","parainfluenza virus","Virus-infected monocyte cultures","chemokine content","circulating cytokines","acute viral lung infection","increased circulating concentration of cytokines","human monocyte cultures","similar age","higher concentrations of chemokines","Monocytes","monocyte chemoattractant protein","lung tissues","above-mentioned viruses","RANTES","history","activation normal T cell","culture supernatants","sex","significant influence","important role","blood","study","Healthy individuals","TNF-\u03B1","MCP1","changes","little information","RESULTS","METHODS","addition","OBJECTIVES","aim","ELISA","Hystopaque gradient","CONCLUSIONS","controls"],"language":"en"},

Three proteins (\u03B1a, \u03B2a, and \u03B3a) are translated directly from the genomic RNAs and the remaining proteins encoded on RNA\u03B2 and RNA\u03B3 are expressed via three subgenomic messenger RNAs (sgRNAs). sgRNA\u03B21 directs synthesis of the triple gene block 1 (TGB1) protein. The TGB2 protein, the TGB2\u2032 minor translational readthrough protein, and the TGB3 protein are expressed from sgRNA\u03B22, which is present in considerably lower abundance than sgRNA\u03B21. A third sgRNA, sgRNA\u03B3, is required for expression of the \u03B3b protein. We have used deletion analyses and site-specific mutations to define the boundaries of promoter regions that are critical for expression of the BSMV sgRNAs in infected protoplasts. The results reveal that the sgRNA\u03B21 promoter encompasses positions \u221229 to \u22122 relative to its transcription start site and is adjacent to a cis-acting element required for RNA\u03B2 replication that maps from \u2212107 to \u221274 relative to the sgRNA\u03B21 start site. The core sgRNA\u03B22 promoter includes residues \u221232 to \u221217 relative to the sgRNA\u03B22 transcriptional start site, although maximal activity requires an upstream hexanucleotide sequence residing from positions \u221264 to \u221259. The sgRNA\u03B3 promoter maps from \u221221 to \u002B2 relative to its transcription start site and therefore partially overlaps the \u03B3a gene. The sgRNA\u03B21, \u03B22, and \u03B3 promoters also differ substantially in sequence, but have similarities to the putative homologous promoters of other Hordeiviruses. These differences are postulated to affect competition for the viral polymerase, coordination of the temporal expression and abundance of the TGB proteins, and constitutive expression of the \u03B3b protein.","publish_time":"2003-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Jennifer A; Bragg, Jennifer N; Lawrence, Diane M; Jackson, Andrew O","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98c4a6564e0874970a8434b8e2316d2333c1fbe2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172551.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268220300285X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268220300285X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BSMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGB2 protein","\u03B3b protein","sgRNA\u03B21 promoter","TGB3 protein","minor translational readthrough protein","sgRNA\u03B22 transcriptional start site","core sgRNA\u03B22 promoter","sgRNA\u03B3 promoter maps","temporal expression","constitutive expression","TGB proteins","remaining proteins","major proteins","genomic RNAs","BSMV sgRNAs","\u03B3 promoters","boundaries of promoter regions","positions","\u03B3a gene","subgenomic messenger RNAs","lower abundance","RNA\u03B2 replication","upstream hexanucleotide sequence","triple gene block","putative homologous promoters","maximal activity","coordination","designated \u03B1","Abstract Barley stripe mosaic virus","cis-acting element","site-specific mutations","viral polymerase","positive-sense","competition","similarities","synthesis","TGB1","residues","infected protoplasts","deletion analyses","Hordeiviruses","\u03B1a","\u03B2a","results","differences"],"language":"en"},

The authors have demonstrated that combining such mAbs, which target distinct epitopes, may greatly increase inhibition of virus infection and suppress the generation of neutralization escape mutants. The inhibition of human mAbs to SARS-coronavirus (CoV) may also act through different mechanisms of action, depending on their target epitopes or regions. Therefore, this approach could provide fast and effective prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV infection during a SARS outbreak. Specifically, Coughlin et al. have indicated that most of the tested anti-S1 mAbs recognized epitopes within the receptor-binding domain and blocked virus attachment to its cellular receptor. These findings could provide a further step in understanding the mechanism of these mAbs in the prevention of SARS-CoV infection, as well as an insight into the design and development of novel therapeutic treatments.","publish_time":"2010-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"Future Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a7edf855d8f2c6fbde99ebbd5465866665b46b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7079818.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32201501/; https://doi.org/10.2217/fvl.09.78","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-coronavirus","CoV infection","inhibition of human mAbs","treatment of SARS","prevention of SARS","SARS outbreak","inhibition of virus infection","different mechanisms of action","target epitopes","Human monoclonal antibodies","tested anti-S1 mAbs","distinct epitopes","Coughlin","cellular receptor","blocked virus attachment","receptor-binding domain","Prabhakar BS","Babcook J","effective prophylaxis","design","passive immunotherapy","development of novel therapeutic treatments","generation of neutralization escape mutants","approach","insight","step","work","Evaluation","regions","findings","authors","Virology"],"language":"en"},

Symptomatic dogs presented the highest infection rate and intensity of infection.","publish_time":"2007-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"da Costa-Val, Adriane Pimenta; Cavalcanti, Reginaldo Roris; de Figueiredo Gontijo, Nelder; Marques Michalick, Marilene Suzan; Alexander, Bruce; Williams, Paul; Melo, Maria Norma","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9b7e741f8d18d39308f908ac84b30b8434e8476.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110440.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023306002450; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023306002450","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptomatic dogs","ears of dogs","highest infection rate","intensity of infection","dissected sandflies","highest rate of infectivity","positive mongrel dogs","main source of Leishmania infantum infection","phlebotomine sandflies","Lutzomyia longipalpis","highest proportion of","oligosymptomatic","total anti-Leishmania IgG","higher total IgG","intensity of clinical signs","IgG2 concentrations","clinical status","asymptomatic animals","infected dog","IgG2 subclasses of antibody","GT","IgG1","humoral responses","lower haematocrit levels","immunoglobulin","humans","haematology","crude antigen of","anaemia","study reports","correlation","days","results","Promastigotes"],"language":"en"},

Based on the public datasets provided by John Hopkins university and Canadian health authority, we have developed a forecasting model of COVID-19 outbreak in Canada using state-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) models. In this novel research, we evaluated the key features to predict the trends and possible stopping time of the current COVID-19 outbreak in Canada and around the world. In this paper we presented the Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a deep learning approach to forecast the future COVID-19 cases. Based on the results of our Long short-term memory (LSTM) network, we predicted the possible ending point of this outbreak will be around June 2020. In addition to that, we compared transmission rates of Canada with Italy and USA. Here we also presented the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 th day predictions for 2 successive days.

METHODS: A survey comprising questions based on risk perception theories, in particular PMT, was conducted with a Dutch sample. RESULTS: Although fear that an influenza pandemic may occur was high, participants do not feel well informed. General practitioners and local health authorities were considered trustworthy sources of information and the information considered most urgent pertained to which protective measures should be taken. Participants reported an intention to comply with recommendations regarding protective measures. However, response and self efficacy were low. Maladaptive behaviours can be expected. Increasing numbers of ill individuals and school closures are also expected to lead to a decreased work force. Participants indicated wanting antiviral drugs even if the supply were to be insufficient. CONCLUSIONS: Messages regarding health protective behaviours from local health authorities should anticipate the balance between overreacting and underreacting. Also, when protective recommendations from health professionals conflict with company policies, it is unclear how employees will react.","publish_time":"2010-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kok, Gerjo; Jonkers, Ruud; Gelissen, Roger; Meertens, Ree; Schaalma, Herman; de Zwart, Onno","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0f7f46699d0ecf0c7ead699d564d952508e6f81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2861057.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20353568/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health protective behaviours","protective recommendations","protective measures","participants","local health authorities","health professionals conflict","influenza pandemic","Maladaptive behaviours","trustworthy sources of information","company policies","risk perception theories","questions","balance","Messages","particular PMT","numbers of ill individuals","school closures","survey","General practitioners","CONCLUSIONS","supply","self efficacy","overreacting","antiviral drugs","fear","intention","decreased work force","METHODS","underreacting","employees","RESULTS","Dutch sample","behavioural responses","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with neurological diseases. Development Neurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement. Conclusion Although neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mat\u00EDas-Guiu, J.; Gomez-Pinedo, U.; Montero-Escribano, P.; Gomez-Iglesias, P.; Porta-Etessam, J.; Matias-Guiu, J.

Patients with COVID-19 showed huge differences in the hospital stays, progression and prognosis. As reported, the comorbidities may play an important role in COVID-19. Here, we aim to address the role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. Methods 83 confirmed COVID-19 patients were divided into the CVD (n=42) and non-CVD (n=41) group according to their medical history. Medical records information including demographic data, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, chest computed tomography (CT) as well as treatment measures were collected, analyzed and compared between two groups. Results COVID-19 patients with CVD showed: (1) more severe pathological changes in the lung, (2) elevated injury-related enzymes including \u03B1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HDBH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), \u03B3-glutamyltransferase (GGT), creatine kinase (CK) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), (3) significantly increased uncontrolled inflammation related markers, such as c-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, serum ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum amyloid A (SAA), (4) serious hypercoagulable status reflected by increased D-dimer and serum fibrinogen (FIB), and (5) higher mortality, compared to COVID-19 patients without CVD. Conclusions Our data indicated that CVD is a strong risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19. More intensive medical care should be applied to patients with CVD to prevent rapid deterioration of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Mingyue; Dong, Yalan; Wang, Haijun; Guo, Weina; Zhou, Haifeng; Zhang, Zili; Tian, Chunxia; Du, Keye; Zhu, Rui; Wang, Li; Zhao, Lei; Fan, Heng; Luo, Shanshan; Hu, Desheng","journal":"Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca2d65700dcef4081a5e02d1d1bc2432016979a8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475320301344?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.04.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0939475320301344","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Patients","confirmed COVID","Results COVID","non-CVD","bad prognosis of COVID","medical history","rapid progression","Coronavirus Disease","serum ferritin","serum fibrinogen","serum amyloid","Medical records information","intensive medical care","role of cardiovascular disease","lactate dehydrogenase","demographic data","rapid deterioration","important role","\u03B1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase","increased D-dimer","severe pathological changes","novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus","elevated injury-related enzymes","uncontrolled inflammation related markers","laboratory examinations","clinical characteristics","chest computed tomography","ESR","HDBH","erythrocyte sedimentation rate","creatine kinase","strong risk factor","Abstract Background","CRP","GGT","c-reactive protein","\u03B3-glutamyltransferase","lung","LDH","hospital stays","huge differences","serious hypercoagulable status","alanine aminotransferase","SARS-CoV","interleukin","IL","pneumonia","ALT","SAA","Methods","treatment measures","comorbidities","higher mortality","Conclusions","Wuhan","China","world","groups"],"language":"en"},

The receiver\u0027s exposure to the droplet nuclei is analyzed under two orientations relative to the source. Two droplet nuclei, 0.1 and 10\u03BCm, with different emission velocities, are selected to represent large expiratory droplets which can still be inhaled into the human respiratory tracts. The droplet dispersion and mixing characteristics under well-mixed and displacement ventilation schemes are evaluated and compared numerically. Results show that the droplet dispersion and mixing under displacement ventilation is consistently poorer. Very low concentration regions are also observed in the displacement scheme. For both ventilation schemes, the intake dose will be reduced substantially if the droplets are emitted under the face-to-wall orientation rather than the face-to-face orientation.

Unfortunately, early investigations that used recycled \u201Cpedigree\u201D virus strains seem to have led microbiologists to dismiss the common folk belief that vARIs often follow chilling. Today, incontrovertible evidence shows that ambient temperature dips and host chilling increase the incidence and severity of vARIs. This review considers four possible mechanisms, M1 - 4, that can explain this link: (M1) increased crowding in winter may enhance viral transmission; (M2) lower temperatures may increase the stability of virions outside the body; (M3) chilling may increase host susceptibility; (M4) lower temperatures or host chilling may activate dormant virions. There is little evidence for M1 or M2, which are incompatible with tropical observations. Epidemiological anomalies such as the repeated simultaneous arrival of vARIs over wide geographical areas, the rapid cessation of influenza epidemics, and the low attack rate of influenza within families are compatible with M4, but not M3 (in its simple form). M4 seems to be the main driver of seasonality, but M3 may also play an important role.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaw Stewart, Patrick D.","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68ac63121bded12e1db3178a0c9b050154f81ab8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116927.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2015.11.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698771500417X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26608252/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030698771500417X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host chilling","M3","M4","M1","severity of vARIs","host susceptibility","lower temperatures","M2","Abstract Influenza","winter","repeated simultaneous arrival of vARIs","viral transmission","rapid cessation of influenza epidemics","low attack rate of influenza","incontrovertible evidence","stability of virions","dormant virions","little evidence","common folk belief","main driver of seasonality","viral acute respiratory tract infections","wide geographical areas","ambient temperature dips","RSV","families","pedigree","rhinovirus","adenovirus","metapneumovirus","microbiologists","crowding","incidence","unrelated viruses","virus strains","coronavirus","body","Epidemiological anomalies","early investigations","review","possible mechanisms","tropical observations","simple form","important role","link","summer"],"language":"en"},

The nucleotide sequence of the LV genome was determined from a set of overlapping cDNA clones. A consecutive sequence of 15,088 nucleotides was obtained. Eight open reading frames (ORFs) that might encode virus-specific proteins were identified. ORF1a and ORF1b are predicted to encode the vital RNA polymerase because the amino acid sequence contains sequence elements that are conserved in RNA polymerases of the torovirus Berne virus (BEV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), the coronaviruses, and other positive-strand RNA viruses. A heptanucleotide slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) and a putative pseudoknot structure, which are both required for efficient ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the RNA polymerase ORF 1b of BEV, EAV, and the coronaviruses, were identified in the overlapping region of ORF1a and ORF1b of LV. ORFs 2 to 6 probably encode viral membrane-associated proteins, whereas ORF7 is predicted to encode the nucleocapsid protein. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the ORFs identified in the genome of LV, LDV, and EAV indicated that LV and LDV are more closely related than LV and EAV. A 3\u2032 nested set of six subgenomic RNAs was detected in LV-infected cells. These subgenomic RNAs contain a common leader sequence that is derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA and that is joined to the 3\u2032 terminal body sequence. Our results indicate that LV is closely related evolutionarily to LDV and EAV, both members of a recently proposed family of positive-strand RNA viruses, the Arteriviridae.","publish_time":"1993-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meulenberg, Janneke J.M.; Hulst, Marcel M.; de Meijer, Emile J.; Moonen, Peter L.J.M.; den Besten, Annelien; de Kluyver, Eric P.; Wensvoort, Gert; Moormann, Rob J.M.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682283710081; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682283710081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LV","ORF","EAV","LDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EAV","LV genome","genome of LV","RNA polymerases","sequence elements","nucleotide sequence","LDV","consecutive sequence","RNA polymerase ORF","vital RNA polymerase","positive-strand RNA viruses","genome of Lelystad virus","ORFs","polyadenylated RNA molecule","common leader sequence","heptanucleotide slippery sequence","terminal body sequence","LV-infected cells","virus-specific proteins","equine arteritis virus","torovirus Berne virus","lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus","subgenomic RNAs","coronaviruses","ORF1b of","amino acid sequences","overlapping region of ORF1a","b of BEV","nested set","set of overlapping cDNA clones","proposed family of positive","viral membrane-associated proteins","respiratory syndrome","causative agent of porcine epidemic abortion","UUUAAAC","translation","ORF7","efficient ribosomal frameshifting","members","putative pseudoknot structure","mystery swine disease","open reading frames","Comparison","Arteriviridae","nucleotides","end","nucleocapsid protein","results"],"language":"en"},

The local Renin Angiotensin System plays an important role in lung injury and inflammation. Particularly, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) has been identified as a protective lung enzyme against the insult. ACE-2 converts pro-apoptotic Angiotensin II to anti-apoptotic Angiotensin 1\u20137. However, the effect of meconium on ACE-2 has never been studied before. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of meconium on ACE-2, and whether inhibition of proteolytic enzymes present in the meconium reverses its effects on ACE-2. METHODS: Alveolar epithelial A549 cells were exposed to F-12 medium, 2.5% meconium, meconium \u002B a protease inhibitor cocktail (PIc) and PIc alone for 16 h. At the end of incubation, apoptosis was measured with a nuclear fragmentation assay and cell lysates were collected for ACE-2 immunoblotting and enzyme activity. RESULTS: Meconium caused a fourfold increase in apoptotic nuclei (p \u003C 0.001). The pro-apoptotic effect of meconium can be reversed by PIc. Meconium reduced ACE-2 enzyme activity by cleaving ACE-2 into a fragment detected at ~ 37 kDa by immunoblot. PIc prevented the degradation of ACE-2 and restored 50% of ACE-2 activity (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that meconium causes degradation of lung protective ACE-2 by proteolytic enzymes present in meconium, since the effects of meconium can be reversed by PIc.","publish_time":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gandhi, Chintan K.; Holmes, Romel; Gewolb, Ira H.; Uhal, Bruce D.","journal":"Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ec6ea6d41e9c00b249f42c79fd1b45a300254c6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088148.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00408-019-00201-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30759273/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Renin Angiotensin System"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of meconium","degradation of ACE","cleaving ACE","pro-apoptotic effect of meconium","meconium-induced lung injury","PIc","degradation of lung protective ACE","enzyme activity","pro-apoptotic Angiotensin","protective lung enzyme","anti-apoptotic Angiotensin","apoptotic nuclei","inhibition of proteolytic enzymes present","Pancreatic digestive enzymes present","local Renin Angiotensin System","important role","fourfold increase","protease inhibitor cocktail","cell lysates","Alveolar epithelial A549 cells","nuclear fragmentation assay","apoptosis","METHODS","inflammation","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","data","insult","medium","immunoblotting","end of incubation","CONCLUSION","kDa","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Despite recent progress in identifying and analyzing the coronavirus that is responsible for it, few reports have addressed the clinical complications of SARS. The present study was a two-center retrospective cohort study. All patients in the study had SARS, were managed in the two major Hong Kong hospitals (ie, Prince of Wales Hospital and United Christian Hospital), and had developed spontaneous pneumothorax during their hospitalization between March 10, 2003, and April 28, 2003. Spontaneous pneumothorax was reported in 6 of 356 SARS patients who were treated at the two hospitals during the period. This represents an incidence of 1.7%. None of the six patients had a history of smoking or pulmonary disease. The rate of admission to the ICU was 66.7% and the crude mortality rate was 33.3% in this group of patients. There was a trend for the mean neutrophil count in these patients to be higher than in previously reported cohorts of comparable SARS patients (14.5 \u00D7 10 9 vs 4.6 \u00D7 10 9 neutrophils per liter, respectively). Conservative measures like tube thoracostomy or observation alone offered satisfactory initial symptomatic management in five of six patients. Spontaneous pneumothorax is a specific and potentially life-threatening complication in SARS patients. Patients with extensive lung injury, as indicated by severe clinical courses, and in particular high neutrophil counts, appear to be most at risk.

We collected 11,399 throat swabs from hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection from July 2009 to June 2016 in Guangzhou, China. These were tested for four strains of HCoV infection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCoV-positive patients were then tested for 11 other respiratory pathogens. 4.3% (489/11399) of patients were positive for HCoV, of which 3.0% were positive for OC43 (346/11399), 0.6% for 229E (65/11399), 0.5% for NL63 (60/11399), and 0.3% for HKU1 (38/11399). Patients aged 7\u201312 months had the highest prevalence of HCoV and OC43 when compared with other age groups (p \u003C 0.001). The peak seasons of infection varied depending on the HCoV strain. Patients infected with a single strain of HCoV infection were less likely to present fever (\u2265 38 \u00B0C) (p = 0.014) and more likely to present pulmonary rales (p = 0.043) than those co-infected with more than one HCoV strain or other respiratory pathogens. There were also significant differences in the prevalence of certain symptoms, including coughing (p = 0.032), pneumonia (p = 0.026), and abnormal pulmonary rales (p = 0.002) according to the strain of HCoV detected. This retrospective study of the prevalence of four HCoV strains and clinical signs among a large population of pediatric patients in a subtropical region of China provides further insight into the epidemiology and clinical features of HCoV.","publish_time":"2017-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Zhi-Qi; Chen, De-Hui; Tan, Wei-Ping; Qiu, Shu-Yan; Xu, Duo; Liang, Huan-Xi; Chen, Mei-Xin; Li, Xiao; Lin, Zheng-Shi; Liu, Wen-Kuan; Zhou, Rong","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82c17f8de937704b2522db77b863f8f01ab19414.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780525.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-017-3144-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29214503/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HCoV strains","HCoV-positive patients","strains of HCoV infection","clinical features of HCoV","highest prevalence of HCoV","single strain of HCoV infection","respiratory pathogens","OC43","acute respiratory tract infection","common respiratory viruses","various respiratory diseases","clinical signs","clinical manifestations","epidemiology","peak seasons of infection","large population of pediatric patients","HKU1","NL63","pneumonia","prevalence of certain symptoms","abnormal pulmonary rales","present fever","subtropical region of China","hospitalized children","real-time polymerase chain reaction","insight","throat swabs","PCR","coughing","months","significant differences","paucity of evidence","age groups","Human coronaviruses","retrospective study","Guangzhou"],"language":"en"},

The primer sets for RT-LAMP were designed using highly conserved nucleotide sequences in the matrix protein region of subgroups A and B, and were specific for each subgroup. The RT-LAMP efficiency was compared to virus isolation and a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for RSV detection (BD Directigen EZ RSV test\u2122), using nasopharyngeal aspirates from 59 children with respiratory tract infections. The RT-LAMP was specific for RSV and could not detect other respiratory pathogens. 61% (36/59) of children were positive by RT-LAMP, 34% (20/59) by viral isolation, and 56% (26/46) by EZ RSV. Of 16 specimens that were negative by both antigen detection and virus isolation, 12.5% (2/16) were RT-LAMP positive.

The greater amount of CP being fed to preweaned calves may alter their nitrogen (N) balance, and excess N may be excreted in the urine. The objective of this study was to determine N utilization in preweaned calves fed diets varying in the amount of CP and MR fed. This study used 24 newborn dairy heifer calves blocked by birth and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: (1) 446g dry matter (DM) of a conventional MR (CON; 20% CP, 20% fat), (2) 669g DM of a moderately high protein MR (moderate; MOD; 26% CP, 18% fat), or (3) 892g DM of a moderately high protein MR (aggressive; AGG; 26% CP, 18% fat). All calves had ad libitum access to starter and water. Both MR and starter were medicated with decoquinate. During weaning (d 43\u201349), the morning MR feeding ceased. On d 50, all MR feedings ended; however, starter and water intakes were continuously recorded until d 56. At 5wk of age, urine was collected using urinary catheters for 3d and chromium oxide was administered by bolus at 2g/d for 7d to estimate N efficiency. Calves fed MOD and AGG had similar starter intakes, feed efficiencies, and ADG, with the combined treatments having reduced starter intakes (258 vs. 537g/d), greater ADG (674 vs. 422g/d), and improved feed efficiency (0.57 vs. 0.45 gain:feed) compared with CON calves preweaning. However, DMI and water intake were similar across all treatments. Results from the N utilization phase showed that MOD and AGG treatments had similar but lower N efficiency compared with CON calves (45.5 vs. 52.7%). This could be due to MOD- and AGG-fed calves having greater urine volume and thereby, greater combined urine N output compared with CON calves (17.6 vs. 12.1 g/d). In summary, feeding \u003E0.66kg (DM) from a 26% CP MR increased ADG and improved feed efficiency during the preweaning period but reduced starter intake and lowered N efficiency.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chapman, C.

Twenty-four conventional 5-day-old suckling piglets were randomly divided into four groups and were inoculated orally, intranasally (I.N.), intramuscularly (I.M.) with PEDV or DMEM (mock). Pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs and fecal viral load. Blood samples were collected at 7, 14, 21 days post infection (dpi) and subjected for the analyses of serum antibody production, T cell and natural killer (NK) cell frequencies, NK cytotoxicity and serum cytokine levels. Oral inoculation led to higher levels of PEDV-specific IgA antibodies in both serum and gut mucosal sites than did other routes of inoculation. Intranasal inoculation elicited significantly higher titers of virus-specific IgG antibodies in serum. PEDV-infected pigs regardless of inoculation routes had significantly lower NK cell frequencies than those of the control pigs at 14 dpi. The orally inoculated pigs had significantly higher CD3\u002BCD8\u002B T cell frequencies as compared to I.N. or I.M. inoculated pigs at 14 dpi, while there was no significant difference among orally, I.N. or I.M. inoculated pigs and control pigs in CD3\u002BCD4\u002B T cell frequencies in peripheral blood. PEDV-infected and control pigs had low, but detectable NK cell activities at 14 and 21 dpi, however, NK cell activities were barely detectable at 7 dpi whether the pigs were infected or not. Serum IL-10 levels were induced drastically in orally infected pigs at 7 dpi and then gradually declined. Serum IL-12 levels followed a similar pattern while the fold-change was much lower. In conclusion, oral inoculation may generate more comprehensive immune responses.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Yingshan; Chen, Cong; Chen, Yunlu; Liu, Ziqi; Zheng, Jingyou; Wang, Tingjun; Luo, Hao; Liu, Yajie; Shan, Ying; Fang, Weihuan; Li, Xiaoliang","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b26c1c4442a02d41b6a7f72e3e60443f4a773f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173071.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593385/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518310228; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518310228; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.11.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inoculated pigs","control pigs","PEDV-infected pigs","suckling pigs","T cell frequencies","lower NK cell frequencies","detectable NK cell activities","higher levels of PEDV","Serum IL","serum cytokine levels","routes of inoculation","inoculation routes","Oral inoculation","NK cytotoxicity","Intranasal inoculation","higher CD3","analyses of serum antibody production","higher titers of virus","mucosal immune responses","specific IgG antibodies","specific IgA antibodies","comprehensive immune responses","mucosal sites","peripheral blood","Blood samples","day-old suckling piglets","days post infection","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","natural killer","CD4","CD8","administration","clinical signs","similar pattern","fecal viral load","fold-change","effects of route","DMEM","mock","conclusion","significant difference","groups"],"language":"en"},

However, their effectiveness has not been evaluated against a comparator. The objective of this study is to evaluate their effectiveness in the disinfection of pathogens in the air in hospital blood sampling rooms. METHODS: Samples were taken from the air before and after disinfection with PX-UV and non-thermal atmospheric plasma. We counted bacterial colonies and identified the types of bacteria. RESULTS: Non-thermal plasma treatment significantly reduced bacterial counts in the air, the median reduced from 1 before treatment to zero afterwards (p = 0.03). PX-UV treatment also significantly reduced bacterial counts in the air (p = 0.01), the median reduced from 1.5 before treatment to zero afterwards.

Methods We conduct data-driven and model-free estimations for the growth rates of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and Canada, by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases. We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions. Results In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0.1 two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th, 2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost 7 days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.13 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.25 between March 13th to 22nd. This current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.7 days, and therefore, unless further public health interventions are escalated in Canada, we project 15,000 cases by March 31st. However, the case number may be reduced to 4000 if escalated public health interventions could instantly reduce the growth rate to 0.1, the same level achieved in Italy. Interpretation. Prompt and farsighted interventions are critical to counteract the very rapid initial growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada. Mitigation plans must take into account the delayed effect of interventions by up to 2-weeks and the short doubling time of 3\u20134 days.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scarabel, Francesca; Pellis, Lorenzo; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Wu, Jianhong","journal":"Infectious Disease Modelling","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6244bf0fdb7e70140c0210d3e552236259d58d9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300105; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300105?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["Canada","initial growth rate","current growth rate","growth rates","farsighted interventions","different scenarios of public health interventions","rapid initial growth","Italy","days","delayed effect of interventions","short doubling time","declaration of COVID","epidemic trends","weeks","different countries","daily reported cases","governments","account","exponential curve","decisions","local transmission chains","model-free estimations","epidemics","spread","data","Abstract Background","Prompt","estimates","Results","comparison","Mitigation plans","lockdown","country","pandemic","increase","level","case number","Methods","Interpretation"],"language":"en"},

Epitopes within these sites have been identified on the basis of cross-reactivity of MAb-resistant mutants against the panel of MAbs, determined by plaque assays and Western blotting. Site A contains three non-overlapping epitopes (A1, A2 and A3). A1 is the only linear epitope; all remaining epitopes are conformational. MAbs which react with epitopes A2 and A3 inhibit neuraminidase activity (NA) when assayed with neuraminlactose. Site B contains three partially overlapping epitopes (B1, B2 and B3) and site C is represented by a single epitope (C1). HN gene sequence analysis of MAb-resistant mutants showed that they each had only single amino acid substitutions which range from amino acid residues 347\u2013460 for site A, 284\u2013325 for site B, and at 481 for the Cl epitope.

Using IBV Arkansas-type (Ark) S protein histochemistry, we show that extension of S1 with the S2 ectodomain improves binding to chicken tissues. Although the S1 subunit is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies, vaccination with S1 protein has been shown to confer inadequate protection against challenge. The demonstrated contribution of S2 ectodomain to binding to chicken tissues suggests that vaccination with the ectodomain might improve protection compared to vaccination with S1 alone. Therefore, we immunized chickens with recombinant trimeric soluble IBV Ark-type S1 or S-ectodomain protein produced from codon-optimized constructs in mammalian cells. Chickens were primed at 12days of age with water-in-oil emulsified S1 or S-ectodomain proteins, and then boosted 21days later. Challenge was performed with virulent Ark IBV 21days after boost. Chickens immunized with recombinant S-ectodomain protein showed statistically significantly (P \u003C0.05) reduced viral loads 5days post-challenge in both tears and tracheas compared to chickens immunized with recombinant S1 protein. Consistent with viral loads, significantly reduced (P \u003C0.05) tracheal mucosal thickness and tracheal lesion scores revealed that recombinant S-ectodomain protein provided improved protection of tracheal integrity compared to S1 protein. These results indicate that the S2 domain has an important role in inducing protective immunity. Thus, including the S2 domain with S1 might be promising for better viral vectored and/or subunit vaccine strategies.","publish_time":"2017-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eldemery, Fatma; Joiner, Kellye S.; Toro, Haroldo; van Santen, Vicky L.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f7c73ef4a6a1db48974c4dd946a9b4e54f6ebaf2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111290.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X1731229X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1731229X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.09.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28899630/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant S1 protein","S1 subunit","recombinant S-ectodomain protein","extension of S1","S-ectodomain proteins","S protein histochemistry","S2 subunit","oil emulsified S1","chickens","recombinant trimeric soluble IBV Ark-type S1","demonstrated contribution of S2 ectodomain","S2 domain","viral loads","vaccination","virulent Ark IBV","days post-challenge","viral attachment","days of age","IBV Arkansas-type","improved protection of tracheal integrity","subunit vaccine strategies","chicken tissues","inadequate protection","binding","tracheal lesion scores","tracheal mucosal thickness","mammalian cells","major inducer of neutralizing antibodies","avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","codon-optimized constructs","spike","important role","water","tears","glycoprotein","tracheas","membrane fusion","boost","protective immunity","results"],"language":"en"},

Objective To study MxA protein levels in healthy state and during respiratory virus infection of young children in an observational prospective cohort. Study design Blood samples and nasal swabs were collected from 153 and 77 children with and without symptoms of respiratory infections, respectively. Blood MxA protein levels were measured by an enzyme immunoassay and PCR methods were used for the detection of respiratory viruses in nasal swabs. Results Respiratory viruses were detected in 81% of symptomatic children. They had higher blood MxA protein levels (median [interquartile range]) than asymptomatic virus-negative children (695 [345\u20131370] \u03BCg/L vs. 110 [55\u2013170] \u03BCg/L; p \u003C0.001). Within asymptomatic children, no significant difference was observed in MxA responses between virus-positive and virus-negative groups. A cut-off level of 175\u03BCg/L had 92% sensitivity and 77% specificity for a symptomatic respiratory virus infection. Rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus infections were associated with elevated MxA responses. Asymptomatic virus-negative children vaccinated with a live virus vaccine had elevated MxA protein levels (240 [120\u2013540] \u03BCg/L), but significantly lower than children with an acute respiratory infection, who had not received vaccinations (740 [350\u20131425] \u03BCg/L; p \u003C0.001). Conclusion Blood MxA protein levels are increased in young children with symptomatic respiratory virus infections, including rhinovirus infections.

The site-of-care decision is critical in determining the site and type of care as well as the extent of diagnostic workup. Antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible particularly in those requiring admission to hospital, but typically the physician does not know with any degree of certainty the identity of the etiologic pathogen. A number of national guidelines have been published to help the physician with this choice. The initial drug(s) can be modified if necessary if the pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility pattern becomes known.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of two nosocomial outbreaks of RSV at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA). Subjects included patients seen at the SCCA with RSV detected in two outbreaks in 2007-2008 and 2012, and all employees with respiratory viruses detected in the 2007-2008 outbreak. A subset of samples was sequenced using semi-nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the RSV attachment glycoprotein coding region. RESULTS: Fifty-one cases of RSV were identified in 2007-2008. Clustering of identical viral strains was detected in 10 (67%) of 15 patients with RSV sequenced from 2007-2008. As part of a multimodal infection control strategy implemented as a response to the outbreak, symptomatic employees had nasal washes collected. Of 254 employee samples, 91 (34%) tested positive for a respiratory virus, including 14 with RSV. In another RSV outbreak in 2012, 24 cases of RSV were identified; nine (90%) of 10 patients had the same viral strain, and 1 (10%) had another viral strain. CONCLUSIONS: We document spread of clonal strains within an outpatient cancer care setting. Infection control interventions should be implemented in outpatient, as well as inpatient, settings to reduce person-to-person transmission and limit progression of RSV outbreaks.","publish_time":"2014-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Helen Y.; Englund, Janet A.; Podczervinski, Sara; Kuypers, Jane; Campbell, Angela P.; Boeckh, Michael; Pergam, Steven A.; Casper, Crey","journal":"Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/152a15e0165086cf36a88a907a9f5742f59d369c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/50a0354c565a3f3939deb0de8c59c3ec519d08f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4036533.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1083879114001475; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1083879114001475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607551/; http://www.bbmt.org/article/S1083879114001475/pdf; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2014.02.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","Seattle Cancer Care Alliance"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of RSV","nosocomial outbreaks of RSV","document RSV transmission","limit progression of RSV outbreaks","cancer patients","RSV attachment glycoprotein coding region","outpatient cancer care setting","outpatient setting","person transmission","inpatient settings","SCCA","Respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory viruses","Seattle Cancer Care Alliance","Clustering of identical viral strains","Infection control interventions","clonal strains","symptomatic employees","multimodal infection control strategy","subset of samples","employee samples","semi-nested polymerase chain reaction","response","retrospective cohort study","poor outcomes","use of molecular epidemiology","nasal washes","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Subjects","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Eighty students responded to a questionnaire of which 19 met the case definition, a 24% attack rate. Faecal specimens from seven students contained Cryptosporidium oocysts and Cryptosporidium parvum IIa A18G3R1 was identified from one of the specimens. The inferred median incubation period was five days (range 1\u201312 days). All of the cases were self-limiting, characterized by diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, and in some cases vomiting, headache, and fever.

These pathogens are transmitted, directly or indirectly, and can lead to epidemics or even pandemics. The resulting infection may lead to mild-to-severe symptoms such as life-threatening fever or diarrhea. Infectious diseases may be asymptomatic in some individuals but may lead to disastrous effects in others. Despite the advances in medicine, infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, especially in low-income countries. With the advent of mathematical tools, scientists are now able to better predict epidemics, understand the specificity of each pathogen, and identify potential targets for drug development. Artificial intelligence and its components have been widely publicized for their ability to better diagnose certain types of cancer from imaging data. This chapter aims at identifying potential applications of machine learning in the field of infectious diseases. We are deliberately focusing on key aspects of infection: diagnosis, transmission, response to treatment, and resistance. We are proposing the use of extreme values as an avenue of interest for future developments in the field of infectious diseases.

Comparison peritoneal cells were collected from four healthy laboratory cats by peritoneal lavage and macrophages predominated in both populations. Differential mRNA expression analysis identified 5621 genes as deregulated in peritoneal cells from FIPV infected versus normal cats; 956 genes showed \u003E 2.0 Log(2) Fold Change (Log(2)FC) and 1589 genes showed \u003C \u22122.0 Log(2)FC. Eighteen significantly upregulated pathways were identified by InnateDB enrichment analysis. These pathways involved apoptosis, cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction, pathogen recognition, Jak-STAT signaling, NK cell mediated cytotoxicity, several chronic infectious diseases, graft versus host disease, allograft rejection and certain autoimmune disorders. Infected peritoneal macrophages were activated M1 type based on pattern of RNA expression. Apoptosis was found to involve large virus-laden peritoneal macrophages more than less mature macrophages, suggesting that macrophage death played a role in virus dissemination. Gene transcripts for MHC I but not II receptors were upregulated, while mRNA for receptors commonly associated with virus attachment and identified in other coronaviruses were either not detected (APN, L-SIGN), not deregulated (DDP-4) or down-regulated (DC-SIGN). However, the mRNA for Fc\u03B3RIIIA (CD16A/ADCC receptor) was significantly upregulated, supporting entry of virus as an immune complex. Analysis of KEGG associated gene transcripts indicated that Th1 polarization overshadowed Th2 polarization, but the addition of relevant B cell associated genes previously linked to FIP macrophages tended to alter this perception.","publish_time":"2018-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watanabe, Rie; Eckstrand, Christina; Liu, Hongwei; Pedersen, Niels C.","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66a6a5cb7b41fb6edd030629be7c455c079f47bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6081860.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30086792/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-018-0578-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Apoptosis"],"organizations":["FIPV","FC","NK","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Infected peritoneal macrophages","genes","large virus-laden peritoneal macrophages","peritoneal lavage","FIP macrophages","Comparison peritoneal cells","mature macrophages","entry of virus","virus dissemination","virus attachment","upregulated pathways","Differential mRNA expression analysis","passaged field strain of FIP virus","FIPV","Gene transcripts","healthy laboratory cats","normal cats","Analysis of KEGG","apoptosis","receptors","cytokine receptor interaction","InnateDB enrichment analysis","ADCC receptor","DC-SIGN","Th1 polarization overshadowed Th2 polarization","pattern of RNA expression","NK cell mediated cytotoxicity","addition of relevant B cell","host disease","chronic infectious diseases","allograft rejection","Jak-STAT","pathogen recognition","M1 type","macrophage death","certain autoimmune disorders","serotype","onset of lymphopenia","role","Fc\u03B3RIIIA","CD16A","weeks","Fold Change","fever","serositis","coronaviruses","immune complex","MHC","APN","populations","perception","DDP"],"language":"en"},

Prophylactic vaccination against HPV is an attractive strategy for preventing cervical cancer and some other types of cancers. However, there are few safe and effective vaccines against HPV infections. Current first-generation commercial HPV vaccines are expensive to produce and deliver. The goal of this study was to develop an alternate potent HPV recombinant L1-based vaccines by producing HPV virus-like particles into a vaccine that is currently used worldwide. Live attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccines have a well-established safety and efficacy record, and recombinant MV (rMV) produced by reverse genetics may be useful for generating candidate HPV vaccines to meet the needs of the developing world. We studied in non-human primate rMV-vectored HPV vaccine in parallel with a classical alum adjuvant recombinant HPV16L1 and 18L1 protein vaccine produced in Pichia pastoris. A combined prime-boost approach using both vaccines was evaluated, as well as immune interference due to pre-existing immunity against the MV. The humoral immune response induced by the MV, Pichia-expressed vaccine, and their combination as priming and boosting approaches was found to elicit HPV16L1 and 18L1 specific total IgG and neutralizing antibody titres. Pre-existing antibodies against measles did not prevent the immune response against HPV16L1 and 18L1.","publish_time":"2016-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gupta, Gaurav; Giannino, Viviana; Rishi, Narayan; Glueck, Reinhard","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/627b268e38efc54e037c978d2b578632b875f44f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126718.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16306491; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.07.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27523740/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16306491","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPV","MV","IgG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HPV virus","candidate HPV vaccines","HPV infections","recombinant MV","effective vaccines","Current first-generation commercial HPV vaccines","alternate potent HPV recombinant L1-based vaccines","non-human primate rMV-vectored HPV vaccine","18L1 protein vaccine","humoral immune response","immune interference","types of cancers","classical alum adjuvant recombinant HPV16L1","18L1 specific total IgG","Live attenuated measles virus","Pichia pastoris","pre-existing immunity","Pre-existing antibodies","primary causal agent of cervical cancer","Abstract Human papillomavirus","oncogenic small double-stranded DNA viruses","efficacy record","neutralizing antibody titres","attractive strategy","well-established safety","needs","vagina","vulva","HPVs","anus","reverse genetics","combined prime-boost approach","Prophylactic vaccination","oropharynx","study","approaches","combination","particles","transmitted disease","penis","developing world","goal"],"language":"en"},

Patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease are more likely to experience severe or critical COVID-19 illness and myocardial injury is a key extra-pulmonary manifestation. These patients frequently present with ST-elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) due to multiple etiologies including obstructive, non-obstructive, and/or angiographically normal coronary arteries. The incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) mimics in COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients, and the association with morbidity and mortality is unknown. Understanding the natural history and appropriate management of COVID-19 patients presenting with ST elevation is essential to inform patient management decisions and protect healthcare workers. Methods The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) and The Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology (CAIC) in conjunction with the American College of Cardiology Interventional Council have collaborated to create a multi-center observational registry, North American COVID-19 ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NACMI). This registry will enroll confirmed COVID-19 patients and persons under investigation (PUI) with new ST-segment elevation or new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the ECG with clinical suspicion of myocardial ischemia. We will compare demographics, clinical findings, outcomes and management of these patients with a historical control group of over 15,000 consecutive STEMI activation patients from the Midwest STEMI Consortium using propensity matching. The primary clinical outcome will be in- hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, recurrent MI, and repeat unplanned revascularization in COVID-19 confirmed or PUI. Secondary outcomes will include the following: reporting of etiologies of ST Elevation; cardiovascular mortality due to myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and /or shock; individual components of the primary outcome; composite primary outcome at one year; as well as ECG and angiographic characteristics. Conclusion The multicenter NACMI registry will collect data regarding ST elevation on ECG in COVID-19 patients to determine the etiology and associated clinical outcomes. The collaboration and speed with which this registry has been created, refined, and promoted serves as a template for future research endeavors.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dehghani, Payam; Davidson, Laura J.; Grines, Cindy L.; Nayak, Keshav; Saw, Jackie; Kaul, Prashant; Bagai, Akshay; Garberich, Ross; Schmidt, Christian; Ly MD SM, Hung Q.; Giri, Jay; Meraj, Perwaiz; Shah, Binita; Garcia, Santiago; Sharkey, Scott; Wood, David A.; Welt, Frederick G.; Mahmud, Ehtisham M.; Henry, Timothy D.","journal":"Am. heart j","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b753b14bddc3508938d5306cca01f877433d8b90.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2020.05.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002870320301423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425198/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870320301423?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ST","The Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology","American College of Cardiology Interventional Council","PUI","ST Elevation","ECG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ST-elevation","etiologies of ST Elevation","confirmed COVID","ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction","new ST-segment elevation","critical COVID","cardiovascular mortality","incidence of ST","appropriate management of COVID","ECG","North American COVID","cardiovascular disease","clinical outcomes","positive hospitalized patients","primary clinical outcome","consecutive STEMI activation patients","myocardial injury","Cardiovascular Angiography","clinical suspicion of myocardial ischemia","composite primary outcome","coronavirus disease","clinical findings","cardiovascular risk factors","multicenter NACMI registry","novel coronavirus","PUI","Secondary outcomes","hospital major adverse cardiovascular events","composite of all-cause mortality","Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology","multi-center observational registry","Midwest STEMI Consortium","patient management decisions","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","American College of Cardiology Interventional Council","new onset","multiple etiologies","MACE","mimics","recurrent MI","bundle branch block","stroke","LBBB","conjunction","CAIC","illness","data","historical control group","shock","key extra-pulmonary manifestation","Interventions","SCAI","individual components","cardiac arrest","investigation","persons","Abstract Background","healthcare workers","SARS-CoV","propensity matching","Society","unplanned revascularization","natural history","following","morbidity","angiographically normal coronary arteries","year","electrocardiogram","future research endeavors","template","Methods","Conclusion","demographics","etiology","collaboration","speed","angiographic characteristics","global pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Aim of the study is to determine neuroprotective effects of the musk of muskrat on focal cerebral ischemia. The protective effects against focal cerebral ischemia were evaluated using a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (90-minute occlusion followed by 24-hour reperfusion). Musk of muskrat was collected from scent bag of muskrat and orally administered at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg twice at times of 0 and 90 min after occlusion. The effects on sensorimotor dysfunction were investigated by using balance beam test and rotarod test after brain ischemia. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Oral administration of musk at 300 mg/kg significantly reduced (p\u003C0.001) the infarct volume by 32.4% compared with a vehicle-treated group. Oral administration of musk at 300 mg/kg also ameliorated ischemia-induced spontaneous and vestibule sensorimotor dysfunction in balance beam test and rotarod test compared with control group and COX-2 upregulation. Musk of muskrat may have neuroprotective effects against transient focal cerebral ischemia with recovery of sensorimotor dysfunction. Regarding the immunohistochemistry, the effects of muskrat may be due to anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of COX-2 expressions.","publish_time":"2019-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Donghun; Kim, Young-Sik; Song, Jungbin; Kim, Hocheol","journal":"Evid Based Complement Alternat Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e92385d74e531617394983f187f6b4c9ca2f328.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6614976.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/9817949; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341507/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Musk"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Musk of muskrat","Musk of musk deer","effects of muskrat","Oral administration of musk","neuroprotective effects","transient focal cerebral ischemia","rotarod test","brain ischemia","scent bag of muskrat","balance beam test","vestibule sensorimotor dysfunction","recovery of sensorimotor dysfunction","model of middle cerebral artery occlusion","stroke model","minute occlusion","inhibition of COX","immunohistochemistry","treatment of stroke","control group","vehicle-treated group","accessible substitute","Ondatra zibethicus","precious traditional medicinal materials","anti-inflammatory properties","upregulation","hour reperfusion","infarct volume","trading","expression of cyclooxygenase","expressions","study","doses","times"],"language":"en"},

Here, we sought to determine the prevalence of different respiratory viruses during asthma exacerbations. Systematic computerized searches of the literature up to June 2017 without language limitation were performed. The primary focus was on the prevalence of respiratory viruses, including AdV (adenovirus), BoV (bocavirus), CoV (coronavirus), CMV (cytomegalovirus), EnV (enterovirus), HSV (herpes simplex virus), IfV (influenza virus), MpV (metapneumovirus), PiV (parainfluenzavirus), RV (rhinovirus) and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) during asthma exacerbations. We also examined the prevalence of viral infection stratified by age, geographic region, type of respiratory secretion, and detection method. Sixty articles were included in the final analysis. During asthma exacerbations, the mean prevalence of AdV, BoV, CoV, CMV, EnV, HSV, IfV, MpV, PiV, RV and RSV was 3.8%, 6.9%, 8.4%, 7.2%, 10.1%, 12.3%, 10.0%, 5.3%, 5.6%, 42.1% and 13.6%, respectively. EnV, MPV, RV and RSV were more prevalent in children, whereas AdV, BoV, CoV, IfV and PiV were more frequently present in adults. RV was the major virus detected globally, except in Africa. RV could be detected in both the upper and lower airway. Polymerase chain reaction was the most sensitive method for detecting viral infection. Our findings indicate the need to develop prophylactic polyvalent or polyvirus (including RV, EnV, IfV and RSV) vaccines that produce herd immunity and reduce the healthcare burden associated with virus-induced asthma exacerbations.

In the main olfactory bulb (MOB), infection was observed in periglomerular, tufted, and mitral cells and in interneurons located in the internal plexiform layer. Beyond the MOB, CVS spread into the brain along the olfactory pathways. This infection is specific to chains of functionally related neurons but at the death of the animal some nuclei remain uninfected. CVS also penetrated the trigeminal system. The avirulent mutant AvOl, carrying a mutation in position 333 of the glycoprotein, infected the olfactory epithelium and the trigeminal nerve as efficiently as CVS. During the second cycle of infection, the mutant was able to infect efficiently periglomerular cells in the MOB and neurons of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, which indicates that maturation of infective particles is not affected in primarily infected neuronal cells. On the other hand, other neuronal cells permissive for CVS, such as mitral cells or the anterior olfactory nucleus, are completely free of infection with the mutant, indicating that restriction is related to the ability of AvO1 to penetrate several categories of neurons. From these observations, we concluded that CVS should be able to bind several different receptors to penetrate neurons, while the mutant would be unable to recognize some of them.","publish_time":"1991-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lafay, F.; Coulon, P.; Astic, L.; Saucier, D.; Riche, D.; Holley, A.; Flamand, A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7203ee00953dc742b847ad2d76e09b3be7ccb151.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682291901452; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682291901452","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mitral cells","periglomerular cells","infected olfactory receptor cells","infected neuronal cells","CVS strain","olfactory epithelium","olfactory pathways","neuronal cells permissive","MOB","related neurons","categories of neurons","free of infection","cycle of infection","anterior olfactory nucleus","main olfactory bulb","avirulent mutant AvOl","trigeminal nerve","trigeminal system","mouse","rabies virus","mutation","interneurons","horizontal limb","intranasal instillation","diagonal band","glycoprotein","death","chains","brain","animal","nuclei","internal plexiform layer","position","Abstract","maturation of infective particles","ability of AvO1","different receptors","hand","restriction","observations"],"language":"en"},

Global and temporal monitoring of predominant bacterial pathogens is important to inform new treatment strategies, vaccine development and to monitor the impact of vaccine implementation to improve progress toward global OM prevention. METHODS: A systematic review of published reports of microbiology of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) from January, 1970 to August 2014, was performed using PubMed databases. RESULTS: This review confirmed that Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, remain the predominant bacterial pathogens, with S. pneumoniae the predominant bacterium in the majority reports from AOM patients. In contrast, H. influenzae was the predominant bacterium for patients experiencing chronic OME, recurrent AOM and AOM with treatment failure. This result was consistent, even where improved detection sensitivity from the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) rather than bacterial culture was conducted. On average, PCR analyses increased the frequency of detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae 3.2 fold compared to culture, whilst Moraxella catarrhalis was 4.5 times more frequently identified by PCR. Molecular methods can also improve monitoring of regional changes in the serotypes and identification frequency of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae over time or after vaccine implementation, such as after introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae remain the predominant otopathogens associated with OM as identified through bacterial culture; however, molecular methods continue to improve the frequency and accuracy of detection of individual serotypes. Ongoing monitoring with appropriate detection methods for OM pathogens can support development of improved vaccines to provide protection from the complex combination of otopathogens within the middle ear, ultimately aiming to reduce the risk of chronic and recurrent OM in vulnerable populations.","publish_time":"2016-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ngo, Chinh C.; Massa, Helen M.; Thornton, Ruth B.; Cripps, Allan W.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94fc08607ba07e9f5a0239d27251d4cdcc6bfd9a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4783106.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26953891/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0150949","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae","Moraxella"],"organizations":["OM","AOM","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OM pathogens","recurrent OM","frequency of detection","predominant bacterium","bacterial culture","temporal monitoring of predominant bacterial pathogens","recurrent AOM","AOM patients","appropriate detection methods","vaccine development","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Haemophilus influenzae","Molecular methods","global OM prevention","accuracy of detection","acute otitis media","improved detection sensitivity","impact of vaccine implementation","multiple microbial pathogens","chronic OME","identification frequency","Ongoing monitoring","PCR analyses","middle ear","valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine","development of improved vaccines","monitoring of regional changes","majority reports","risk of chronic","treatment failure","individual serotypes","systematic review of published reports of microbiology","new treatment strategies","progress","use of polymerase chain reaction","protection","complex combination","introduction","vulnerable populations","fold","effusion","Moraxella catarrhalis","common childhood diseases","times","average","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","contrast","PubMed databases","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd \u003C 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV.","publish_time":"2020-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beck, Bo Ram; Shin, Bonggun; Choi, Yoonjung; Park, Sungsoo; Kang, Keunsoo","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5dd22f794a39c99d95a7487bacce2976a3662243.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ff54e3e961a72eb1d2500166809b3651b2f98cf6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.31.929547","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV","nM","effective treatment strategies","Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction","drug repurposing","inhibitory potency","MT-DTI model","Kd","ritonavir","prediction","pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model","lack of effective treatment options","list of antiviral drugs","Wuhan of China","available drugs","various strategies","viral proteins","antiviral agents","viral proteinases","HIV","best chemical compound","novel coronavirus","atazanavir","human immunodeficiency virus","darunavir","replication complex components","efavirenz","antiretroviral medication","real-world evidence","result","infection","study","Kaletra","lopinavir","dolutegravir","incidence rate","addition"],"language":"en"},

Since 1997, our neonatal ICUs (NICUs) had become endemic for MRSA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To control MRSA spread in our NICUs, we implemented a series of infection control measures stepwise, including reinforcement of hand hygiene since January 2000, augmentation of aseptic care over the insertion site of central venous catheter since July 2001, introduction of alcohol-based handrubs since April 2003, surveillance culture for MRSA and cohort care for the colonized patients between March 2003 and February 2004, and surveillance culture with subsequent decolonization of MRSA between August 2005 and July 2006. After implementation of these measures, MRSA healthcare-associated infection (HAI) density reduced by 92%, from 5.47 episodes per 1000 patient-days in 1999 to 0.45 episodes per 1000 patient-days in 2006; MRSA bloodstream infection reduced from 40 cases in 1999 to only one case in 2006. Compared to those obtained during the period of surveillance culture without decolonization, both rates of MRSA colonization (8.6% vs. 41%, p\u003C0.001) and infection (1.1% vs. 12%, p\u003C0.001) decreased significantly during the period of surveillance and decolonization. Molecular analysis of the clinical isolates during the study period showed that the endemic clone, which dominated between 1998 and 2005, almost disappeared in 2006, while the community clones increased significantly in 2006\u20132007. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Through infection control measures, MRSA HAIs can be successfully controlled, even in areas with high levels of endemic MRSA infections such as our NICUs.","publish_time":"2011-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Yhu-Chering; Lien, Rey-In; Su, Lin-Hui; Chou, Yi-Hong; Lin, Tzou-Yien","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72f81539c6237420551180793d727062bdd043bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3155524.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21857979/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MRSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MRSA HAIs","MRSA bloodstream infection","subsequent decolonization of MRSA","MRSA healthcare-associated infection","rates of MRSA colonization","period of surveillance culture","high levels of endemic MRSA infections","series of infection control measures","NICUs","cohort care","study period","endemic clone","patient-days","episodes","intensive care unit","augmentation of aseptic care","insertion site of central venous catheter","clinical isolates","important nosocomial pathogens","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","based handrubs","introduction of alcohol","BACKGROUND","reinforcement of hand hygiene","areas","cases","SIGNIFICANCE","colonized patients","Molecular analysis","density","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","CONCLUSION","implementation","neonatal ICUs","METHODOLOGY","community clones","Taiwan"],"language":"en"},

The main transmission route of this virus is thought to be via droplets, but airborne transmission has not been completely ruled out. METHODS: This is a contact tracing investigation of a young woman subsequently diagnosed with the 2009 H1N1 Influenza virus who was symptomatic during a long-distance bus trip from Spain to Switzerland. Fever and cough had begun 24 h earlier, 2 h before she stepped onto a bus for a long-distance trip. After the 2009 H1N1 virus had been confirmed in the patient, the other bus travellers were contacted by telephone on day 7 and 10 after the bus trip. RESULTS: Of the 72 individuals travelling on the bus with the H1N1-infected young woman, 52 (72%) could be contacted. Only one of these 52 developed fever, with onset of symptoms 3 days after the bus trip, and rRT-PCR analysis of the nasopharyngeal swab showed the infection to be caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus. One other person complained of coughing 1 day after the bus trip, but without fever, and no further investigation was carried out. All other passengers remained without fever, coughing, or arthralgia. The risk of transmission was calculated as 1.96% (95% confidence interval 0\u20135.76%). CONCLUSION: The transmission rate of 2009 H1N1 Influenza was low on a long-distance bus trip.

CIRD affected 66% (381/572) of the dogs studied, including both pet and kennelled dogs. Disease occurrence and severity were significantly reduced in dogs vaccinated against classic CIRD agents, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus 2 (CAV-2) and canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), but substantial proportions (65.7%; 201/306) of vaccinated dogs remained affected.

The current CV-A16 neutralization assay based on inhibition of cytopathic effects requires manual microscopic examination, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, a high-throughput neutralization assay was developed by employing CV-A16 pseudoviruses expressing luciferase for detecting infectivity in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and measuring serum viral neutralizing antibodies. Without the need to use infectious CV-A16 strains, the neutralizing antibody titer against CV-A16 could be determined within 15h by measuring luciferase signals by this assay. The pseudovirus CV-A16 neutralization assay (pCNA) was validated by comparison with a conventional CV-A16 neutralization assay (cCNA) in testing 174 human serum samples collected from children (age \u003C5 years). The neutralizing antibody titers determined by these two assays were well correlated (R 2 =0.7689).

It has been shown that apoptotic cells from blood and tissues may be involved in the complex pathogenesis of dengue. However, very little is known about the interplay between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic mediators in this disease. Therefore, plasma levels of the three proapoptotic mediators Fas ligand (FasL), tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03B1 (TNF\u2010\u03B1), and TNF\u2010related apoptosis\u2010inducing ligand (TRAIL) were measured in dengue patients. Patients were classified according to the World Health Organization classification of dengue revised in 2009. Additionally, inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAPs) were determined in plasma (Survivin) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) lysates (cIAP\u20101, cIAP\u20102, XIAP). Levels of apoptotic proteins in plasma were correlated with counts of blood cells. FasL and TRAIL levels were elevated in dengue patients without warning signs when compared to patients with severe dengue and controls. Dengue patients with warning signs showed decreased levels of Survivin compared to patients with severe dengue and controls. TRAIL was inversely correlated with counts of lymphocyte subsets. In contrast, Survivin was positively correlated with leukocyte counts. There was a trend of elevated IAPs levels in PBMCs of patients with severe dengue. The results suggest a likely antiviral effect of TRAIL in dengue. It appears that TRAIL might be involved with apoptosis induction of lymphocytes, whereas IAPs might participate in protecting leukocytes from apoptosis. Further research is needed to explore the interactions between pro and antiapoptotic molecules and their implications in dengue pathogenesis. J. Med.

It rapidly spread across the world and was classed as a global pandemic on 11 June 2009. OBJECTIVE: To analyse UK newsprint coverage of the swine flu pandemic. METHODS: Content analysis of 2374 newsprint articles published in eight UK national newspapers between 1 March 2009 and 28 February 2010. RESULTS: Newsprint coverage of the swine flu epidemic was immense. The threat from swine flu was portrayed as greatest in the spring and summer of 2009 when scientific uncertainties about the impact on the UK and global population were at their height and when swine flu cases in the UK first peaked. Thereafter the number of news articles waned, failing to mirror the October peak in flu cases as the virus failed to be as virulent as first feared. Content analysis found little evidence of the media \u2018over-hyping\u2019 the swine flu pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The news media\u0027s role as a disseminator of scientific information is particularly important in areas of risk perception. Despite a succession of health scares in recent years in which the media has been accused of exaggerating the risks and contributing to public misunderstandings of the issues, this analysis suggests that the UK newsprint reporting of swine flu in the 2009\u201310 outbreak was largely measured. The news media\u0027s role as disseminators of factual health information on swine flu is to be welcomed, particularly in relation to their handling and responsible reporting on scientific uncertainty.","publish_time":"2010-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hilton, Shona; Hunt, Kate","journal":"J Epidemiol Community Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed9bd29d43d2781618f8c3133dd85492af8960ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3171979.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21131303/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jech.2010.119875","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["swine flu pandemic","swine flu cases","swine flu epidemic","UK newsprint reporting of swine flu","UK newsprint coverage","newsprint articles","Content analysis","global pandemic","news media\u0027s role","UK national newspapers","disseminator of scientific information","scientific uncertainty","scientific uncertainties","number of news articles","spring","disseminators of factual health information","responsible reporting","global population","succession of health scares","over-hyping","little evidence","recent years","handling","impact","height","summer","virus","areas of risk perception","public misunderstandings","relation","issues","CONCLUSIONS","peak","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","Mexico","risks","threat","BACKGROUND","H1N1","world","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

First, based on the definition of the topological relations between two objects, we uncover a sequence of topological relations between two convex sets. Second, an extended model for topological relations between two sets is proposed based on the new definition. The topological relations between two convex sets are expressed as a sequence of 4\u00D74 matrices, which are the topological properties of Ao \u2229Bo, Ao\\B, Bo\\A, \u2202A\u2229\u2202B. The model is also extended for handling the properties of the topological relations between two non-convex sets, where the factor of first fundamental group is added to A\u222AB to handle these complex relations. The results show that the number of topological relations between the two sets is not as simple as finite but infinite and can be approximated by a sequence of matrices.","publish_time":"2007-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Kimfung; Shi, Wenzhong","journal":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdf72ec79c428a41c40154e2f2e0611a13837827.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0303243406000419; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243406000419","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sequence of topological relations","number of topological relations","complex relations","topological properties of Ao","non-convex sets","extended model","sequence of matrices","Bo","objects","new definition","factor","geographic information systems","GIS","finite","fundamental group","results","paper"],"language":"en"},

All these new viruses, as well as previously known respiratory viruses, can be detected by sensitive PCR methods, which have become popular in the diagnostic workup of respiratory viral infections. Currently, respiratory viruses can be detected in up to 95% of children with lower respiratory tract illness. On the other hand, virus detection rates in asymptomatic children are also high (up to 68%), as are coinfection rates in symptomatic children (up to 43%) and justified concerns of causality have been raised. Imposing progress has been made in developing multiplex quantitative PCR assays; here, several primer sets are run within a single PCR mixture. These PCR assays give a better understanding of the dominant viral infection, of viral infections that may be incipient and of any waning infections than does a single-target PCR. Multiplex PCR assays are also gaining popularity due to their cost-effectiveness and short throughput time compared to multiple single-target PCRs. Our understanding of the indications of virus PCRs and our ability to interpret the results from a clinical point of view have improved. This paper reviews the progress in PCR assays and discusses their role in the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections in children.","publish_time":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jartti, Tuomas; S\u00F6derlund-Venermo, Maria; Hedman, Klaus; Ruuskanen, Olli; M\u00E4kel\u00E4, Mika J.","journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b9b9b6a111287be412bfa36ddc3ba56ab471c4a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106250.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23347659/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054212000292; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prrv.2012.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054212000292","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Multiplex PCR assays","new respiratory viruses","single PCR mixture","multiplex quantitative PCR assays","diagnostic workup of respiratory viral infections","diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections","sensitive PCR methods","new viruses","lower respiratory tract illness","asymptomatic children","waning infections","multiple single-target PCRs","dominant viral infection","virus detection rates","indications of virus PCRs","better understanding","coinfection rates","Imposing progress","short throughput time","past decade","popularity","role","results","cost-effectiveness","ability","hand","primer sets","clinical point of view","subgroups","paper","justified concerns of causality","Summary"],"language":"en"},

Our results show that IgG1-biased humoral responses as well as high levels of GP-specific antibodies were beneficial for the control of EBOV infection after immunization.

Isothermal amplification of the matrix protein (M) gene of NDV and the nucleoprotein (N) gene of IBV was implemented via recombinase polymerase amplification at 38 \u00B0C for 40 min and 20 min, respectively using modified labeled primers. NALF device used in this study utilizes antibodies for detection of labeled RPA amplicons. The results revealed that RPA-NALF immunoassays can detect both viruses after 40 min at 38 \u00B0C and only NDV after 20 min. The limit of detection (LOD) was 10 genomic copies/RPA reaction. The assays results on clinical samples collected from diseased chicken farms demonstrated a good performance in comparison with quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The assays established in this study can facilitate rapid, on-site molecular diagnosis of suspected cases of ND and IB viral infections as the results can be detected by the naked eye without the need for measuring fluorescence. Furthermore, the NALF device could be adapted to detect other infectious agents.","publish_time":"2019-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"El-Tholoth, Mohamed; Branavan, Manoharanehru; Naveenathayalan, Angel; Balachandran, Wamadeva","journal":"Mol Biol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16b6624f7eb82ca63e757747457475780dbb2794.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7089497.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-019-05085-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31549369/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV","IBV","NALF","RPA","ND","IB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of NDV","Rapid detection","RPA reaction","RPA-NALF immunoassays","gene of NDV","study","NALF device","results","detection of labeled RPA amplicons","gene of IBV","limit of detection","field applicable recombinase polymerase amplification","Isothermal amplification","viruses","infectious bronchitis virus","infectious agents","quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","Newcastle disease virus","modified labeled primers","comparison","good performance","nucleic acid lateral flow","molecular diagnosis of suspected cases of ND","diseased chicken farms","antibodies","IB viral infections","respiratory tract of chickens","clinical samples","poultry pathogens","qRT-PCR","nucleoprotein","major economic losses","matrix protein","genomic copies","implementation of appropriate control measures","LOD","need","industry","naked eye","fluorescence","objective"],"language":"en"},

Efficacy endpoints in influenza clinical trials may include clinical symptoms and virological measurements, although virology cannot serve as the primary endpoint. We investigated the relationship between influenza A RNA copy number and quantity of infectious viruses in hospitalized influenza patients. Methods. One hundred fifty influenza-infected, hospitalized patients were included in this prospective cohort study spanning the 2012\u20132013 influenza season. Daily nasopharyngeal samples were collected during hospitalization, and influenza A RNA copy number and infectious viral titer were monitored. Results. The decay rate for 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) was 0.51 \u00B1 0.14 log(10) TCID(50)/mL per day, whereas the RNA copy number decreased at a rate of 0.41 \u00B1 0.04 log(10) copies/mL per day (n = 433). The log ratio of the RNA copy number to the infectious viral titer within patient changes significantly with \u22120.25 \u00B1 0.09 units per day (P = .0069). For a 12-day observation period, the decay corresponds to a decline of this ratio of 3 log influenza RNA copies. Conclusions.

RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, up to a million times higher than that of their hosts. Virus mutagenic capability depends upon several factors, including the fidelity of viral enzymes that replicate nucleic acids, as SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability, thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. METHODS: We analyzed 220 genomic sequences from the GISAID database derived from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide from December 2019 to mid-March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was obtained from the GenBank database. Genomes alignment was performed using Clustal Omega. Mann\u2013Whitney and Fisher-Exact tests were used to assess statistical significance. RESULTS: We characterized 8 novel recurrent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, located at positions 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403 and 28881. Mutations in 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 positions are predominantly observed in Europe, whereas those located at positions 17746, 17857 and 18060 are exclusively present in North America. We noticed for the first time a silent mutation in RdRp gene in England (UK) on February 9th, 2020 while a different mutation in RdRp changing its amino acid composition emerged on February 20th, 2020 in Italy (Lombardy). Viruses with RdRp mutation have a median of 3 point mutations [range: 2\u20135], otherwise they have a median of 1 mutation [range: 0\u20133] (p value \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the virus is evolving and European, North American and Asian strains might coexist, each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern. The contribution of the mutated RdRp to this phenomenon needs to be investigated. To date, several drugs targeting RdRp enzymes are being employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment. Some of them have a predicted binding moiety in a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp hydrophobic cleft, which is adjacent to the 14408 mutation we identified. Consequently, it is important to study and characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp mutation in order to assess possible drug-resistance viral phenotypes. It is also important to recognize whether the presence of some mutations might correlate with different SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pachetti, Maria; Marini, Bruna; Benedetti, Francesca; Giudici, Fabiola; Mauro, Elisabetta; Storici, Paola; Masciovecchio, Claudio; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Gallo, Robert C.; Zella, Davide; Ippodrino, Rudy","journal":"J Transl Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b43559b44f0423915513c0eb2d49b9d10e76aba6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7174922.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32321524/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02344-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","GenBank","Clustal Omega"],"locations":["Europe","North America"],"keyphrases":["RdRp mutation","different SARS-CoV","RdRp enzymes","silent mutation","RdRp gene","mutated RdRp","different mutation pattern","high mutation rate","novel recurrent mutations of SARS","RNA viruses","RdRp hydrophobic cleft","positions","RNA dependent RNA polymerase","point mutations","viral evolution","fidelity of viral enzymes","drug resistance","RNA coronavirus responsible","median","range","possible drug-resistance viral phenotypes","genome variability","reference genome","GISAID database","GenBank database","North America","Virus mutagenic capability","pandemic","order","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","nucleic acids","factors","England","Fisher-Exact tests","Whitney","COVID","genomic sequences","Asian strains","host immunity","amino acid composition","patients","predicted binding moiety","mortality rates","Genomes alignment","Clustal Omega","Mann","UK","date","drugs","infection treatment","statistical significance","times higher","hosts","METHODS","RESULTS","findings","contribution","phenomenon","presence","Europe","BACKGROUND","Italy","Lombardy","p value","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We determined the minimal mechanism of helicase function by nsp13. We showed a clear unwinding lag with increasing length of the double-stranded region of the nucleic acid, suggesting the presence of intermediates in the unwinding process. To elucidate the nature of the intermediates we carried out transient kinetic analysis of the nsp13 helicase activity. We demonstrated that the enzyme unwinds nucleic acid in discrete steps of 9.3 base-pairs (bp) each, with a catalytic rate of 30 steps per second. Therefore the net unwinding rate is \u223C280 base-pairs per second. We also showed that nsp12, the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), enhances (2-fold) the catalytic efficiency of nsp13 by increasing the step size of nucleic acid (RNA/RNA or DNA/DNA) unwinding. This effect is specific for SARS-CoV nsp12, as no change in nsp13 activity was observed when foot-and-mouth-disease virus RdRp was used in place of nsp12. Our data provide experimental evidence that nsp13 and nsp12 can function in a concerted manner to improve the efficiency of viral replication and enhance our understanding of nsp13 function during SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.","publish_time":"2012-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adedeji, Adeyemi O.; Marchand, Bruno; te Velthuis, Aartjan J.

Results Data was collected from 31 TB cases, 65.4% (17/26) were Saudi residents. Sputum culture was the only diagnostic test applied in 67.7% (21/31) of patients. Most (96.8%, 30/31) confirmed TB cases were isolated, but only 12.9% (4/28) were tested for HIV and merely 37% (10/27) received the recommended four 1st-line anti-TB drugs.

Moreover, t-tests and one-way analysis of variance showed that nurses received higher scores than doctors, female participants received higher scores than male participants, and the participants with low professional title and high contact frequency, aged between 20 years and 30 years, with less than five years of work experience, having not received related training and with no related experience obtained higher PCL-C scores than the others (P \u003C 0.05, P \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSION: The PTSD level of doctors and nurses after their exposure to H7N9 patients was high, which warrant further research. Health and medical institutions should pay attention to the physical and psychological health of these staff members.","publish_time":"2016-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Liling; Pan, Lingling; Yuan, Liping; Zha, Lei","journal":"Int J Nurs Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b44eb4e309e0a843a7c308eeddab0e852704a19.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f79cb6c46151a0af6270805ed459f6e9bc95e031.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6626070.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352013216300953; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352013216300953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31406720/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnss.2016.12.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nurses","scores of doctors","PTSD level of doctors","PTSD symptoms","higher scores","tested doctors","H7N9 patients","higher PCL-C scores","related experience","related training","psychological health","staff members","female participants","PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version","mean PCL-C score","H7N9 influenza epidemic","medical staff workers","years of work experience","related factors of post-traumatic stress disorder","high contact frequency","professional titles","medical institutions","respiratory department","emergency department","low professional title","different genders","ages","attention","one-way analysis of variance","trainings","frequencies","prevalence","exposure","intensive care unit","self-reported questionnaire","experiences","t-tests","METHOD","sample","convenient sampling","CONCLUSION","scientific basis","study","differences","OBJECTIVE","research","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, an obligatory step in the virus life cycle is the delivery of the viral genome inside the cell. Enveloped viruses (i.e., viruses with a lipid envelope) use a two-step procedure to release their genetic material into the cell: (i) they first bind to specific surface receptors of the target cell membrane and then, (ii) they fuse the viral and cell membranes. This last step may occur at the cell surface or after internalization of the virus particle by endocytosis or by some other route (e.g., macropinocytosis). Remarkably, the virus-cell membrane fusion process goes essentially along the same intermediate steps as other membrane fusions that occur for instance in vesicular fusion at the nerve synapsis or cell-cell fusion in yeast mating. Specialized viral proteins, fusogens, promote virus-cell membrane fusion. The viral fusogens experience drastic structural rearrangements during fusion, liberating the energy required to overcome the repulsive forces that prevent spontaneous fusion of the two membranes. This chapter describes the different types of viral fusogens and their mode of action, as are currently known.","publish_time":"2013-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00E1s, Vicente; Melero, Jos\u00E9 A.","journal":"Structure and Physics of Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e4d9d29176038bdec003144a1d0c749c6b48a231.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121288.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-6552-8_16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23737062/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Specialized"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-cell fusion","cell surface","cell membranes","virus-cell membrane fusion process","target cell membrane","vesicular fusion","spontaneous fusion","viral genome","virus particle","membrane fusions","different types of viral","Specialized viral proteins","virus life cycle","Enveloped viruses","obligatory step","specific surface receptors","nerve synapsis","experience drastic structural rearrangements","two-step procedure","delivery","instance","internalization","cellular machinery","intracellular parasites","lipid envelope","endocytosis","repulsive forces","energy","genetic material","yeast mating","intermediate steps","chapter","mode of action","route","replication","macropinocytosis"],"language":"en"},

ARDS occurs most often in the setting of pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents or severe trauma, and is present in ~10% of all intensive care unit patients worldwide. Despite some improvements over the past decades, mortality remains high at 30\u201340% in most studies. Pathologic specimens from patients with ARDS most frequently reveal diffuse alveolar damage, and laboratory studies have demonstrated both alveolar epithelial and lung endothelial injury, resulting in accumulation of protein-rich inflammatory edema fluid in the alveolar space. Diagnosis is based on consensus syndromic criteria, with recent proposed modifications for under-resourced settings and for pediatric patients. Patient management focuses on implementing a lung-protective ventilation strategy; no specific pharmacotherapies have been identified. Long-term outcomes of patients with ARDS are increasingly recognized as important research targets, as many patients survive ARDS only to suffer ongoing functional and/or psychologic sequelae.

Both NDV\u2010induced oxidative damage and protective role of novel phosphorylated ABC\u20101 were evaluated in vital organs such as the liver and lung of chickens. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that protein oxidation and nitration levels were significantly raised in NDV\u2010infected tissues compared to healthy controls, whereas these levels were reduced significantly (P \u003C 0.05) in birds treated with phosphorylated compounds compared to the NDV\u2010infected group alone.

Previously, by comparing serotype II strains FIPV 79-1146 and FECV 79-1683 and recombinant chimeric forms thereof in cultured feline bone marrow macrophages, we mapped this difference to the C-terminal part of the viral spike (S) protein (S2). In view of the later identified diagnostic difference in this very part of the S protein of serotype I FCoV pathotypes, the present study aimed to further define the contribution of the earlier observed ten amino acids difference to the serotype II virus phenotype in macrophages. Using targeted RNA recombination as a reverse genetics system we introduced the mutations singly and in combinations into the S gene and evaluated their effects on the infection characteristics of the mutant viruses in macrophages. While some of the single mutations had a significant effect, none of them fully reverted the infection phenotype. Only by combining five specific mutations the infections mediated by the FIPV and FECV spike proteins could be fully blocked or potentiated, respectively.

We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike\u2019s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus.

Here, we utilized small RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses to characterize miRNA expression profiles in the liver of domestic cats at 7 days after oral infection with T. gondii (Type II) strain. A total of 384 miRNAs were identified and 82 were differentially expressed, of which 33 were up-regulated and 49 down-regulated. Also, 5690 predicted host gene targets for the differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using the bioinformatic algorithm miRanda. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the predicted gene targets of the dysregulated miRNAs were significantly enriched in apoptosis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that the predicted gene targets were involved in several pathways, including acute myeloid leukemia, central carbon metabolism in cancer, choline metabolism in cancer, estrogen signaling pathway, fatty acid degradation, lysosome, nucleotide excision repair, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and VEGF signaling pathway. The expression level of 6 upregulated miRNAs (mmu-miR-21a-5p, mmu-miR-20a-5p, mmu-miR-17-5p, mmu-miR-30e-3p, mmu-miR-142a-3p, and mmu-miR-106b-3p) was confirmed by stem-loop quantitative reverse transcription PCR, which yielded results consistent with the sequencing data.

METHODS: OVA sensitized BALB/c mice were challenged with aerosolized OVA on days 28 to 30, 34, 41 and 63. Mice were intranasal treated with BCG on days 35 and 42. Twenty-four hours after the last challenge, blood samples were collected to detect anti-OVA immunoglobulin isotypes, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was harvested for cell count. Additionally, lungs were collected for histological analysis, detection of the eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activity and measurement of cytokines and CCL11. The expression of CTLA-4, Foxp3 and IL-10 was also determined in lung tissue by flow cytometry. RESULTS: BCG treatment was able to inhibit an established allergic Th2-response, by decreasing the allergen-induced eosinophilic inflammation, EPO activity, levels of CCL11 and IL-4, serum levels of IgE and IgG1. Mycobacteria treatment increased lung levels of IFN-\u03B3, IL-10 and TGF-\u03B2, and expressions of Foxp3 and CTLA-4 in CD4(\u002B)T cells. Additionally, an increased production of IL-10 by CD8(\u002B) T cells was observed, even though no detectable changes in CD4(\u002B)IL-10(\u002B) was noticed. CONCLUSION: BCG treatment inhibits features of allergic airway inflammation and the results suggest that the mechanism underlying the down-regulatory effects of BCG on OVA-induced airway inflammation appear to be associated with the induction of both Th1 and T regulatory immune responses.","publish_time":"2012-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gouveia, Ana Cl\u00E1udia Carvalho; Brugiolo, Alessa Sin Singer; Alves, Caio C\u00E9sar Souza; Silva, Fl\u00E1via M\u00E1rcia Castro; Mesquita, Felipe Pereira; Gameiro, Jacy; Ferreira, Ana Paula","journal":"J Clin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72ceb06d0b4409dda06adb1d24bec24a42b0db96.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086714.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22864629/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-012-9746-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BCG treatment","OVA-induced airway inflammation","established allergic airway inflammation","features of allergic airway inflammation","aerosolized OVA","eosinophilic inflammation","OVA sensitized BALB","regulatory effects of BCG","increased production of IL","levels of CCL11","T cells","Mycobacteria treatment increased lung levels of IFN","EPO activity","anti-OVA immunoglobulin isotypes","c mice","CD4","RESULTS","days","established allergic Th2-response","T regulatory immune responses","serum levels of IgE","lung tissue","expressions of Foxp3","expression of CTLA","c mouse model of ovalbumin","eosinophil peroxidase","Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00E9rin","bronchoalveolar lavage","detection","Th1","histological analysis","measurement of cytokines","blood samples","TGF-\u03B2","allergen","METHODS","CD8","challenge","study","flow cytometry","IgG1","mechanism","induction","CONCLUSION","detectable changes","cell count","hours","lungs","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

In total, 580 individuals were presented with a questionnaire. A significant proportion of individuals had chronic medical disorders, e.g. diabetes mellitus (132, 22.8%) and hypertension (147, 25.3%). Pilgrims had a low level of education and a low employment rate. Sixty (10.3%) were treated with statins for hypercholesterolemia. Four hundred and fourty-seven pilgrims were presented a questionnaire on returning home. A total of 74 travellers (16.6%) experienced fever during their stay in Saudi Arabia (67 attended a doctor) and 271 (60.6%) had cough (259 attended a doctor); 70 travellers with cough were febrile (25.9%). Seventy per cent of the travellers who suffered cough episodes developed their first symptoms within 3 days, suggesting a human to human transmission of the responsible pathogen, with short incubation time as evidenced by a bimodal distribution of cough in two peaks at a 24 h interval. None of demographical and socioeconomic characteristics, underlying diseases or vaccination against influenza significantly affected the occurrence of cough. Diabetes correlated with an increased risk of febrile cough (OR = 2.02 (1.05\u20133.89)) as well as unemployment (OR = 2.22 (0.91\u20135.53)). Use of statins had no significant influence on the occurrence of cough and/or fever during the pilgrimage. This result suggests that while treatment with a statin has been demonstrated to reduce the mortality from severe sepsis associated with respiratory tract infections, it probably does not play a role in the outcome of regular febrile cough episodes as observed in the cohort studied here.","publish_time":"2009-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gautret, P.; Yong, W.; Soula, G.; Gaudart, J.; Delmont, J.; Dia, A.; Parola, P.; Brouqui, P.","journal":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4e0e3408b8be8fabde40e804af36d5d0ee3078b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128324.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02816.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19416305/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14603943; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14603943","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["occurrence of cough","incidence of febrile cough episodes","increased risk of febrile cough","bimodal distribution of cough","outcome of regular febrile cough episodes","travellers","Saudi Arabia","significant influence","Pilgrims","doctor","use of statin","questionnaire","statins","total","significant proportion of individuals","human transmission","experienced fever","diabetes mellitus","Hajj pilgrimage","low level of education","low employment rate","adult Muslims","chronic medical disorders","responsible pathogen","underlying diseases","vaccination","Marseille","severe sepsis","socioeconomic characteristics","short incubation time","peaks","influenza","respiratory tract infections","stay","mortality","days","symptoms","prospective epidemiological study","h interval","treatment","cent","cohort","result","hypertension","home","hypercholesterolemia","fourty","unemployment"],"language":"en"},

Methods We performed a search on ClinicalTrials.gov using the independent search terms COVID-19, SARS, and SARS COV2, and then downloaded the data file on March 23, 2020. All trials were downloaded to a csv file and searched for appropriateness. Results Fifty-six of 124 (45.2%) registered trials were listed as recruiting. The majority (85, 68.5%) classified their study as interventional, 37 (29.8%) classified as observational and one (0.8%) each classified their study as either expanded access:individual patients | treatment IND/Protocol or expanded access:intermediate-size population | treatment IND/Protocol. There were 67 (54.0%) of the trials that listed drug as the type of study. Immunological and antiviral trials were the greatest, representing approximately 30% and 21%, respectively. When immunological and antiviral drugs were used alone or in combination, they represented 41.9% and 34.4%, respectively. Anti-malarial agents are represented in 7.5% of trials. Approximately 14% of trials involved Traditional Chinese Medicine. The aforementioned study agents used solely or in combination represented approximately 80% of therapeutic approaches to COVID19. Conclusion There was a large and quick response on ClinicalTrials.gov to the COVID-19 outbreak. Many of the registered trials are currently recruiting new patients, while some will begin in the near future. Specific potential experimental therapies, including dosing and monitoring, might be found by reviewing content. Within clinicaltrials.gov, patients, family members, health care professionals and researchers can search and find ongoing and future trials for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mousa, Albeir Y.; Broce, Mike; Lucas, B.

Objectives In this study, we investigate whether, the use of a respiratory symptom screening tool at the border would aid in predicting which travellers are more likely to be infected with specific respiratory viruses. Study design Data were collected from travellers arriving at Christchurch International Airport, New Zealand, during the winter 2008, via a symptom questionnaire, temperature testing, and respiratory sampling. Results Respiratory viruses were detected in 342 (26.0%) of 1313 samples obtained from 2714 symptomatic travellers. The most frequently identified viruses were rhinoviruses (128), enteroviruses (77) and influenza B (48). The most frequently reported symptoms were stuffy or runny nose (60%), cough (47%), sore throat (27%) and sneezing (24%). Influenza B infections were associated with the highest number of symptoms (mean of 3.4) followed by rhinoviruses (mean of 2.2) and enteroviruses (mean of 1.9). The positive predictive value (PPV) of any symptom for any respiratory virus infection was low at 26%. Conclusions The high prevalence of respiratory virus infections caused by viruses other than influenza in this study, many with overlapping symptotology to influenza, has important implications for any screening strategies for the prediction of influenza in airline travellers.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jennings, Lance C.; Priest, Patricia C.; Psutka, Rebecca A.; Duncan, Alasdair R.; Anderson, Trevor; Mahagamasekera, Patalee; Strathdee, Andrew; Baker, Michael G.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2724bbc3815715629f28e471c6e4ba9fd7a557f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106445.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665321500089X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665321500089X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25959149/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.03.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Christchurch International Airport"],"locations":["New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["specific respiratory viruses","distribution of respiratory viruses","respiratory sampling","respiratory symptom screening tool","prediction of influenza","airline travellers","symptomatic travellers","identified viruses","Influenza B infections","high prevalence of respiratory virus infections","international air travellers","symptom questionnaire","screening strategies","rhinoviruses","enteroviruses","Study design Data","reported symptoms","Christchurch International Airport","highest number of symptoms","important implications","New Zealand","temperature testing","border","runny nose","overlapping symptotology","PPV","winter","Conclusions","positive predictive value","Abstract Background","sore throat","cough","samples","sneezing","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Often, this path starts with innovation from academic collaborations amongst biologists, chemists, and engineers, followed by the formation of a start-up company driving clinical translation and approval. An early wave featured injectable (i.e., intramuscular, subcutaneous) biodegradable polymeric microspheres to control drug release profiles for peptides and small molecules (e.g., Lupron Depot\u00AE, Risperdal Consta\u00AE). With these early successes for microspheres, research shifted to exploring systemic delivery by intravenous injection, which required smaller particle sizes and modified surface properties (e.g., PEGylation) to enable long circulation times. These new innovations resulted in the nanoparticle medicines Doxil\u00AE and Abraxane\u00AE, designed to improve the therapeutic index of cytotoxic cancer agents by decreasing systemic exposure and delivering more drug to tumors. Very recently, the first siRNA lipid nanoparticle medicine, Patisiran (Onpattro\u00AE), was approved for treating hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.

During the past few years, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods have been developed for many pathogens causing respiratory tract infections. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of CAP among adults\u2014especially the occurrence of mixed infections among patients with CAP\u2014by implementing a new diagnostic PCR platform combined with conventional methods. METHODS: Adults admitted to Karolinska University Hospital were studied prospectively during a 12-month period. Microbiological testing methods included culture from blood, sputum, and nasopharyngeal secretion samples; sputum samples analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; nasopharyngeal specimens analyzed by use of PCR; serological testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and viruses common in the respiratory tract; and urine antigen assays for detection of pneumococcal and Legionella pneumophila antigens. RESULTS: A microbial etiology could be identified for 67% of the patients (n = 124). For patients with complete sampling, a microbiological agent was identified for 89% of the cases. The most frequently detected pathogens were S. pneumoniae (70 patients [38]) and respiratory virus (53 patients [29]). Two or more pathogens were present in 43 (35%) of 124 cases with a determined etiology. CONCLUSIONS: By supplementing traditional diagnostic methods with new PCR-based methods, a high microbial yield was achieved. This was especially evident for patients with complete sampling. Mixed infections were frequent (most commonly S. pneumoniae together with a respiratory virus).","publish_time":"2010-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johansson, Niclas; Kalin, Mats; Tiveljung-Lindell, Annika; Giske, Christian G.; Hedlund, Jonas","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ea5fa169af0ff808d3437e08a5146c8766121d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107844.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20014950/; https://doi.org/10.1086/648678","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chlamydophila pneumoniae","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":["Karolinska University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","new PCR-based methods","conventional methods","etiology of CAP","Microbiological testing methods","use of PCR","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","traditional diagnostic methods","respiratory tract infections","respiratory virus","microbial etiology of community","new diagnostic PCR platform","determined etiology","real-time quantitative PCR","sputum samples","adults","complete sampling","occurrence of mixed infections","detected pathogens","cases","nasopharyngeal secretion samples","high microbial yield","nasopharyngeal specimens","serological testing","microbiological agent","detection of pneumococcal","Haemophilus influenzae","blood","urine antigen assays","Moraxella catarrhalis","polymerase chain reaction","viruses common","years","culture","Legionella pneumophila antigens","past","Karolinska University Hospital","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","study","RESULTS","month period","aim"],"language":"en"},

The innate immune response to viruses requires their early detection through pathogen recognition receptors and the recruitment of the efficient antiviral response that is centred around the release of type 1 interferons.

Invasive alien plants species (IAPS) are considered to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss and thereby altering the ecosystem services and socio-economic conditions through different mechanisms. Although the ecological impacts of IAPS are well documented, there is a dearth of studies regarding their economic quantification, livelihood considerations, biotechnological prospects (phytoremediation, bioenergy, phyto-synthesis of nanoparticles, biomedical, industrial applications etc.) and human health risk assessments of IAPS. In this context, the current panoramic review aimed to investigate the environmental, socio-ecological and health risks posed by IAPS as well as the compounded impact of IAPS with habitat fragmentation, climate and land use changes. To this end, the need of an integrated trans-disciplinary research is emphasized for the sustainable management of IAPS. The management prospects can be further strengthened through their linkage with geo-spatial technologies (remote sensing and GIS) by mapping and monitoring the IAPS spread. Further, the horizon of IAPS management is expanded to ecological indicator perspectives of IAPS, biosecurity, and risk assessment protocols with critical discussion. Moreover, positive as well as negative implications of the IAPS on environment, health, ecosystem services and socio-economy (livelihood) are listed so that a judicious policy framework could be developed for the IAPS management in order to mitigate the human health implications.","publish_time":"2020-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar Rai, Prabhat; Singh, J.S.","journal":"Ecol Indic","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4726c1f03a2d8471f2ca43d6ccb0d3037a313859.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2e75fa80bd3f3ac76fc0f1d5f0aa92987468e613.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194640.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32372880/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X19310167; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.106020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1470160X19310167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAPS","GIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ecological impacts of IAPS","sustainable management of IAPS","horizon of IAPS management","compounded impact of IAPS","ecological indicator perspectives of IAPS","human health risk assessments of IAPS","socio-ecological","management prospects","human health implications","health risks","Ecological perturbations","ecosystem services","livelihood considerations","biotechnological prospects","socio-economy","negative implications","risk assessment protocols","habitat fragmentation","phytoremediation","biosecurity","remote sensing","economic quantification","nanoparticles","phyto-synthesis","bioenergy","climate","industrial applications","geo-spatial technologies","environment","need","GIS","integrated trans-disciplinary research","socio-economic conditions","land use changes","order","different mechanisms","linkage","dearth of studies","critical discussion","Invasive alien plants species","mapping","major drivers of biodiversity loss","current panoramic review","growing threat","biotic invasion","global sustainability","context","judicious policy framework","end"],"language":"en"},

KSA started introducing decisive social distancing measures early before the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Kingdom. These ranged from suspension or cancelations of religious, entertainment and sporting mass gatherings and events such as the Umrah, temporary closure of educational establishments and mosques and postponing all non-essential gatherings, to imposing a curfew. These measures were taken in spite of their socio-economic, political and religious challenges in the interest of public and global health. The effect of these actions on the epidemic curve of the Kingdom and on the global fight against COVID-19 remains to be seen. However, given the current COVID-19 situation, further bold and probably unpopular measures are likely to be introduced in the future.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yezli, Saber; Khan, Anas","journal":"Travel Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9dce8df2b341c24b4c78f34616dc69a80c165bac.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9c1d59d46225d3eb57616c5c302bfa51ec318612.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172679.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920301605?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101692; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1477893920301605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KSA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["decisive social distancing measures","religious norms","religious challenges","cancelations of religious","unpopular measures","transmission of COVID","case of COVID","current COVID","sporting mass gatherings","KSA","implementation of strict measures","annual hosting of high visibility international religious mass gatherings","non-essential gatherings","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","global fight","global health","mosques","entertainment","Umrah","events","temporary closure of educational establishments","various levels","key measure","situation","epidemic curve","level of urbanization","actions","spite","suspension","effect","curfew","future"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To provide a contemporary picture of the risks from delayed treatment for urologic cancers to assist with triage. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A collaborative review using literature published as of April 2, 2020. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Patients with low-grade non\u2013muscle-invasive bladder cancer are unlikely to suffer from a 3\u20136-month delay. Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer are at risk of disease progression, with radical cystectomy delays beyond 12 wk from diagnosis or completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Prioritization of these patients for surgery or management with radiochemotherapy is encouraged. Active surveillance should be used for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Treatment of most patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa can be deferred 3\u20136 mo without change in outcomes. The same may be true for cancers with the highest risk of progression. With radiotherapy, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care. For surgery, although the added value of neoadjuvant ADT is questionable, it may be considered if a patient is interested in such an approach. Intervention may be safely deferred for T1/T2 renal masses, while locally advanced renal tumors (\u2265T3) should be treated expeditiously. Patients with metastatic renal cancer may consider vascular endothelial growth factor targeted therapy over immunotherapy. Risks for delay in the treatment of upper tract urothelial cancer depend on grade and stage. For patients with high-grade disease, delays of 12 wk in nephroureterectomy are not associated with adverse survival outcomes. Expert guidance recommends expedient local treatment of testis cancer. In penile cancer, adverse outcomes have been observed with delays of \u22653 mo before inguinal lymphadenectomy. Limitations include a paucity of data and methodologic variations for many cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and clinicians should consider the oncologic risk of delayed cancer intervention versus the risks of COVID-19 to the patient, treating health care professionals, and the health care system. PATIENT SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to delays in the treatment of patients with urologic malignancies. Based on a review of the literature, patients with high-grade urothelial carcinoma, advanced kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and penile cancer should be prioritized for treatment during these challenging times.","publish_time":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wallis, Christopher J.D.; Novara, Giacomo; Marandino, Laura; Bex, Axel; Kamat, Ashish M.; Karnes, R.

There are conflicting reports on the animal reservoir of SARS\u2010CoV. Many of the groups that argue carnivores are the original reservoir of SARS\u2010CoV use a phylogeny to support their argument. However, the phylogenies in these studies often lack outgroup and rooting criteria necessary to determine the origins of SARS\u2010CoV. Recently, SARS\u2010CoV has been isolated from various species of Chiroptera from China (e.g., Rhinolophus sinicus) thus leading to reconsideration of the original reservoir of SARS\u2010CoV. We evaluated the hypothesis that SARS\u2010CoV isolated from Chiroptera are the original zoonotic source for SARS\u2010CoV by sampling SARS\u2010CoV and non\u2010SARS\u2010CoV from diverse hosts including Chiroptera, as well as carnivores, artiodactyls, rodents, birds and humans. Regardless of alignment parameters, optimality criteria, or isolate sampling, the resulting phylogenies clearly show that the SARS\u2010CoV was transmitted to small carnivores well after the epidemic of SARS in humans that began in late 2002. The SARS\u2010CoV isolates from small carnivores in Shenzhen markets form a terminal clade that emerged recently from within the radiation of human SARS\u2010CoV. There is evidence of subsequent exchange of SARS\u2010CoV between humans and carnivores. In addition SARS\u2010CoV was transmitted independently from humans to farmed pigs (Sus scrofa). The position of SARS\u2010CoV isolates from Chiroptera are basal to the SARS\u2010CoV clade isolated from humans and carnivores. Although sequence data indicate that Chiroptera are a good candidate for the original reservoir of SARS\u2010CoV, the structural biology of the spike protein of SARS\u2010CoV isolated from Chiroptera suggests that these viruses are not able to interact with the human variant of the receptor of SARS\u2010CoV, angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In SARS\u2010CoV we study, both visually and statistically, labile genomic fragments and, putative key mutations of the spike protein that may be associated with host shifts. We display host shifts and candidate mutations on trees projected in virtual globes depicting the spread of SARS\u2010CoV. These results suggest that more sampling of coronaviruses from diverse hosts, especially Chiroptera, carnivores and primates, will be required to understand the genomic and biochemical evolution of coronaviruses, including SARS\u2010CoV. \u00A9 The Willi Hennig Society 2008.","publish_time":"2008-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Janies, Daniel; Habib, Farhat; Alexandrov, Boyan; Hill, Andrew; Pol, Diego","journal":"Cladistics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0de1d8065345d00fb504867c7720a8487cfd0377.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162247.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00199.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313363/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chiroptera","SARS","Willi Hennig Society"],"locations":["China","Shenzhen"],"keyphrases":["sampling SARS","non\u2010SARS","origins of SARS","receptor of SARS","spread of SARS","epidemic of SARS","position of SARS","addition SARS","CoV isolates","CoV clade","original reservoir of SARS","animal reservoir of SARS","spike protein of SARS","radiation of human SARS","evidence of subsequent exchange of SARS","humans","small carnivores","various species of Chiroptera","sampling of coronaviruses","candidate mutations","isolate sampling","original zoonotic source","diverse hosts","human variant","host shifts","novel human illness","optimality criteria","good candidate","terminal clade","resulting phylogenies","putative key mutations","rooting criteria necessary","biochemical evolution of coronaviruses","labile genomic fragments","Shenzhen markets","trees","virtual globes","structural biology","outgroup","China","angiotensin","reconsideration","unrecognized coronavirus","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","studies","artiodactyls","rodents","birds","alignment parameters","Rhinolophus sinicus","conflicting reports","pigs","Sus scrofa","enzyme","phylogeny","sequence data","Willi Hennig Society","ACE2","results","groups","primates","hypothesis","argument"],"language":"en"},

Markov matrices provide a convenient way to perform contaminant transport analysis. However, no standardized method exists for calculating these matrices. A methodology based on set theory is developed for calculating contaminant transport in real-time utilizing Markov matrices from CFD flow data (or discrete flow field data). The methodology provides a rigorous yet simple strategy for determining the number and size of the Markov states, the time step associated with the Markov matrix, and calculation of individual entries of the Markov matrix. The procedure is benchmarked against scalar transport of validated airflow fields in enclosed and ventilated spaces. The approach can be applied to any general airflow field, and is shown to calculate contaminant transport over 3000 times faster than solving the corresponding scalar transport partial differential equation. This near real-time methodology allows for the development of more robust sensing and control procedures of critical care environments (clean rooms and hospital wards), small enclosed spaces (like airplane cabins) and high traffic public areas (train stations and airports).","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fontanini, Anthony D.; Vaidya, Umesh; Ganapathysubramanian, Baskar","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71cbcd372f40d92f4f92183564cdc9eb11ac458e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125716.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288034/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132315300688; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132315300688; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.07.020","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Markov matrix","Markov states","contaminant transport analysis","real-time utilizing Markov matrices","real-time methodology","scalar transport of validated airflow fields","small enclosed spaces","isolation of spaces","ventilated spaces","corresponding scalar transport partial differential equation","discrete flow field data","CFD flow data","general airflow field","movement of contaminants","ventilation of gaseous contaminants","control procedures of critical care environments","tracking airborne infectious disease","airplane cabins","hospital wards","high traffic public areas","clean rooms","applications","indoor environment","train stations","convenient way","robust sensing","calculation of individual entries","number","development","time step","simple strategy","airports","size","times","set theory","biological attacks","Abstract","standardized method","approach"],"language":"en"},

There is no effective treatment for ARDS/ALI. The renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) through Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-generated Angiotensin II contributes to lung injury. ACE2, a recently discovered ACE homologue, acts as a negative regulator of the RAS and counterbalances the function of ACE. We hypothesized that ACE2 prevents Bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury. Fourteen to 16-week-old ACE2 knockout mice\u2014male (ACE2(\u2212/y)) and female (ACE2(\u2212/\u2212))\u2014and age-matched wild-type (WT) male mice received intratracheal BLM (1.5U/kg). Male ACE2(\u2212/y) BLM injured mice exhibited poorer exercise capacity, worse lung function and exacerbated lung fibrosis and collagen deposition compared with WT. These changes were associated with increased expression of the profibrotic genes \u03B1-smooth muscle actin (\u03B1-SMA) and Transforming Growth Factor \u00DF1. Compared with ACE2(\u2212/y) exposed to BLM, ACE2(\u2212/\u2212) exhibited better lung function and architecture and decreased collagen deposition. Treatment with intraperitoneal recombinant human (rh) ACE2 (2 mg/kg) for 21 days improved survival, exercise capacity, and lung function and decreased lung inflammation and fibrosis in male BLM-WT mice. Female BLM WT mice had mild fibrosis and displayed a possible compensatory upregulation of the AT2 receptor. We conclude that ACE2 gene deletion worsens BLM-induced lung injury and more so in males than females. Conversely, ACE2 protects against BLM-induced fibrosis. rhACE2 may have therapeutic potential to attenuate respiratory morbidity in ALI/ARDS.","publish_time":"2012-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rey-Parra, G.

The comparison of skew graphs for many virus isolates or families is difficult, time-consuming, and nonquantitative. Here, we present a procedure for a more simple identification of similarities and dissimilarities between nucleotide skew data of coronavirus, flavivirus, picornavirus, and HIV-1 RNA genomes. Window and step sizes were normalized to correct for differences in length of the viral genome. Cumulative skew data are converted into pairwise Euclidean distance matrices, which can be presented as neighbor-joining trees. We present skew value trees for the four virus families and show that closely related viruses are placed in small clusters. Importantly, the skew value trees are similar to the trees constructed by a \u201Cclassical\u201D model of evolutionary nucleotide substitution. Thus, we conclude that the simple calculation of Euclidean distances between nucleotide skew data allows an easy and quantitative comparison of characteristic sequence signatures of virus genomes.

Knowledge of the etiology of a RTI is essential to facilitate the appropriate management and the implementation of the most effective control measures. This perspective explains why laboratory methods that can identify pathogens in respiratory secretions have been developed over the course of many years. High-complexity multiplex panel assays that can simultaneously detect up to 20 viruses and up to four bacteria within a few hours have been marketed. However, are these platforms actually useful in pediatric clinical practice? In this manuscript, we showed that these platforms appear to be particularly important for epidemiological studies and clinical research. On the contrary, their routine use in pediatric clinical practice remains debatable. They can be used only in the hospital as they require specific equipment and laboratory technicians with considerable knowledge, training, and experience. Moreover, despite more sensitive and specific than other tests routinely used for respiratory pathogen identification, they do not offer significantly advantage for detection of the true etiology of a respiratory disease. Furthermore, knowledge of which virus is the cause of a respiratory disease is not useful from a therapeutic point of view unless influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus are the infecting agents as effective drugs are available only for these pathogens. On the other hand, multiplex platforms can be justified in the presence of severe clinical manifestations, and in immunocompromised patients for whom specific treatment option can be available, particularly when they can be used simultaneously with platforms that allow identification of antimicrobial resistance to commonly used drugs. It is highly likely that these platforms, particularly those with high sensitivity and specificity and with low turnaround time, will become essential when new drugs effective and safe against most of the respiratory viruses will be available. Further studies on how to differentiate carriers from patients with true disease, as well as studies on the implications of coinfections and identification of antimicrobial resistance, are warranted.","publish_time":"2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esposito, Susanna; Mencacci, Antonella; Cenci, Elio; Camilloni, Barbara; Silvestri, Ettore; Principi, Nicola","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/396a42500c39667896d3e7b918422af5854d7439.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6593267.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31275863/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2019.00196","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory disease","respiratory viruses","respiratory secretions","respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory pathogen identification","multiplex platforms","used drugs","effective drugs","Respiratory tract infections","pediatric clinical practice","clinical research","true disease","new drugs effective","identification of antimicrobial resistance","influenza virus","specific equipment","considerable knowledge","true etiology","epidemiological studies","pathogens","presence of severe clinical manifestations","specific treatment option","effective control measures","immunocompromised patients","laboratory technicians","high sensitivity","laboratory methods","High-complexity multiplex panel assays","infecting agents","therapeutic point of view","routine use","low turnaround time","specificity","implementation","training","tests","implications of coinfections","RTIs","carriers","cause","appropriate management","experience","course","bacteria","perspective","hospital","detection","hand","year of life","years","hours","manuscript"],"language":"en"},

LTLs are homologous to leguminous lectins. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized an LTL from kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus. We designated this LTL as MjLTL2. MjLTL2 contains a signal peptide, a Lectin_leg domain, a coiled coil, and transmembrane domain. MjLTL2 is distributed in hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, gill, stomach, and intestine; higher expression levels are seen in hemocytes and the hepatopancreas than in other tissues. MjLTL2 was upregulated following challenge of shrimp with Vibrio anguillarum and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). MjLTL2 can agglutinate several bacteria without Ca2\u002B. In addition, MjLTL2 could bind to several Gram-positive and -negative bacteria by binding to their lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. However, MjLTL2 could not enhance the clearance of V. anguillarum in vivo. In the presence of WSSV infection, MjLTL2 knockdown by RNA interference resulted in a 7-day lower cumulative mortality of M. japonicus. Moreover, less VP19, VP24, VP26, and VP28 mRNAs were extracted from the hemocytes of MjLTL2 knockdown shrimp than from the control.

This leads to conditions prone to outbreaks that imperil the health of displaced persons and threaten global health security. Past literature has minimally examined the association of communicable disease outbreaks with complex emergencies (CEs) and natural disasters (NDs). METHODS: To examine this association, we identified CEs and NDs using publicly available datasets from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters and United Nations Flash and Consolidated Appeals archive for 2005\u20132014. We identified outbreaks from World Health Organization archives. We compared findings to identify overlap of outbreaks, including their types (whether or not of a vaccine-preventable disease), and emergency event types (CE, ND, or Both) by country and year using descriptive statistics and measure of association. RESULTS: There were 167 CEs, 912 NDs, 118 events linked to \u2018Both\u2019 types of emergencies, and 384 outbreaks. Of CEs, 43% were associated with an outbreak; 24% NDs were associated with an outbreak; and 36% of \u2018Both\u2019 types of emergencies were associated with an outbreak. Africa was disproportionately affected, where 67% of total CEs, 67% of \u2018Both\u2019 events (CE and ND), and 46% of all outbreaks occurred for the study period. The odds ratio of a vaccine-preventable outbreak occurring in a CE versus an ND was 4.14 (95% confidence limits 1.9, 9.4). CONCLUSIONS: CEs had greater odds of being associated with outbreaks compared with NDs. Moreover, CEs had high odds of a vaccine-preventable disease causing that outbreak. Focusing on better vaccine coverage could reduce CE-associated morbidity and mortality by preventing outbreaks from spreading.","publish_time":"2017-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Culver, Amanda; Rochat, Roger; Cookson, Susan T.","journal":"Confl Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fa7de71e210e3f7884579d7da079c77fa0d5d6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5706345.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29209410/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13031-017-0135-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ND","United Nations Flash and Consolidated Appeals","World Health Organization"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["NDs","overlap of outbreaks","vaccine-preventable outbreak","total CEs","association of communicable disease outbreaks","types of emergencies","vaccine-preventable disease","CE-associated morbidity","natural disasters","health of displaced persons","Epidemiology of Disasters","complex emergencies","measure of association","better vaccine coverage","greater odds","odds ratio","high odds","emergency event types","events","global health security","World Health Organization archives","unprecedented numbers of persons","United Nations Flash","descriptive statistics","Research","available datasets","Consolidated Appeals","year","Center","country","decade","conflict","mortality","CONCLUSIONS","conditions prone","Past literature","study period","findings","confidence limits","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","Africa"],"language":"en"},

The 4.9- and 4.8-kDa proteins appear to be vestiges of an 11-kDa protein for which a single nucleotide deletion event in the central part of the gene gave rise to a stop codon. The consensus CYAAAC sequence precedes the 4.9-, 12.7-, and 9.5-kDa ORFs and predicts that transcription will start from each of these sites. Northern analyses using sequence-specific probes and oligo(dT)-selected RNA demonstrated that the predicted transcripts are made, and that these correspond to mRNAs 4, 5, and 5-1. BCV mRNA 4 appears to be a counterpart to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) mRNA 4 which, in the MHV JHM strain, encodes the putative 15.2-kDa nonstructural protein. BCV mRNAs 5 and 5-1 appear to be used for the synthesis of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins, respectively, which demonstrates a pattern of expression strikingly different from that utilized by MHV. MHV makes its homologs of the 12.7- and 9.5-kDa proteins from the single mRNA 5. In vitro translation analyses demonstrated that the BCV 9.5-kDa protein, unlike its MHV counterpart, is poorly made from downstream initiation of translation. Thus, from a comparison between BCV and MHV we find evolutionary evidence for the importance of the CYAAAC sequence in regulating coronavirus transcription.","publish_time":"1990-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abraham, Sushma; Kienzle, Thomas E.; Lapps, William E.; Brian, David A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229090513Q; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229090513Q","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCV","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["kDa proteins","kDa ORFs","kDa nonstructural protein","MHV counterpart","BCV mRNAs","nucleotide sequence","MHV JHM strain","single mRNA","consensus CYAAAC sequence","genome","membrane protein genes","sequence-specific probes","coronavirus transcription","translation analyses","bovine coronavirus","single nucleotide deletion event","Northern analyses","downstream initiation of translation","oligo","selected RNA","dT","mouse hepatitis virus","spike","sequencing cDNA clones","evolutionary evidence","open reading frames","rise","importance","vestiges","stop codon","predicted transcripts","pattern of expression","comparison","homologs","order","sites","synthesis"],"language":"en"},

Beneficial effects of melatonin have been previously reported in an animal model of acute liver failure (ALF) induced by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV). This study was aimed to investigate whether melatonin protection against liver injury induced by the RHDV associates to modulation of autophagy. Rabbits were infected with 2 \u00D7 10(4) hemagglutination units of a RHDV isolate and received 20 mg/kg melatonin at 0, 12, and 24 hr postinfection. RHDV induced autophagy, with increased expression of beclin\u20101, ubiquitin\u2010like autophagy\u2010related (Atg)5, Atg12, Atg16L1 and sequestrosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1), protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) staining, and conversion of LC3\u2010I to autophagosome\u2010associated LC3\u2010II. These effects reached a maximum at 24 hr postinfection, in parallel to extensive colocalization of LC3 and lysosome\u2010associated membrane protein (LAMP)\u20101. The autophagic response induced by RHDV infection was significantly inhibited by melatonin administration. Melatonin treatment also resulted in decreased immunoreactivity for RHDV viral VP60 antigen and a significantly reduction in RHDV VP60 mRNA levels, oxidized to reduced glutathione ratio (GSSG/GSH), caspase\u20103 activity, and immunoglobulin\u2010heavy\u2010chain\u2010binding protein (BiP) and CCAAT/enhancer\u2010binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) expression. Results indicate that, in addition to its antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects, and the suppression of ER stress, melatonin induces a decrease in autophagy associated with RHDV infection and inhibits RHDV RNA replication.

Summary Among the 60 or so various cannabinoids which are present in cannabis sativa indica, terpenophenols are mainly found, including delta-9-trans tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC) which is the major psychoactive ingredient. Over the last decade, due to the emergence of e-commerce and the continuous investigations by pharmaceutical groups to identify new active molecules, synthetic cannabinoids have been proposed. These compounds, under the generic name \u201Cspices\u201D have chemical structures very different from that of \u03949-THC, but share the same CB1 and CB2 receptors. They are mimics of \u03949-THC with much powerful pharmacological effects, including thus more deterrent side-effects, and enhanced windows of detection. All these drugs are controlled. This means that they have to be tested in human biological specimens to document abuse.

CSF has four major functions: physical support of neural structures, excretion and \u201Csink\u201D action, intracerebral transport, and control of the chemical environment of the central nervous system. CSF provides a \u201Cwater jacket\u201D of physical support and buoyancy. The CSF is protective because its volume changes reciprocally with changes in the volume of intracranial contents, particularly blood. Thus, the CSF protects the brain from changes in arterial and central venous pressure associated with posture, respiration, and exertion. Acute or chronic pathological changes in intracranial contents can be accommodated, to a point, by changes in the CSF volume. The direct transfer of brain metabolites into the CSF provides excretory function. This capacity is important because the brain lacks a lymphatic system. The lymphatic function of the CSF is also manifested in the removal of large proteins and cells, such as bacteria or blood cells, by bulk CSF absorption. The \u201Csink\u201D action of the CSF arises from the restricted access of water-soluble substances to the CSF and the low concentration of these solutes in the CSF.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vernau, William; Vernau, Karen A.; Sue Bailey, Cleta","journal":"Clinical Biochemistry of Domestic Animals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e07670a69eb7b21b1cc305d170051f806752f15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150067.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012370491700026X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012370491700026X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CSF volume","bulk CSF absorption","volume changes","chronic pathological changes","volume of intracranial contents","blood cells","sink","action","lymphatic system","lymphatic function","central nervous system","physical support of neural structures","major functions","direct transfer of brain metabolites","excretory function","central venous pressure","excretion","chemical environment","anatomy","posture","control","bacteria","intracerebral transport","restricted access of water-soluble substances","water jacket","biochemistry of cerebrospinal fluid","respiration","chapter","low concentration","removal of large proteins","Publisher Summary","buoyancy","solutes","exertion","capacity","point"],"language":"en"},

The spread of COVID-19 has been heterogeneous, resulting in some regions having sporadic transmission and relatively few hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and others having community transmission that has led to overwhelming numbers of severe cases. For these regions, healthcare delivery has been disrupted and compromised by critical resource constraints in diagnostic testing, hospital beds, ventilators, and healthcare workers who have fallen ill to the virus exacerbated by shortages of personal protective equipment. While mild cases mimic common upper respiratory viral infections, respiratory dysfunction becomes the principal source of morbidity and mortality as the disease advances. Thoracic imaging with chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) are key tools for pulmonary disease diagnosis and management, but their role in the management of COVID-19 has not been considered within the multivariable context of the severity of respiratory disease, pre-test probability, risk factors for disease progression, and critical resource constraints. To address this deficit, a multidisciplinary panel comprised principally of radiologists and pulmonologists from 10 countries with experience managing COVID-19 patients across a spectrum of healthcare environments evaluated the utility of imaging within three scenarios representing varying risk factors, community conditions, and resource constraints. Fourteen key questions, corresponding to 11 decision points within the three scenarios and three additional clinical situations, were rated by the panel based upon the anticipated value of the information that thoracic imaging would be expected to provide. The results were aggregated, resulting in five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of CXR and CT in the management of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rubin, Geoffrey D.; Ryerson, Christopher J.; Haramati, Linda B.; Sverzellati, Nicola; Kanne, Jeffrey P.; Raoof, Suhail; Schluger, Neil W.; Volpi, Annalisa; Yim, Jae-Joon; Martin, Ian B.K.; Anderson, Deverick J.; Kong, Christina; Altes, Talissa; Bush, Andrew; Desai, Sujal R.; Goldin, Jonathan; Goo, Jin Mo; Humbert, Marc; Inoue, Yoshikazu; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Luo, Fengming; Mazzone, Peter J.; Prokop, Mathias; Remy-Jardin, Martine; Richeldi, Luca; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia M.; Tomiyama, Noriyuki; Wells, Athol U.; Leung, Ann N.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0db2db383fe9a59378790bc7ecb6890604860ef.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369220306735?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32275978/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369220306735; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.04.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of COVID","spread of COVID","severity of respiratory disease","critical resource constraints","disease progression","disease advances","Thoracic imaging","healthcare workers","healthcare delivery","respiratory dysfunction","pulmonary disease diagnosis","scenarios","utility of imaging","mild cases","community transmission","spectrum of healthcare environments","confirmed cases","unprecedented healthcare crisis","regions","varying risk factors","use of CXR","key tools","community conditions","hospitalized patients","key questions","overwhelming numbers of severe cases","additional recommendations","sporadic transmission","multidisciplinary panel","common upper respiratory viral infections","additional clinical situations","pre-test probability","diagnostic testing","hospital beds","ventilators","computed tomography","principal source of morbidity","chest radiography","mortality","medical practitioners","anticipated value","radiologists","pulmonologists","countries","information","experience","shortages of personal protective equipment","role","decision points","multivariable context","virus","deaths","pandemic","deficit","Abstract","months","results"],"language":"en"},

The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionately. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes independently from age, gender and other comorbidities. Methods This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Results 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg/m2. The median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipidemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI\u003C25 kg/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25-34 kg/m2: 17.2%, BMI\u226535 kg/m2: 34.8%, p= 0.03). Increasing age (analyzed in quartiles), male sex, BMI\u226535 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25-34 kg/m2), heart failure, CAD, and CKD or ESRD were found to have a significant univariate association with mortality. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that BMI\u226535 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25-34 kg/m2, OR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.45 - 9.83; p=0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.25 - 5.98; p=0.011) and increasing age (analyzed in quartiles, OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.13 - 2.63; p=0.011) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Similarly, age, male sex, BMI\u226535 kg/m2 and current or prior smoking were significant predictors for increasing oxygenation requirements in the multivariate analysis, while male sex, age and BMI\u226535 kg/m2 were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for the outcome of intubation. Conclusions In this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palaiodimos, Leonidas; Kokkinidis, Damianos G.; Li, Weijia; Karamanis, Dimitrios; Ognibene, Jennifer; Arora, Shitij; Southern, William N.; Mantzoros, Christos S.","journal":"Metabolism: clinical and experimental","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/332095308585d48bec6384ec06cddc4b075d63a8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422233/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026049520301268?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2020.154262; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0026049520301268","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BMI","ESRD"],"locations":["Bronx"],"keyphrases":["m2","median BMI","median age","COVID","hospital mortality","female sex","hospital outcomes","multivariate analysis","early outcomes of patients","significant predictors","worse outcomes","cohort of hospitalized patients","severe obesity","prevalence of obesity","increasing oxygenation requirements","quartiles","reference","common comorbidities","significant univariate association","common symptoms","tertiary medical center","electronic medical records","current epicenter of Coronavirus disease","prior smoking","New York","CAD","minority-predominant population","CKD","heart failure","characteristics","gender","Abstract Background","weeks","ESRD","retrospective study","Conclusions","outcome of intubation","primary endpoint","underrepresented minorities","Methods","Results","Bronx","years","Hypertension","hyperlipidemia","Fever","cough","admission","objectives","pandemic","hospitalization","diabetes","dyspnea"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a TGEV JS2012 strain was isolated from the feces of piglets in Jiangsu Province, China. The phylogenetic analysis showed that TGEV JS2012 was placed between the Purdue and the Miller clusters. Analysis of recombination confirmed that TGEV JS2012 is a natural recombinant strain between Miller M6 and Purdue 115. Similar to Miller M6, virulent Purdue and China strain TS, in S gene the JS2012 maintained genetic integrity and the characteristics of the TGEV virulent strains.

MBL deficiency and susceptibility to different types of infections have been subject to extensive studies over the last decades. In humans and chickens, several studies have shown that MBL participates in the protection of hosts against virus infections. Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease of economic importance in the poultry industry caused by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). MBL has earlier been described to play a potential role in the pathogenesis of IBV infection and the production of IBV-specific antibodies, which may be exploited in optimising IBV vaccine strategies. The present study shows that MBL has the capability to bind to IBV in vitro. Chickens from two inbred lines (L10H and L10L) selected for high or low MBL serum concentrations, respectively, were vaccinated against IBV with or without the addition of the MBL ligands mannan, chitosan and fructooligosaccharide (FOS). The addition of MBL ligands to the IBV vaccine, especially FOS, enhanced the production of IBV-specific IgG antibody production in L10H chickens, but not L10L chickens after the second vaccination. The addition of FOS to the vaccine also increased the number of circulating CD4\u002B cells in L10H chickens compared to L10L chickens. The L10H chickens as well as the L10L chickens also showed an increased number of CD4\u2212CD8\u03B1\u2212\u03B3\u03B4 T-cells when an MBL ligand was added to the vaccine, most pronouncedly after the first vaccination. As MBL ligands co-administered with IBV vaccine induced differences between the two chicken lines, these results indirectly suggest that MBL is involved in the immune response to IBV vaccination. Furthermore, the higher antibody response in L10H chickens receiving vaccine and FOS makes FOS a potential adjuvant candidate in an IBV vaccine.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kj\u00E6rup, Rikke M.; Dalgaard, Tina S.; Norup, Liselotte R.; Bergman, Ingrid-Maria; S\u00F8rensen, Poul; Juul-Madsen, Helle R.","journal":"Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/329b4aa757557f56f89d796a0034cd3fe4bf983c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114666.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24305086/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171298513001964; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2013.10.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171298513001964","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBL","IBV","FOS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["L10H chickens","production of IBV","IBV vaccination","L10L chickens","MBL deficiency","addition of MBL ligands","MBL ligands mannan","optimising IBV vaccine strategies","pathogenesis of IBV infection","MBL ligands co-administered","addition of FOS","low MBL serum concentrations","immune response","specific IgG antibody production","higher antibody response","potential role","increased number of CD4","virus infections","coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","number of circulating CD4","major role","specific antibodies","extensive studies","chicken lines","inbred lines","\u03B3\u03B4 T-cells","different types of infections","potential adjuvant candidate","poultry industry","CD8\u03B1","differences","susceptibility","contagious disease of economic importance","chitosan","fructooligosaccharide","soluble pattern-recognition receptor","Abstract Mannose-binding lectin","protection of hosts","results","capability","present study","decades","humans"],"language":"en"},

Although many endemic zoonoses can be treated, timely diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of human cases is often challenging. Preventive \u2018One Health\u2019 interventions, e.g. interventions in animal populations that generate human health benefits, may provide a useful approach to overcoming some of these challenges. Effective strategies, such as animal vaccination, already exist for the prevention, control and elimination of many endemic zoonoses, including rabies, and several livestock zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever) that are important causes of human febrile illness and livestock productivity losses in low- and middle-income countries. We make the case that, for these diseases, One Health interventions have the potential to be more effective and generate more equitable benefits for human health and livelihoods, particularly in rural areas, than approaches that rely exclusively on treatment of human cases. We hypothesize that applying One Health interventions to tackle these health challenges will help to build trust, community engagement and cross-sectoral collaboration, which will in turn strengthen the capacity of fragile health systems to respond to the threat of emerging zoonoses and other future health challenges. One Health interventions thus have the potential to align the ongoing needs of disadvantaged communities with the concerns of the broader global community, providing a pragmatic and equitable approach to meeting the global goals for sustainable development and supporting the global health security agenda.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: During a one-year period throat swab samples were collected from 370 previously healthy children, aged 14 days to 13 years, admitted to two different paediatric wards because of respiratory tract infection. Samples were tested for HBoV by PCR amplifying a part of the NS1 gene. RESULTS: Human bocavirus was detected in 12 children (3.2%). Four of the 12 cases were co-infections, 3 of them with influenza A and 1 with coronavirus OC43. Cases were observed only during the cold months. The mean age of children was 1.8 years (range 2 months to 4 years). The most common symptoms were fever, cough and various degrees of respiratory distress. All children were clinically diagnosed as having lower respiratory tract infections, mainly pneumonia and acute laryngotracheobronchitis, and recovered uneventfully. CONCLUSIONS: HBoV infections occur in Greece mostly among very young children. They accounted for 3.2% of children hospitalized with acute respiratory disease.

While the basic tenants of immunotoxicity have not changed in the past 10 years, several publications have explored the application of immunotoxicological data to the risk assessment process. Therefore, the goal of this unit is still to highlight relationships between xenobiotic-induced immunosuppression and risk of clinical diseases progression. In immunotoxicology, this may require development of models to equate moderate changes in markers of immune functions to potential changes in incidence or severity of infectious diseases. For most xenobiotics, exposure levels and disease incidence data are rarely available and safe exposure levels must be estimated based on observations from experimental models or human biomarker studies. Thus, it is important to establish a scientifically sound framework that allows accurate and quantitative interpretation of experimental or biomarker data in the risk assessment process.","publish_time":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeWitt, Jamie C.; Germolec, Dori R.; Luebke, Robert W.; Johnson, Victor J.","journal":"Current Protocols in Toxicology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/705b0c701546541fbe8c4d7a0f72c641ce7c3ae7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3522887d91c9a63aa41275ac9a721bfa477416d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4780336.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26828330/; https://doi.org/10.1002/0471140856.tx1801s67; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4780336?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biomarker data","risk assessment process","disease incidence data","experimental models","unit","risk of clinical diseases progression","application of immunotoxicological data","safe exposure levels","moderate changes","potential changes","development of models","quantitative interpretation of experimental","human biomarker studies","severity of infectious diseases","markers of immune functions","xenobiotic-induced immunosuppression","observations","sound framework","publications","relationships","xenobiotics","basic tenants of immunotoxicity","years","overview","update","immunotoxicology","goal"],"language":"en"},

G3BPs appear to facilitate this activity through their role in stress granules for which they are considered a core component, however, it should be noted that not all stress granules contain G3BPs and this appears to be contextual depending on the environmental stress and the cell type. Although the role of G3BPs in stress granules appears to be one of its major roles, data also strongly suggests that they interact with mRNAs outside of stress granules to regulate gene expression. G3BPs have been implicated in several diseases including cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis as well as virus survival. There is now a body of evidence that suggests targeting of G3BPs could be explored as a form of cancer therapeutic. This review discusses the important discoveries and advancements made in the field of G3BPs biology over the last two decades including their roles in RNA stability, translational control of cellular transcripts, stress granule formation, cancer progression and its interactions with viruses during infection. An emerging theme for G3BPs is their ability to regulate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli, disease progression and virus infection making it an intriguing target for disease therapies.","publish_time":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alam, Umber; Kennedy, Derek","journal":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular Cell Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3d43e01644406aedbc802a7fc54f37f228dd5bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114234.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167488918303434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30595162/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2018.09.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488918303434","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stress granules","role of G3BPs","field of G3BPs biology","gene expression","cancer progression","stress granule formation","disease progression","response","environmental stimuli","environmental stresses","virus infection","family of RNA binding proteins","form of cancer therapeutic","mRNA stability","disease therapies","virus survival","major roles","translational control of cellular transcripts","SH3 domain","advancements","intriguing target","metastasis","interactions","decades","invasion","viruses","diseases","Abstract Ras-GTPase","activity","important discoveries","review","emerging theme","Rasputin","cell type","data","mRNAs","body of evidence","core component"],"language":"en"},

Several publicized drugs are being used with not much evidence of their efficacy such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin or lopinavir-ritonavir. Yet, the cardiac safety of these drugs in COVID-19 deserves scrutiny as they are known to foster cardiac adverse ADRs, notably QTc interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram and its arrhythmogenic consequences. Methods: Since March 27th, 2020, the French Pharmacovigilance Network directed all cardiac adverse drug reactions associated with \u201Coff-label\u201D use of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and lopinavir-ritonavir in COVID-19 to the Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance. Each Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance first assessed causality of drugs. We performed a specific analysis of these cardiac adverse drug reactions amidst an array of risk factors, reassessed the electrocardiograms and estimated their incidence in coronavirus-disease-2019. Results: In one month, 120 reports of cardiac adverse drug reactions have been notified, 102 of which associated with hydroxychloroquine alone (85%), or associated with azithromycin (60%). Their estimated incidence is 0.77% to 1.54% of all patients, notwithstanding strong underreporting. Lopinavir-ritonavir came third with 17 reports (14%) and chloroquine fourth with 3 reports (2.5%). There were 8 sudden, unexplained or aborted deaths (7%), 8 ventricular arrhythmias (7 %), 90 reports of prolonged QTc (75%) most of them \u201Cserious\u201D (64%), 48 of which proved \u2265 500 ms, 20 reports of severe conduction disorders (17%) and 5 reports of other cardiac causes (4%). Six reports derived from automedication. Discussion and conclusion: \u201COff-label\u201D use of treatments in COVID-19 increases the risk of cardiac ADRs, some of them avoidable. Even if these drugs are perceived as familiar, they are used in patients with added risk factors caused by infection. Precautions should be taken to mitigate the risk, even if they will be proven efficacious.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"G\u00E9rard, Alexandre; Romani, Serena; Fresse, Audrey; Viard, Delphine; Parassol, Nad\u00E8ge; Granvuillemin, Aur\u00E9lie; Chouchana, Laurent; Rocher, Fanny; Drici, Milou-Daniel","journal":"Therapie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cbd0d0f17cad7dd86798c201b8d36b3e489503e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.05.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040595720300913?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040595720300913; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418730/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Nice Regional Center"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reports of cardiac adverse drug reactions","cardiac adverse ADRs","risk of cardiac ADRs","COVID","cardiac safety","cardiac causes","reports of prolonged QTc","azithromycin","lopinavir-ritonavir","use of hydroxychloroquine","reports of severe conduction disorders","causality of drugs","publicized drugs","array of risk factors","added risk factors","label","Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance","patients","estimated incidence","French Pharmacovigilance Network","use of treatments","QTc interval prolongation","specific analysis","unprecedented challenge","electrocardiograms","month","aborted deaths","physicians","scientists","infection","efficacy","arrhythmogenic consequences","coronavirus-disease","strong underreporting","conclusion","evidence","Summary Introduction","scrutiny","ventricular arrhythmias","Discussion","Results","automedication","Methods","Precautions"],"language":"en"},

Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1\u0027-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir. This study highlights the importance of considering the balance between incorporation and excision properties of NAs between the RdRp and ExoN.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shannon, Ashleigh; Tuyet Le, Nhung Thi; Selisko, Barbara; Eydoux, Cecilia; Alvarez, Karine; Guillemot, Jean-Claude; Decroly, Etienne; Peersen, Olve; Ferron, Francois; Canard, Bruno","journal":"Antiviral Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e8874fb92f6e4e828b2b4e7521396f1b1132a6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151495.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354220302072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283108/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104793; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302072?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV RdRp","viral RNA synthesis","important viral diseases","Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases","identified RdRp resistance mutations","promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors","ExoN proteins","available analogues","available antivirals","competent SARS-CoV","excision properties of NAs","significant incorporation","nucleoside analogues","nucleoside active site","altered excision","active metabolite of Remdesivir","GS","available structures","enzyme active sites","promising NA candidate","residues important","rapid global emergence of SARS","curative treatment","structural conservation","domain capable of excising incorporated NAs","NA drug design","cause of significant health concern","Lassa virus N exonuclease","manner consistent","delayed chain termination","models","essential roles","relation","nucleotide recognition","discrimination","prophylactic","presence","high sequence","challenging case","immediate need","function implications","ribose","balance","addresses","increased antiviral effect","target of choice","importance","enzymes","CN group","study","Coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Exploiting a mutant coxsackievirus resistant to PI4KB inhibition, we show that PI4KB activity has distinct functions both in proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein and in RO biogenesis. The escape mutation rectifies a proteolytic processing defect imposed by PI4KB inhibition, pointing to a possible escape mechanism. Remarkably, under PI4KB inhibition, the mutant virus could replicate its genome in the absence of ROs, using instead the Golgi apparatus. This impaired RO biogenesis provided an opportunity to investigate the proposed role of ROs in shielding enteroviral RNA from cellular sensors. Neither accelerated sensing of viral RNA nor enhanced innate immune responses was observed. Together, our findings challenge the notion that ROs are indispensable for enterovirus genome replication and immune evasion.","publish_time":"2017-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Melia, Charlotte E.; van der Schaar, Hilde M.; Lyoo, Heyrhyoung; Limpens, Ronald W.A.L.; Feng, Qian; Wahedi, Maryam; Overheul, Gijs J.; van Rij, Ronald P.; Snijder, Eric J.; Koster, Abraham J.; B\u00E1rcena, Montserrat; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.","journal":"Cell Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86db8aa209550ebe1e807a42ec268087be6ce826.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ee08ea83f740cad8dd0181e3ce4e788b471f08d1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c95776489d0799c87e8864bca71117d723cdaca1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5656745.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.09.068; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124717313736; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124717313736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29045829/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["RO"],"keyphrases":["PI4KB inhibition","PI4KB activity","enterovirus genome replication","enterovirus replication","replication organelles","absence of ROs","proposed role of ROs","phosphatidylinositol","proteolytic processing defect","impaired RO biogenesis","viral polyprotein","accelerated sensing of viral RNA","cellular endomembranes","cellular sensors","immune evasion","mutant virus","escape mutation","shielding enteroviral RNA","innate immune responses","mutant coxsackievirus resistant","possible escape mechanism","opportunity","distinct functions","kinase type III\u03B2","notion","Enteroviruses","phosphate","product","PI4P","Golgi apparatus","findings"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesise that foreskin tissue samples of asymptomatic HSV-2 seropositive men had remaining signs of inflammation at the molecular level. Even in the absence of clinical lesions, genital inflammation may contribute to increased HIV susceptibility on sexual exposure to the virus. SETTING: Foreskin tissue samples were collected from men undergoing elective circumcision in Kisumu, Kenya. PARTICIPANTS: The foreskin tissue samples (n=86) were stratified into study groups based on HSV-2 serology and assessed for mRNA expression of inflammatory markers. Markers of interest were further assessed by immunohistochemical staining within the tissue samples. RESULTS: The two study groups had comparable levels of all molecular markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD69, CCR5, HLA-DR, Langerin, DC-SIGN, Mannose Receptor 1, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03B1, \u03B27, IgA, IFN-\u03B1, CCL5, E-cadherin, ZO-1 and occludin), except for lower mRNA levels of the epithelial junction protein claudin-1 in the HSV-2 seropositive group (p=0.008). Although mRNA levels of claudin-1 were lower in HSV-2 seropositive individuals, the corresponding protein could be visualised in the foreskin epithelium of all samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas no general inflammation was demonstrated in the foreskin of asymptomatic HSV-2 seropositive individuals, a decreased expression of claudin-1 indicates a less robust genital epithelial barrier. An intact epithelial barrier is essential for blocking mucosal entry of genital infections, including HIV.","publish_time":"2015-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"R\u00F6hl, Maria; Tjernlund, Annelie; Mehta, Supriya D; Pettersson, Pernilla; Bailey, Robert C; Broliden, Kristina","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f45403508d925c6fd337bd53f0842e1340a6fcd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4336463.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25694458/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006627","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mannose Receptor"],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["foreskin tissue samples of asymptomatic HSV","foreskin of asymptomatic HSV","seropositive men","seropositive individuals","genital inflammation","mRNA levels of claudin","foreskin epithelium","lower mRNA levels","seropositive group","mRNA expression of inflammatory markers","molecular markers","epithelial junction protein claudin","robust genital epithelial barrier","comparable levels","signs of inflammation","general inflammation","decreased expression of claudin","intact epithelial barrier","study groups","IFN-\u03B1","TNF-\u03B1","mucosal entry of genital infections","corresponding protein","molecular level","infiltrates of inflammatory cells","increased HIV susceptibility","local sites of herpes simplex virus","Langerin","HLA-DR","CCR5","CD69","DC-SIGN","CCL5","CD8","IgA","CD4","CD3","Skin biopsies","months","E-cadherin","\u03B27","sexual exposure","occludin","Mannose Receptor","elective circumcision","induced ulcers","ZO","OBJECTIVES","Kisumu","macroscopic healing","absence of clinical lesions","serology","Kenya","immunohistochemical staining","SETTING","PARTICIPANTS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Specifically, the research found a decrease in domestic passengers of 28.2%, in flights of 24.6% and in seat capacity of 27.9% after the introduction of HSR services. The impacts are found much stronger among those air routes that connect major hub within a distance range of 500 to 800km. The uneven nature of the impact can be seen in the different experiences of selected cities.

In the present study, the fecal virome of a non-diarrheic Belgian piglet was determined. Although the virome of only a single piglet was analyzed, some interesting data were obtained, including the second complete genome of a pig group C rotavirus (RVC). This Belgian strain was only distantly related to the only other completely characterized pig RVC strain, Cowden. Its relatedness to RVC strains from other host species was also analyzed and the porcine strain found in our study was only distantly related to RVCs detected in humans and cows. The gene encoding the outer capsid protein VP7 belonged to the rare porcine G3 genotype, which might be serologically distinct from most other pig RVC strains. A putative novel RVC VP6 genotype was identified as well. A group A rotavirus strain also present in this fecal sample contained the rare pig genotype combination G11P[27], but was only partially characterized. Typical pig RVA genotypes I5, A8, and T7 were found for the viral proteins VP6, NSP1, and NSP3, respectively. Interestingly, the fecal virome of the piglet also contained an astrovirus and an enterovirus, of which the complete genomes were characterized. Results of the current study indicate that many viruses may be present simultaneously in fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets. In this study, these viruses could not be directly associated with any disease, but still they might have had a potential subclinical impact on pig growth performance. The fast evolution of NGS will be a powerful tool for future diagnostics in veterinary practice. Its application will certainly lead to better insights into the relevance of many (sub)clinical enteric viral infections, that may have remained unnoticed using traditional diagnostic techniques. This will stimulate the development of new and durable prophylactic measures to improve pig health and production.","publish_time":"2016-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Theuns, Sebastiaan; Concei\u00E7\u00E3o-Neto, N\u00E1dia; Zeller, Mark; Heylen, Elisabeth; Roukaerts, Inge D.M.; Desmarets, Lowiese M.B.; Van Ranst, Marc; Nauwynck, Hans J.; Matthijnssens, Jelle","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26e9624c98a68d7eb804598374f1a0e6e92b35cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172746.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134816301903; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134816301903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27184192/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2016.05.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS","RVC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pig RVC strains","pig health","fecal virome","porcine strain","present study","pig growth performance","pig group C rotavirus","porcine enteric virome","rotavirus strain","Belgian strain","rare pig genotype combination G11P","current study","putative novel RVC VP6 genotype","rare porcine G3 genotype","non-diarrheic Belgian piglet","Typical pig RVA genotypes I5","fecal samples of non-diarrheic piglets","single piglet","viruses","viral proteins VP6","clinical enteric viral infections","complete genomes","fast evolution of NGS","durable prophylactic measures","powerful tool","A8","outer capsid protein VP7","future diagnostics","T7","potential subclinical impact","veterinary practice","relevance","development of new","technologies","NSP1","host species","composition","better insights","traditional diagnostic techniques","enterovirus","generation sequencing","NSP3","RVCs","production","relatedness","Cowden","interesting data","humans","cows","application","astrovirus","Results","disease"],"language":"en"},

By employment of virus replicon particles or infectious RNA which can replicate but not form de novo virions, we exclude a transfer of virus from the donor cell to the pDC. pDC activation by infected cells was mediated by a contact-dependent RNA transfer to pDC, which was sensitive to a TLR7 inhibitor. This was inhibited by drugs affecting the cytoskeleton and membrane cholesterol. We further demonstrate that a unique viral protein with ribonuclease activity, the viral E(rns) protein of pestiviruses, efficiently prevented this process. This required intact ribonuclease function in intracellular compartments. We propose that this pathway of activation could be of particular importance for viruses which tend to be mostly cell-associated, cause persistent infection, and are non-cytopathogenic.","publish_time":"2013-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Python, Sylvie; Gerber, Markus; Suter, Rolf; Ruggli, Nicolas; Summerfield, Artur","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b11ed8edd1f59ac713ddcc3282ad5a98b8b68b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3681750.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23785283/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003412","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transfer of virus","virus particles","pDC activation","employment of virus replicon particles","HIV-infected cells","pathway of activation","process","classical swine fever virus","unique viral protein","Plasmacytoid dendritic cells","ribonuclease activity","viral E","contact-dependent RNA transfer","protein of pestiviruses","infectious RNA","donor cell","intact ribonuclease function","virion-free pathway","alpha induction","member","rns","direct stimulation","terms of interferon","persistent infection","intracellular compartments","particular importance","drugs","cytoskeleton","membrane cholesterol","HCV","Flaviviridae","TLR7 inhibitor","novo virions"],"language":"en"},

However, R(0) cannot reflect the time-varying nature of an epidemic. A time-varying effective reproductive number R(t) can provide more information because it tracks the subsequent evolution of transmission. However, since it neglects individual-level geographical variations in exposure risk, R(t) may smooth out interpersonal heterogeneous transmission potential, obscure high-risk spreaders, and hence hamper the effectiveness of control measures in spatial dimension. Therefore, this study proposes a new method for quantifying spatially adjusted (time-varying) reproductive numbers that reflects spatial heterogeneity in transmission potential among individuals. This new method estimates individual-level effective reproductive numbers (R(j)) and a summarized indicator for population-level time-varying reproductive number (R(t)). Data from the five most severe dengue outbreaks in southern Taiwan from 1998\u20132015 were used to demonstrate the ability of the method to highlight early spreaders contributing to the geographic expansion of dengue transmission. Our results show spatial heterogeneity in the transmission potential of dengue among individuals and identify the spreaders with the highest R(j) during the epidemic period. The results also reveal that super-spreaders are usually early spreaders that locate at the edges of the epidemic foci, which means that these cases could be the drivers of the expansion of the outbreak. Therefore, our proposed method depicts a more detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process and identifies the significant role of the edges of the epidemic foci, which could be weak spots in disease control and prevention.","publish_time":"2019-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Ta-Chou; Wen, Tzai-Hung","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/98f9843f4b024272b6514db6e53546839101a839.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6914775.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-55574-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31844099/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission potential of dengue","effective reproductive number R","highest R","geographic expansion of dengue transmission","early spreaders","epidemic foci","interpersonal heterogeneous transmission potential","spatial heterogeneity","detailed spatial-temporal dengue transmission process","subsequent evolution of transmission","super-spreaders","basic reproductive number","new method","epidemic period","time-varying nature","individual-level effective reproductive numbers","population-level time","spatial dimension","proposed method","obscure high-risk spreaders","severe dengue outbreaks","edges","individuals","results","individual-level geographical variations","disease control","effectiveness of control measures","exposure risk","weak spots","summarized indicator","significant role","prevention","southern Taiwan","public health practice","drivers","information","fundamental measure","cases","Data","study","ability"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Data of reported COVID-19 cases and Baidu Migration Index of 21 cities in Guangdong province and other provinces of China as of February 25, 2020 were collected. The imported risk index of each city in Guangdong province were calculated, and then correlation analysis was performed between reported cases and the imported risk index to identify lag time. Finally, we classified the early warming levels of epidemic by imported risk index. Results: A total of 1 347 confirmed cases were reported in Guangdong province, and 90.0% of the cases were clustered in the Pearl River Delta region. The average daily imported risk index of Guangdong was 44.03. Among the imported risk sources of each city, the highest risk of almost all cities came from Hubei province, except for Zhanjiang from Hainan province. In addition, the neighboring provinces of Guangdong province also had a greater impact. The correlation between the imported risk index with a lag of 4 days and the daily reported cases was the strongest (correlation coefficient: 0.73). The early warning base on cumulative 4-day risk of each city showed that Dongguan, Shenzhen, Zhongshan, Guangzhou, Foshan and Huizhou have high imported risks in the next 4 days, with imported risk indexes of 38.85, 21.59, 11.67, 11.25, 6.19 and 5.92, and the highest risk still comes from Hubei province. Conclusions: Cities with a large number of migrants in Guangdong province have a higher risk of import. Hubei province and neighboring provinces in Guangdong province are the main source of the imported risk. Each city must strengthen the health management of migrants in high-risk provinces and reduce the imported risk of Guangdong province.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, J X; Liu, T; Xiao, J P; He, G H; Rong, Z H; Yin, L H; Wan, D H; Zeng, W L; Gong, D X; Guo, L C; Zhu, Z H; Zeng, L L; Kang, M; Song, T; Zhong, H J; He, J F; Sun, L M; Li, Y; Ma, W J","journal":"Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213268/; https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200226-00190","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guangdong","China","Pearl River Delta","Hainan","Guangzhou"],"keyphrases":["imported risk of Guangdong province","imported risk of COVID","imported risk sources","imported risk indexes","highest risk","Hubei province","day risk","average daily imported risk index of Guangdong","neighboring provinces of Guangdong province","Hainan province","higher risk of import","high imported risks","cities","city","daily reported cases","confirmed cases","Baidu Migration Index","high-risk provinces","provinces of China","Data of reported COVID","days","correlation coefficient","correlation analysis","early warning base","lag time","early warming levels of epidemic","large number of migrants","health management of migrants","Foshan","Guangzhou","Huizhou","Zhongshan","main source","Shenzhen","Dongguan","Zhanjiang","Pearl River Delta region","Conclusions","total","Methods","addition","greater impact","Results","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Anxiety was assessed using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) questionnaire, stress was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, and sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS: Low levels of social capital were associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress, but increased levels of social capital were positively associated with increased quality of sleep. Anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality, and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive effects of social capital on sleep quality. CONCLUSION: During a period of individual self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic in central China, increased social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Han; Zhang, Yan; Kong, Desheng; Li, Shiyue; Yang, Ningxi","journal":"Med Sci Monit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14591bae9b4cf2cfdbd409c0dec9106a13298297.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111105.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32194290/; https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.923921","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Self-Rating Anxiety Scale","Stanford Acute Stress Reaction"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Individual social capital","social capital improved sleep quality","increased levels of social capital","Low levels of social capital","increased quality of sleep","positive effects of social capital","Personal Social Capital Scale","reduced sleep quality","increased levels of anxiety","measure of social trust","central China","Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index","Self-Rating Anxiety Scale","combination of anxiety","COVID","period of individual self-isolation","self-reported questionnaires","Stanford Acute Stress Reaction","days","home","virus epidemic","Path analysis","day of isolation","Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis","structural equation modeling","SASR","mechanisms","people","PSQI","PSCI","independent variables","SEM","relationships","RESULTS","coronavirus disease","METHODS","Individuals","CONCLUSION","participation","BACKGROUND","study"],"language":"en"},

Using the ResPlexII v2.0 (Qiagen) multiplex PCR, 393 positive results were obtained in 468 clinical samples collected during an influenza season in Germany. The overall distribution of positive results was influenza A 42.0%, influenza B 38.7%, adenovirus 1.5%, bocavirus 0.5%, coronavirus 3.3%, enterovirus 5.6%, metapneumovirus 1.0%, parainfluenza virus 0.8%, rhinovirus 4.1%, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 2.5%. Double infections of influenza virus together with another virus were found for adenovirus B and E, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus and for rhinovirus. These other viruses were rapidly lost upon passages in MDCK 33016PF cells and under conditions as applied to influenza virus passaging. Clinical samples, in which no influenza virus but other viruses were found, were also subject to passages in MDCK 33016PF cells. Using lower inoculum dilutions than those normally applied for preparations containing influenza virus (total dilution of the original sample of \u223C104), the positive results for the different viruses turned negative already after 2 or 3 passages in MDCK 33016PF cells. These results demonstrate that, under practical conditions as applied to grow influenza viruses, contaminating viruses can be effectively removed by passages in MDCK cells. In combination with their superior isolation efficiency, MDCK cells appear highly suitable to be used as an alternative to embryonated eggs to isolate and propagate influenza vaccine candidate viruses.","publish_time":"2012-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roth, Bernhard; Mohr, Hannah; Enders, Martin; Garten, Wolfgang; Gregersen, Jens-Peter","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4f9da845a7cd9ffab610124c8609d01e598ce9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130813.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X11018597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22119922/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.11.063; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X11018597","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDCK","ResPlexII v2."],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["influenza viruses","influenza virus passaging","MDCK cells","influenza B","virus-positive samples","influenza season","PF cells","Double infections of influenza virus","respiratory viruses","influenza vaccine candidate viruses","parainfluenza virus","passages","different viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","overall distribution of positive results","multiplex PCR screening of human clinical samples","adenovirus B","coronavirus","bocavirus","enterovirus","rhinovirus","practical conditions","total dilution","superior isolation efficiency","corresponding data","Qiagen","preparations","original sample","embryonated eggs","alternative","combination","metapneumovirus","RSV","paper","ResPlexII v2","lower inoculum dilutions","Germany"],"language":"en"},

By studying the spatiotemporal associations of febrile patients, it may allow early detection of case clustering that indicates imminent threat of infectious disease outbreaks in the community. METHODS: We captured consecutive emergency department visits that led to hospitalization in a district hospital in Hong Kong during the period of 12 Sep 2005 to 14 Oct 2005. We recorded demographic data, provisional diagnoses, temperature on presentation and residential location for each patient-episode, and geocoded the residential addresses. We applied Geographical Information System technology to study the geographical distribution these cases, and their associations within a 50-m buffer zone spatially. A case cluster was defined by three or more spatially associated febrile patients within each three consecutive days. RESULTS: One thousand and sixty six patient-episodes were eligible for analysis; 42% of them had fever (\u003E37\u00B0C; oral temperature) on presentation. Two hundred and four patient-episodes (19.1%) came from residential care homes for elderly (RCHE). We detected a total of 40 case clusters during the study period. Clustered cases were of older age; 57 (33.3%) were residents of RCHE. We found a median of 3 patients (range: 3 - 8) and time span of 3 days (range: 2 - 8 days) in each cluster. Twenty five clusters had 2 or more patients living in the same building block; 18 of them were from RCHE. CONCLUSIONS: It is technically feasible to perform surveillance on febrile patients and studying their spatiotemporal associations. The information is potentially useful for early detection of impending infectious disease threats.","publish_time":"2010-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Kin-wing; Wong, Ngai-sze; Lee, Lap-yip; Lee, Shui-shan","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f94dde3cf8c2776d869b8490fb491d7416088f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2831836.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-84; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20170529/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Geographical Information System","RCHE"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["spatiotemporal associations of febrile patients","case clusters","consecutive days","patient-episodes","early detection of case clustering","presentation","residential location","residential addresses","range","Fever","study period","residents of RCHE","early detection of impending infectious disease threats","residential care homes","oral temperature","geographical distribution","Geographical Information System technology","Clustered cases","imminent threat of infectious disease outbreaks","consecutive emergency department visits","sensitivity of syndromic surveillance systems","hospitalization","provisional diagnoses","district hospital","Hong Kong","undifferentiated clinical feature","demographic data","elderly","older age","BACKGROUND","METHODS","community","analysis","time span","building block","total","median","buffer zone","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In 2010, this feline infectious peritonitis\u2013like disease was first identified in a laboratory ferret in Japan, and laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis was limited to IHC. This report describes 2 cases of systemic coronavirus-associated disease in ferrets presented to Japanese veterinary hospitals. Both presented with pyogranulomatous inflammation in the abdominal cavity, and both cases tested positive for coronavirus antigen by IHC. In 1 case, for which unfixed tissues were available, FRSCV RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the affected tissues.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shigemoto, Jin; Muraoka, Yukinori; Wise, Annabel G.; Kiupel, Matti; Maes, Roger K.; Torisu, Shidow","journal":"Journal of Exotic Pet Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/701b4a2eb732847ff97ecb301a1f91309f99d529.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106053.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jepm.2014.02.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1557506314000408; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1557506314000408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288680/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IHC"],"locations":["Europe","United States"],"keyphrases":["cases of systemic coronavirus-associated disease","IHC","systemic disease of domestic ferrets","ferret systemic coronavirus","laboratory ferret","FRSCV RNA","laboratory confirmation","coronavirus antigen","definitive laboratory diagnosis","pyogranulomatous inflammation","feline infectious peritonitis","reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests","affected tissues","clinical diagnosis","abdominal cavity","Europe","Japanese veterinary hospitals","granulomatous lesions","combination of immunohistochemistry","report","United States"],"language":"en"},

Careful compliance with established hygiene practices by healthcare workers together with effective antiseptic options is essential for the protection of patients from infectious agents. For over 60 years, povidone iodine (PVP-I) formulations have been shown to limit the impact and spread of infectious diseases with potent antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal effects. In addition to a lack of reported resistance, the benefits of PVP-I include an excellent safety profile and a broad spectrum of effect due to its multimodal action. Studies have shown that hand washing with PVP-I-based antiseptics is effective for the decontamination of skin, while PVP-I mouthwashes and gargles significantly reduce viral load in the oral cavity and the oropharynx. The importance of PVP-I has been emphasised by its inclusion in the World Health Organization\u2019s list of essential medicines, and high potency for virucidal activity has been observed against viruses of significant global concern, including hepatitis A and influenza, as well as the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome and Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses. Together with its diverse applications in antimicrobial control, broad accessibility across the globe, and outstanding safety and tolerability profile, PVP-I offers an affordable, potent, and widely available antiseptic option.

Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) reduces rotavirus infection and diarrhea. However, the molecular mechanisms of LGG-mediated protection from rotavirus infection are poorly understood. Autophagy plays an essential role in responses to microbial pathogens. However, the role of autophagy in HRV infection and LGG treatment is unknown. We hypothesize that rotavirus gastroenteritis activates autophagy and that LGG suppresses virus-induced autophagy and prevents intestinal damage in infected piglets. METHODS: We used LGG feeding to combat viral gastroenteritis in the gnotobiotic pig model of virulent HRV infection. RESULTS: We found that LGG feeding did not increase autophagy, whereas virus infection induced autophagy in the piglet intestine. Virus infection increased the protein levels of the autophagy markers ATG16L1 and Beclin-1 and the autophagy regulator mTOR. LGG treatment during viral gastroenteritis reduced autophagy marker expression to normal levels, induced apoptosis and partially prevented virus-induced tissue damage. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insights into virus-induced autophagy and LGG suppression of uncontrolled autophagy and intestinal injury. A better understanding of the antiviral activity of LGG will lead to novel therapeutic strategies for infant infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2013-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Shaoping; Yuan, Lijuan; Zhang, Yongguo; Liu, Fangning; Li, Guohua; Wen, Ke; Kocher, Jacob; Yang, Xingdong; Sun, Jun","journal":"Gut Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aab412e1a2fee75cf3e3fbc911d985ac004f866e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3750464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23924832/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1757-4749-5-22","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LGG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus-induced autophagy","role of autophagy","LGG suppression of uncontrolled autophagy","LGG treatment","LGG feeding","rotavirus infection","autophagy marker expression","autophagy markers ATG16L1","autophagy regulator mTOR","antiviral activity of LGG","molecular mechanisms of LGG","rotavirus gastroenteritis","induced apoptosis","prevented virus-induced tissue damage","viral gastroenteritis","Human rotavirus","gnotobiotic pig model of virulent HRV infection","intestinal damage","normal levels","protein levels","intestinal injury","essential role","important cause of severe diarrhea","novel therapeutic strategies","infants","mediated protection","new insights","infant infectious diseases","responses","Beclin","Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG","microbial pathogens","young children","study","better understanding","infected piglets","piglet intestine","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

In vitro, the replication of FECV in peripheral blood monocytes always drops after 12h post inoculation, while FIPV sustains its replication in the monocytes from 45% of the cats. The accessory proteins of feline coronaviruses have been speculated to play a prominent role in virulence as deletions were found to be associated with attenuated viruses. Still, no functions have been ascribed to them. In order to investigate if the accessory proteins of FIPV are important for sustaining its replication in monocytes, replication kinetics were determined for FIPV 79-1146 and its deletion mutants, lacking either accessory protein open reading frame 3abc (FIPV-\u03943), 7ab (FIPV-\u03947) or both (FIPV-\u03943\u03947). Results showed that the deletion mutants FIPV-\u03947 and FIPV-\u03943\u03947 could not maintain their replication, which was in sharp contrast to wt-FIPV. FIPV-\u03943 could still sustain its replication, but the percentage of infected monocytes was always lower compared to wt-FIPV. In conclusion, this study showed that ORF7 is crucial for FIPV replication in monocytes/macrophages, giving an explanation for its importance in vivo, its role in the development of FIP and its conservation in field strains. The effect of an ORF3 deletion was less pronounced, indicating only a supportive role of ORF3 encoded proteins during the infection of the in vivo target cell by FIPVs.","publish_time":"2013-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dedeurwaerder, Annelike; Desmarets, Lowiese M.; Olyslaegers, Dominique A.J.; Vermeulen, Ben L.; Dewerchin, Hannah L.; Nauwynck, Hans J.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2888a26c5c92f322daff992270f33f2a35e44a5e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117191.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113512005846; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113512005846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23182908/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.10.032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FECV","FIPV","FIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIPV replication","wt-FIPV","FIPV-\u03943\u03947","accessory proteins of FIPV","deletion mutants FIPV-\u03947","replication of FECV","replication kinetics","peripheral blood monocytes","percentage of infected monocytes","accessory proteins of feline coronaviruses","ORF3 deletion","macrophages","supportive role of ORF3","prominent role","important difference","low virulent feline enteric coronavirus","accessory protein open reading frame","lethal feline infectious peritonitis virus","abc","ORF7","h post inoculation","conservation","development of FIP","infection","sharp contrast","target cell","field strains","study","virulence","deletions","explanation","Results","FIPVs","conclusion","importance","effect","order","ability","attenuated viruses","cats","functions"],"language":"en"},

Objective We sought to investigate the risk factors for recurrent wheezing and to determine post hoc the efficacy of prednisolone in risk groups. Methods We followed for 1 year 118 children (median age, 1.1 years) who had had their first episode of wheezing and had participated in a trial comparing prednisolone with placebo in hospitalized children. Demographics and laboratory data were obtained at study entry. The follow-up outcome was recurrent wheezing (3 physician-confirmed episodes). Results Recurrent wheezing was diagnosed in 44 (37%) children. Independent risk factors were age \u003C 1 year, atopy, and maternal asthma. The probability of recurrent wheezing was higher in rhinovirus than respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\u2013affected children among placebo recipients (hazard ratio, 5.05; 95% CI, 1.00-25.41). Prednisolone decreased the probability of recurrent wheezing in children with eczema (0.15; 95% CI, 0.04-0.63) but not in those without eczema (1.89; 95% CI, 0.83-4.29; P = .007 for interaction). Prednisolone was associated with less recurrent wheezing in the rhinovirus group (0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.71), but not in the RSV (2.12; 95% CI, 0.46-9.76) or in the RSV/rhinovirus-negative groups (2.03; 95% CI, 0.83-5.00; P = .017 for interaction). Conclusion Rhinovirus-induced early wheezing is a major viral risk factor for recurrent wheezing. Prednisolone may prevent recurrent wheezing in rhinovirus-affected first-time wheezers. The presence of eczema may also influence the response to prednisolone.

The internal proteins of batFLUAV are functional in mammalian cells. In contrast, no biological functionality could be demonstrated for the surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA)-like (HAL) and neuraminidase (NA)-like (NAL), and these proteins need to be replaced by their human counterparts to allow spread of batFLUAV in human cells. Here, we employed rhabdoviral vectors to study the role of HAL and NAL in viral entry. Vectors pseudotyped with batFLUAV-HAL and -NAL were able to enter bat cells but not cells from other mammalian species. Host cell entry was mediated by HAL and was dependent on prior proteolytic activation of HAL and endosomal low pH. In contrast, sialic acids were dispensable for HAL-driven entry. Finally, the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 was able to activate HAL for cell entry indicating that batFLUAV can utilize human proteases for HAL activation. Collectively, these results identify viral and cellular factors governing host cell entry driven by batFLUAV surface proteins. They suggest that the absence of a functional receptor precludes entry of batFLUAV into human cells while other prerequisites for entry, HAL activation and protonation, are met in target cells of human origin.","publish_time":"2016-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoffmann, Markus; Kr\u00FCger, Nadine; Zmora, Pawel; Wrensch, Florian; Herrler, Georg; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68493ffac48a4fdbc15314a0a2bf5cabd087f853.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4814062.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27028521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["batFLUAV-HAL","entry of batFLUAV","HAL activation","HAL-driven entry","human cells","role of HAL","viral entry","batFLUAV surface proteins","Host cell entry","spread of batFLUAV","internal proteins of batFLUAV","bat cells","mammalian cells","prior proteolytic activation of HAL","target cells of human origin","human proteases","human counterparts","contrast","related viruses","termed bat-associated influenza","functional receptor","rhabdoviral vectors","mammalian species","cellular factors","transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2","prerequisites","endosomal low pH","protonation","sialic acids","type","results","hemagglutinin","absence","biological functionality","New World bats","neuraminidase"],"language":"en"},

Signaling through this receptor is thought to influence the immune activity of microglia as well as monocytes egress from the bone marrow (BM) and their trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS) in several neurological diseases. During experimental herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis (HSE), CCR2 deficiency has been reported to exacerbate the outcome of the disease. However, the precise contribution of CCR2 expressed in cells of the CNS or peripheral monocytes in the protection against HSE remains unclear. To dissect the differential role of CCR2 during HSE, chimeric mice with receptor deficiency in the brain or blood cells were generated by transplanting wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 or CCR2(-/-) BM-derived cells in CCR2(-/-) (WT\u2192CCR2(-/-)) and WT (CCR2(-/-)\u2192WT) mice, respectively. Our results indicate that following intranasal infection with 1.2x10(6) plaque forming units of HSV-1, CCR2 deficiency in hematopoietic cells and, to a lesser extent, in CNS exacerbates the outcome of HSE. Mortality rates of CCR2(-/-) (71.4%) and CCR2(-/-)\u2192WT (57.1%) mice were significantly higher than that of WT (15.3%; P\u003C0.01 and P\u003C0.05, respectively) but the difference did not reach statistical significance for WT\u2192CCR2(-/-) animals (42.8%; P = 0.16). Both peripheral and CNS deficiencies in CCR2 resulted in increased infectious viral titers and wider dissemination of HSV antigens in the brain as well as an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5. Furthermore, CCR2 deficiency in the hematopoietic system altered monocytes egress from the BM and their recruitment to the CNS, which may contribute to the failure in HSV-1 containment. Collectively, these data suggest that CCR2 expressed on cells of CNS and especially on peripheral monocytes is important for the control of HSV-1 replication and inflammatory environment during experimental HSE.","publish_time":"2016-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menasria, Rafik; Canivet, Coraline; Piret, Jocelyne; Gosselin, Jean; Boivin, Guy","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e319e1968d1de70b511e1b51fa5a69b3c75e41d4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5145225.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27930721/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0168034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","HSE","HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCR2 deficiency","WT","differential role of CCR2","precise contribution of CCR2","Mortality rates of CCR2","cells of CNS","peripheral monocytes","inflammatory monocytes","monocytes egress","blood cells","hematopoietic cells","experimental HSE","CNS deficiencies","receptor deficiency","outcome of HSE","control of HSV","units of HSV","BM-derived cells","wider dissemination of HSV antigens","hematopoietic system","brain","inflammatory environment","chimeric mice","chemokine receptor","overproduction of inflammatory cytokines","central nervous system","surface of blood leukocytes","immune activity of microglia","experimental herpes simplex virus","increased infectious viral titers","replication","chemokines","trafficking","protection","bone marrow","2x10","CCL2","wild-type","Ly6C","statistical significance","C57BL","lesser extent","encephalitis","intranasal infection","CCL3","plaque","recruitment","neurological diseases","results","CCL5","difference","failure","containment","animals","data"],"language":"en"},

Emergency department (ED) staff are particularly vulnerable when managing patients with acute respiratory distress due to the aerosolization of the virus during endotracheal intubation. A simple and innovative intubation tent was designed with the intent of decreasing the risk of accidental viral transmission from emergent intubations during the COVID-19 pandemic. PRESENTATION OF TECHNIQUE: The materials and assembly process of the novel \u201CCorona Curtain\u201D are described in technical detail, with the intent of allowing other providers to template the concept at their respective facilities. RESULTS: A total of 36 intubation tents were mounted in the ED at the Medical Center of Aurora, Colorado, on April 7, 2020, and thereafter consistently used for all intubations during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The cost of raw materials and labor for the initial assembly averaged US $ 8.00 per construct. The price of the single-use plastic cover is variable depending on the vendor source. CONCLUSION: The new \u201CCorona Curtain\u201D was designed to improve the safety of ED staff when performing urgent/emergent intubations during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Testing for a broad panel of respiratory viruses has been advocated as a useful tool for antibiotic stewardship. We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the impact of rapid viral test results on antimicrobial prescriptions and clinical outcomes among hospitalized adults. METHODS: Eight hundred patients admitted with respiratory symptoms were tested by a 12-virus respiratory panel (RVP) during 3 consecutive winters in Montreal, Canada. The primary outcome measure was change in antimicrobial prescriptions (ie, de-escalation of empirical antimicrobial therapy or commencement of new antimicrobial therapy) after RVP results were available. Clinical outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS: Influenza virus was identified in 53% of individuals in the study population, and other viruses were identified in 10%. Influenza virus positivity was associated with shorter duration of hospitalization and appropriate antiviral management. Antibiotic management was most significantly correlated with radiographic suspicion of pneumonia and less so with results of the RVP. Positivity for viruses other than influenza virus was not correlated with significantly different outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians respond to results of testing for influenza virus when managing hospitalized adult patients but respond less to test results for other viruses. These data can inform the design of stewardship interventions and the selection of viral testing panels for hospitalized patients.","publish_time":"2017-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Semret, Makeda; Schiller, Ian; Jardin, Barbara Ann; Frenette, Charles; Loo, Vivian G; Papenburg, Jesse; McNeil, Shelly A; Dendukuri, Nandini","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48df5d97aaca671d3c92656500cd75ce9e06d817.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5853820.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jix288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29149338/; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/216/8/936/24264087/jix288.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RVP"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["results of testing","RVP results","virus respiratory panel","Influenza virus positivity","antimicrobial prescriptions","hospitalized patients","initiation of empirical antimicrobial therapy","de-escalation of empirical antimicrobial therapy","broad panel of respiratory viruses","commencement of new antimicrobial therapy","respiratory symptoms","clinical outcomes","impact of rapid viral test results","hospitalized adult patients","hospitalized adults","Respiratory tract infections","antibiotic stewardship","Antibiotic management","different outcomes","selection of viral testing panels","study population","frequent causes of hospitalization","shorter duration of hospitalization","design of stewardship interventions","appropriate antiviral management","prospective observational study","consecutive winters","BACKGROUND","primary outcome measure","useful tool","Montreal","Canada","Physicians","radiographic suspicion of pneumonia","individuals","data","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Method: Ecological study based on population and death data for the months of March 2016 to 2020 in Castilla y Le\u00F3n. The general and provincial standardized rates, the relative risks of the year 2020 with respect to previous years and the risks adjusted by sex, periods and province, using Poisson regression, were calculated. Trend analysis was performed using joinpoint linear regression. Results: An increase in mortality was observed in March 2020 with respect to previous years, with an increase of 39% for men (relative risk [RR]: 1.39; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.32-1.47) and 28% for women (RR: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.21-1.35). The model predicts excess mortality of 775 deaths. In the trend analysis there is a significant turning point in 2019 in men, globally and for almost all provinces. The increase in mortality is general, although heterogeneous by sex, age group and province. Conclusions: Although the observed increase in mortality cannot be totally attributed to the disease, it is the best estimate we have of the real impact on deaths directly or indirectly related to it.

To elucidate the effect of type I IFN on the Jak/stat pathway in salmonid alphavirus subtype 3 (SAV3) infected macrophage/dendritic like TO-cells derived from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) headkidney leukocytes, we used a differential transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGGs) pathway analysis to generate a repertoire of de novo assembled genes from type I IFN treated and non-treated TO-cells infected with SAV3. RESULTS: Concurrent SAV3 infection with type I IFN treatment of TO-cells suppressed SAV3 structural protein (SP) expression by 2log(10) at 2 days post infection compared to SAV3 infection without IFN treatment which paved way to evaluating the impact of type I IFN on expression of Jak/stat pathway genes in SAV3 infected TO-cells. In the absence of type I IFN treatment, SAV3 downregulated several Jak/stat pathway genes that included type I and II receptor genes, Jak2, tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), Stat3 and Stat5 pointing to possible failure to activate the Jak/stat signaling pathway and inhibition of signal transducers caused by SAV3 infection. Although the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) genes 1 and 3 were upregulated in the IFN treated cells, only SOCS3 was downregulated in the SAV3 infected cells which points to inhibition of SOCS3 by SAV3 infection in TO-cells. CONCLUSION: Data presented in this study shows that SAV3 infection downregulates several genes of the Jak/stat pathway, which could be an immune evasion strategy, used to block the transcription of antiviral genes that would interfere with SAV3 replication in TO-cells. Overall, we have shown that combining de novo assembly with pathway based transcriptome analyses provides a contextual approach to understanding the molecular networks of genes that form the Jak/stat pathway in TO-cells infected by SAV3.","publish_time":"2016-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Cheng; Evensen, \u00D8ystein; Munang\u2019andu, Hetron Mweemba","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63cfe8fa64e33300471ac1e2a5b87cb52be553d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4878077.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27215196/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-016-2739-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","IFN"],"locations":["Atlantic"],"keyphrases":["SAV3 infected cells","stat pathway genes","SAV3 replication","Concurrent SAV3 infection","receptor genes","pathway analysis","IFN treatment","SAV3 structural protein","expression of Jak","novo assembled genes","transcription of antiviral genes","Kyoto encyclopedia of genes","molecular networks of genes","impact of type","absence of type","effect of type","infected macrophage","days post infection","inhibition of SOCS3","differential transcriptome analysis","transcriptome analyses","tyrosine kinase","Janus kinase","novo assembly","inhibition of signal transducers","transducer activator of transcription","RNA-seq","salmonid alphavirus subtype","genomes","SP","Salmo salar","contextual approach","dendritic like","headkidney leukocytes","Stat3","Tyk2","Atlantic salmon","Jak2","KEGGs","repertoire","possible failure","Stat5","study","RESULTS","log","cellular development","homeostasis","BACKGROUND","immune evasion strategy","suppressor of cytokine","CONCLUSION","Data"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, cellular miRNAs target and hybridize to specific sequences of both HTLV-1 and HIV-1 viral transcripts. However, much like the variety of host immune responses to retroviral infection, the virus itself contains mechanisms that assist in the evasion of viral inhibition through control of the cellular RNAi pathway. Retroviruses can hijack both the enzymatic and catalytic components of the RNAi pathway, in some cases to produce novel viral miRNAs that can either assist in active viral infection or promote a latent state. Here, we show that HTLV-1 Tax contributes to the dysregulation of the RNAi pathway by altering the expression of key components of this pathway. A survey of uninfected and HTLV-1 infected cells revealed that Drosha protein is present at lower levels in all HTLV-1 infected cell lines and in infected primary cells, while other components such as DGCR8 were not dramatically altered. We show colocalization of Tax and Drosha in the nucleus in vitro as well as coimmunoprecipitation in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, indicating that Tax interacts with Drosha and may target it to specific areas of the cell, namely, the proteasome. In the presence of Tax we observed a prevention of primary miRNA cleavage by Drosha. Finally, the changes in cellular miRNA expression in HTLV-1 infected cells can be mimicked by the add back of Drosha or the addition of antagomiRs against the cellular miRNAs which are downregulated by the virus.","publish_time":"2012-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Duyne, Rachel; Guendel, Irene; Klase, Zachary; Narayanan, Aarthi; Coley, William; Jaworski, Elizabeth; Roman, Jessica; Popratiloff, Anastas; Mahieux, Renaud; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Kashanchi, Fatah","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/778543806bc7ebe5596c085cf9a0421d0c0a1a2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3393700.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22808228/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0040662","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HTLV","cellular RNAi pathway","infected cells","cellular RNAi machinery","cellular miRNAs target","infected primary cells","cellular miRNA expression","Drosha protein","presence of Tax","infected cell lines","novel viral miRNAs","viral transcripts","colocalization of Tax","active viral infection","human cell","present day retroviruses","endogenous retroviruses","expression of key components","specific sequences","evasion of viral inhibition","catalytic components","presence of proteasome inhibitors","retroviral infection","prevention of primary miRNA cleavage","RNA sequences","specific areas","variety of host immune responses","microRNAs","control","lower levels","defense response","major means","cases","coimmunoprecipitation","addition of antagomiRs","changes","latent state","innate ability","mechanisms","survey of uninfected","HIV","nucleus","dysregulation","DGCR8"],"language":"en"},

We studied enteropathogen co-infection in diarrhoeic UK cats using results of a real time PCR assay for 8 enteropathogenic species; feline coronavirus (Co), feline panleukopenia virus (Pa), Clostridium perfringens (Cl), Salmonella enterica (Sa), Giardia spp. (Gi), Tritrichomonas foetus (Tr), Cryptosporidium spp. (Cr), and Toxoplasma gondii (To). Age, gender, breed and history were recorded. PCR panels from 1088 diarrhoeic cats were available for analysis. RESULTS: Overall enteropathogen prevalence was 56.9% (Co), 22.1% (Pa), 56.6% (Cl), 0.8% (Sa), 20.6% (Gi), 18.8% (Tr), 24.4% (Cr) and 1.0% (To). Prevalence of Co, Gi and Tr was higher in pedigree cats compared to non-pedigree cats (DSH) and prevalence decreased with increasing age for Co, Pa, Gi, Cr and Tr. Co-infection was common: \u22652 enteropathogens were detected in 62.5% of cats, and 13.3% of cats had \u22654 enteropathogens. Mean ( [Formula: see text]) enteropathogen co-infection 2.01 (\u00B11.3 SD), was significantly higher in pedigree cats ( [Formula: see text] =2.51) compared to DSH ( [Formula: see text] =1.68) and decreased with age ( [Formula: see text] =2.64 \u003C6 months, [Formula: see text] =1.68 for \u003E1 yr). More cats were negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested (12.7%) than expected. When exact combinations of co-infection were examined, Tr tended to be found in combinations with Co, Cl, and Gi. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple infections should be considered the most likely result of faecal testing in cats, and case management needs to take this into account. In contrast, the relatively high percentage of cats negative for all 8 enteropathogens tested could indicate an innate resistance to infection. Alternatively it could indicate a lack of exposure to these 8 enteropathogens or the presence of other enteropathogens not assessed by this assay.","publish_time":"2014-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paris, Jasmin K; Wills, Sheila; Balzer, Hans-J\u00F6rg; Shaw, Darren J; Gunn-Moore, Dani\u00E8lle A","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09db5b9c6d7c4f5d804c532939fb4f824c409bb6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3896830.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410914/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella","Cr"],"organizations":["UK","DSH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diarrhoeic cats","ill cats","non-pedigree cats","text","Formula","diarrhoeic UK cats","high percentage of cats","patterns of enteropathogen co-infection","exact combinations of co-infection","Overall enteropathogen prevalence","Individual enteropathogen infections","results","DSH","increasing age","feline coronavirus","real time PCR assay","PCR panels","Multiple infections","feline panleukopenia virus","enteropathogenic species","Clostridium perfringens","Giardia","case management needs","Salmonella enterica","Tritrichomonas foetus","BACKGROUND","Cryptosporidium","faecal testing","gender","breed","history","analysis","SD","months","contrast","account","CONCLUSIONS","Toxoplasma gondii","innate resistance","limited basis","lack of exposure","yr","presence"],"language":"en"},

This study evaluated the incidence, predictors and prognosis of AKI associated with scrub typhus according to the RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage kidney disease) criteria. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of patients diagnosed with scrub typhus from January 2001 to November 2013 in Gyeongsang National University Hospital. RESULTS: During the study period, 510 patients were diagnosed with scrub typhus and the incidence of AKI was 35.9%. There were 132 (25.9%) patients at risk, 37 (7.3%) with injury and 14 (2.7%) with failure. In comparison with the non-AKI group, the AKI group was older (73.9 vs 63.4 years, p\u003C0.001) and had more comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI frequently occurs in hypertensive patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers or ACE inhibitors (p=0.002), and in patients with diabetes with higher glycated haemoglobin levels (p=0.033). Haematuria and proteinuria were more frequent in the AKI group. There was no relationship between the severity of proteinuria and occurrence of AKI. Intensive care unit admission and death were more frequent in the AKI group. The renal function of most patients with AKI recovered without sequelae, except for 1 patient who had underlying CKD. Multivariate analysis showed that age, presence of CKD, serum albumin level and time to hospital presentation after symptom onset were independent predictors of AKI in patients with scrub typhus. CONCLUSIONS: Our current results suggest that the presence of underlying CKD, older age, lower serum albumin level and time to hospital presentation after symptom onset were important risk factors to determine occurrence of AKI. Whether earlier diagnosis and treatment in patients with the above risk factors reduce the incidence and severity of AKI deserves to be investigated.","publish_time":"2017-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Kyungo; Jang, Ha Nee; Lee, Tae Won; Cho, Hyun Seop; Bae, Eunjin; Chang, Se-Ho; Park, Dong Jun","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f50bc0f52caca340de8ba25900681253da739f2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5353335.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28298367/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013882","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AKI","Gyeongsang National University Hospital","CKD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incidence of AKI","severity of AKI","occurrence of AKI","prognosis of AKI","non-AKI group","independent predictors of AKI","hypertensive patients","scrub typhus ranges","medical records of patients","presence of CKD","presence of underlying CKD","hospital presentation","acute kidney injury","important risk factors","time","symptom onset","older age","chronic kidney disease","death","severity of proteinuria","failure","lower serum albumin level","end-stage kidney disease","diabetes mellitus","Gyeongsang National University Hospital","Renal involvement","renal function","current results","study period","simple urinary abnormalities","loss","angiotensin receptor blockers","higher glycated haemoglobin levels","ACE inhibitors","hypertension","vs","RIFLE","Intensive care unit admission","criteria","treatment","OBJECTIVES","comorbidities","Multivariate analysis","years","earlier diagnosis","comparison","sequelae","CONCLUSIONS","relationship","Haematuria","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Psychological training of healthcare workers prior to an influenza pandemic may reduce stress-related absenteeism, however, established training methods that change behavior and attitudes are too resource-intensive for widespread use. This study tests the feasibility and effectiveness of a less expensive alternative - an interactive, computer-assisted training course designed to build resilience to the stresses of working during a pandemic. METHODS: A \u0022dose-finding\u0022 study compared pre-post changes in three different durations of training. We measured variables that are likely to mediate stress-responses in a pandemic before and after training: confidence in support and training, pandemic-related self-efficacy, coping style and interpersonal problems. RESULTS: 158 hospital workers took the course and were randomly assigned to the short (7 sessions, median cumulative duration 111 minutes), medium (12 sessions, 158 minutes) or long (17 sessions, 223 minutes) version. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, the course was associated with significant improvements in confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy and interpersonal problems. Participants who under-utilized coping via problem-solving or seeking support or over-utilized escape-avoidance experienced improved coping. Comparison of doses showed improved interpersonal problems in the medium and long course but not in the short course. There was a trend towards higher drop-out rates with longer duration of training. CONCLUSIONS: Computer-assisted resilience training in healthcare workers appears to be of significant benefit and merits further study under pandemic conditions. Comparing three \u0022doses\u0022 of the course suggested that the medium course was optimal.","publish_time":"2010-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maunder, Robert G; Lancee, William J; Mae, Reet; Vincent, Leslie; Peladeau, Nathalie; Beduz, Mary Agnes; Hunter, Jonathan J; Leszcz, Molyn","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8d882efc1f6cf141ce6b4283acd7f87b1b280313.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2851711.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-10-72; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20307302/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["training course","resilience training","medium course","short course","long course","Psychological training of healthcare workers","longer duration of training","established training methods","different durations of training","influenza pandemic","pandemic conditions","pandemic self-efficacy","support","pandemic-related self-efficacy","significant stress","hospital workers","study","sessions","minutes","improved interpersonal problems","improved coping","stress-related absenteeism","significant benefit","significant improvements","confidence","computer","stress-responses","Comparison of doses","median cumulative duration","over-utilized escape-avoidance","rates","extraordinary infectious disease outbreak","pre-post changes","attitudes","behavior","merits","style","resource-intensive","higher drop","expensive alternative","effectiveness","widespread use","trend","feasibility","patient contact","CONCLUSIONS","Participants","variables","analysis","RESULTS","version","stresses","intention","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Abstract The mechanisms for acquiring nosocomial infections are identical in newborn to those described in the adult population. Nosocomial infections are particularly common in premature infants who combine many risk factors : immature immune system, low level of antibodies against several pathogens, parenteral nutrition through central catheter, exposure to close and frequent contacts with multiple stakeholders. Clinical signs of infections are non-specific. Diagnosis lies on increase blood inflammatory parameters and, mainly, blood cultures. Coagulase negative Staphylococci are the predominant pathogen. The rapid evolution of some of these infections and the risk of secondary locations lead to the prescription of a broad-spectrum first-line antibiotic treatment that should be re-evaluated and adjusted secondarily. Inflammatory response induced by nosocomial infections increases the risk of neurological sequellae in premature newborn.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doit, Catherine; Biran, Val\u00E9rie; Aujard, Yannick","journal":"Infections n\u0026#x000e9;onatales","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b8d06f7731cf3cc67c26ea590acdb49c9f4249e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152006.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9782294741357000097; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9782294741357000097","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["infections associ\u00E9es","these infections","infections focales","infections urinaires","nosocomial infections increases the risk","acquiring nosocomial infections","\u00E9volution des infections bact\u00E9riennes","acquisition des infections nosocomiales","incidence des IN","identical in newborn to those described in the adult population","Abstract The mechanisms","the predominant pathogen","The rapid evolution","CVC","septic\u00E9mies associ\u00E9es","pneumopathies associ\u00E9es","pays","neurological sequellae in premature newborn","secondary locations lead to the prescription","\u00E9tat clinique associ\u00E9es","particularly common in premature infants who","syndrome inflammatoire","facteurs de risque","risque de localisations secondaires","ventilation artificielle","exposure to close","many risk factors","risque de s\u00E9quelles neurologiques","increase blood inflammatory parameters","contamination exog\u00E8ne","population adulte","faible concentration","contamination massive","blood cultures","Celle des virus","principales localisations","Inflammatory response induced","staphylocoques coagulase n\u00E9gative","Coagulase negative Staphylococci","fr\u00E9quence des ent\u00E9robact\u00E9ries r\u00E9sistantes","parenteral nutrition through central catheter","antibodies against several pathogens","broad-spectrum first-line antibiotic treatment that should be re","low level","evaluated","some","frequent contacts with multiple stakeholders","dur\u00E9e prolong\u00E9e","personnel","jours","organisme","anticorps","environnement","absence","immaturit\u00E9 du syst\u00E8me immunitaire","mainly","cath\u00E9ters veineux centraux","large spectre","provenance","SCoN","Diagnosis lies","c\u00E9phalosporines","adjusted secondarily","agent pathog\u00E8ne","antibioth\u00E9rapie de premi\u00E8re intention","champignons","pr\u00E9matur\u00E9s","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie","p\u00E9riode","modifications","n\u00E9onatologie","m\u00E9canismes","bact\u00E9ri\u00E9mies","services","Candida","m\u00E9ningites","agents pathog\u00E8nes","voie de d\u00E9veloppement","infection secondaire syst\u00E9mique","\u00E9pid\u00E9miologie bact\u00E9rienne","nouveau","unit\u00E9s","particulier","colonisation","PEVD","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","rapidit\u00E9","causes de bact\u00E9ri\u00E9mie","Clinical signs","urgences","France","specific","mortalit\u00E9 globale","h\u00E9mocultures","diagnostic"],"language":"fr"},

Effects that arise long after the primary infection can also increase the propensity for chronic conditions or lead to the development of cancer. Recent advances in the fields of virology and pathology have been fundamental in improving our understanding of viral pathogenesis, in providing improved vaccination strategies and in developing newer, more effective treatments for patients worldwide. The reviews assembled here focus on the interface between virology and pathology and encompass aspects of both the clinical pathology of viral disease and the underlying disease mechanisms. Articles on emerging diseases caused by Ebola virus, Marburg virus, coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, Nipah virus and noroviruses are followed by reviews of enteroviruses, HIV infection, measles, mumps, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). The issue concludes with a series of articles reviewing the relationship between viruses and cancer, including the role played by Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) in the pathogenesis of lymphoma and carcinoma; how human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are involved in the development of skin cancer; the involvement of hepatitis B virus infection in hepatocellular carcinoma; and the mechanisms by which Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus (KSHV) leads to Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma. We hope that this collection of articles will be of interest to a wide range of scientists and clinicians at a time when there is a renaissance in the appreciation of the power of pathology as virologists dissect the processes of disease.

These strategies include actions both in the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic stages. As a part of pandemic preparedness, public health officials should identify and query healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction that currently care for critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation to determine existing inventory of these devices and facilities\u0027 ability to absorb additional ventilators. Facilities must have sufficient staff, space, equipment, and supplies to utilize allocated ventilators adequately. At the time of an event, jurisdictions will need to verify and update information on facilities\u0027 capacity prior to making allocation decisions. Allocation of scarce life-saving resources during a pandemic should consider ethical principles to inform state and local plans for allocation of ventilators. In addition to ethical principles, decisions should be informed by assessment of need, determination of facilities\u0027 ability to use additional ventilators, and facilities\u0027 capacity to ensure access to ventilators for vulnerable populations (eg, rural, inner city, and uninsured and underinsured individuals) or high-risk populations that may be more susceptible to illness.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koonin, Lisa M.; Pillai, Satish; Kahn, Emily B.; Moulia, Danielle; Patel, Anita","journal":"Health Secur","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/610e0e37a35c6431f2657b0d56e705064a17ce7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194315.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196387/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["allocation of ventilators","stockpiled ventilators","allocated ventilators","use of additional ventilators","facilities\u0027 capacity","pre-pandemic","pandemic preparedness","severe pandemic","determination of facilities\u0027 ability","allocation decisions","intra-pandemic stages","assessment of need","query healthcare facilities","state","insufficient capacity","ethical principles","mechanical ventilation","Allocation of scarce life","strategies","public health officials","public health emergency","local planners","local plans","high-risk populations","vulnerable populations","respiratory illness","accounting","existing inventory","underinsured individuals","critical factors","inner city","resources","devices","access","equipment","sufficient staff","space","ill patients","people","article","update information","ventilator support","larger conceptual framework","jurisdictions","outbreak","actions","time","event","extent"],"language":"en"},

In this study, the cleavage mechanism of the SARS coronavirus main proteinase (Mpro or 3CLpro) on the octapeptide NH2-AVLQ\u2193SGFR-COOH was investigated using molecular mechanics and quantum mechanics simulations based on the experimental structure of the proteinase. It has been observed that the catalytic dyad (His-41/Cys-145) site between domains I and II attracts the \u03C0 electron density from the peptide bond Gln\u2013Ser, increasing the positive charge on C(CO) of Gln and the negative charge on N(NH) of Ser, so as to weaken the Gln\u2013Ser peptide bond. The catalytic functional group is the imidazole group of His-41 and the S in Cys-145. N\u03B41 on the imidazole ring plays the acid\u2013base catalytic role. Based on the \u201Cdistorted key theory\u201D [K.C. Chou, Anal. Biochem. 233 (1996) 1\u201314], the possibility to convert the octapeptide to a competent inhibitor has been studied. It has been found that the chemical bond between Gln and Ser will become much stronger and no longer cleavable by the SARS enzyme after either changing the carbonyl group CO of Gln to CH2 or CF2 or changing the NH of Ser to CH2 or CF2. The octapeptide thus modified might become an effective inhibitor or a potential drug candidate against SARS.","publish_time":"2005-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Du, Qishi; Wang, Shuqing; Wei, Dongqing; Sirois, Suzanne; Chou, Kuo-Chen","journal":"Analytical Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e041872ac728eeeab2932c8ccfd2782c92da5ec2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094278.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003269704008061; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003269704008061","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Chou","Ser"],"organizations":["SARS","NH of Ser"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NH of Ser","peptide bond Gln","Ser peptide bond","SARS enzyme","SARS coronavirus main proteinase","imidazole group","catalytic functional group","carbonyl group","CH2","chemical bond","CF2","catalytic dyad","Cys","octapeptide NH2-AVLQ","base catalytic role","molecular mechanics","imidazole ring","effective inhibitor","respiratory disease","negative charge","positive charge","competent inhibitor","quantum mechanics simulations","Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome","cleavage mechanism","SGFR-COOH","acid","CLpro","potential drug candidate","\u03C0 electron density","Mpro","experimental structure","Chou","distorted key theory","domains","study","site","N\u03B41","possibility","Biochem"],"language":"en"},

Summary Acute pneumonias occur in a variety of clinical settings and accurate identification of bacterial causes is extremely important. No microbiological tool is either 100 % sensitive or 100 % specific, and despite investigations, aetiology remains unanswered in more than 30 % of pneumonia. No sample may be necessary for patients treated as outpatients, non invasive respiratory specimens are preferred in hospitalised individuals (community or healthcare associated), while invasive specimens are used as second line for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in intensive care, and in the first line where pneumonia occurs in immunosuppressed patients. Bacterial cultures have an important place, if the sample is taken before the introduction of antibiotic therapy. Some contexts may justify the use of blood cultures, testing for urinary antigens or serology. PCR is already becoming available as a daily service but the short-term future probably belongs to molecular multiplex panels capable of detecting many microorganisms within hours, especially in severe CAP resuscitation and in pneumonia in the immunosuppressed. High-throughput sequencing nucleotide techniques will soon revolutionize microbiological diagnosis in respiratory medicine, as in other areas of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dahyot, S.; Lemee, L.; Pestel-Caron, M.","journal":"Revue des Maladies Respiratoires","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82ff70175d1f2bb82f89a8d0990db8acf5ff698d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134997.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842517300323; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842517300323","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["in pneumonia in the immunosuppressed","in the first","pneumopathies aigu\u00EBs communautaires","in intensive care","as in other areas","pneumopathies aigu\u00EBs hospitalis\u00E9es","where pneumonia occurs in immunosuppressed patients","pneumopathies communautaires s\u00E9v\u00E8res","preferred in hospitalised individuals","especially in severe CAP resuscitation","Summary Acute pneumonias occur in","if the sample is taken before the introduction","aetiology remains unanswered in more than","community acquired pneumonia","patients treated as outpatients","daily service but the short","Some contexts may justify the","PCR is already becoming available as","throughput sequencing nucleotide techniques will soon revolutionize microbiological diagnosis in respiratory medicine","invasive respiratory specimens","used as second line","bacterial causes is extremely important","Bacterial cultures","No microbiological tool is either","patients trait\u00E9s","r\u00E9animation","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements invasifs","diagnostic microbiologique","culture microbiologique","outil microbiologique","community or healthcare associated","while invasive specimens","an important place","No sample may be necessary","panels mol\u00E9culaires multiplex capables","blood cultures","place importante","urinary antigens or serology","premi\u00E8re ligne","despite investigations","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements respiratoires","contextes cliniques vari\u00E9s","term future probably belongs to molecular multiplex panels capable","detecting many microorganisms within hours","variety","accurate identification","clinical settings","testing","court terme","antibiotic therapy","recherche","High","quotidien","heures","infectious diseases","nombreux micro-organismes","\u00E9tiologies bact\u00E9riennes impliqu\u00E9es","s\u00E9quen\u00E7age nucl\u00E9otidique haut d\u00E9bit","malade","h\u00E9mocultures","avenir","specific","soins","antig\u00E8nes urinaires","instauration","s\u00E9rologies","recours","pneumologie","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","domaines","antibioth\u00E9rapie","\u00E9tiologie identifi\u00E9e","infectiologie"],"language":"fr"},

Twelve Holstein bull calves (approximately 3 wk of age) were allocated by initial body weight to Control (n = 5) and treated (n = 7) groups. On d 0, all calves were orally challenged with 1 \u00D7 107 plaque forming units of virulent coronavirus isolate. Infection was allowed to progress for 24h before treatment was started. On d 1, treated calves began receiving 160g of dry bovine serum powder (16g IgG) mixed into milk replacer powder (67g) at both an a.m. and p.m. feeding. Control calves received only milk replacer powder (227g) at both feedings. Response to coronavirus challenge and dietary treatment was monitored prior to a.m. and p.m. feeding by the collection of multiple clinical measures. Fecal consistency was decreased by coronavirus challenge but was not affected by dietary treatment. Mean daily rectal temperature and heart rate were not affected by dietary treatment. Average packed cell volume was higher in treated calves than in control (35.0 and 27.0%). Coronavirus challenge resulted in an immediate increase in respiration rate, decreasing by d 7. Control calves tended to have a greater average respiration rate compared with treated (28.7 vs. 26.8 breaths/min). Treated calves had a higher average feed intake than control (0.57 vs. 0.44 kg/d).

With the further development of the epidemic, the proportion of clusters has increased. METHODS: In our study, we collected information on COVID-19 clusters in Qingdao City. The epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations were analyzed. RESULTS: Eleven clusters of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao City between January 29, and February 23, 2020, involving 44 confirmed cases, which accounted for 73.33% of all confirmed cases. From January 19 to February 2, 2020, the cases mainly concentrated in the district that had many designated hospitals. Patients aged 20-59 y old accounted for the largest proportion (68.18%) of cases; the male-to-female sex ratio was 0.52:1. Three cases were infected from exposure to confirmed cases. The average incubation period was 6.28 d. The median number of cases per cluster was 4, and the median duration time was 6 d. The median cumulative number of exposed persons was 53. CONCLUSION: More attention should be paid to the epidemic of clusters in prevention and control of COVID-19. In addition to isolating patients, it is essential to track, screen, and isolate those who have come in close contact with patients. Self-isolation is the key especially for healthy people in the epidemic area.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jia, Jing; Hu, Xiaowen; Yang, Feng; Song, Xin; Dong, Liyan; Zhang, Jingfei; Jiang, Fachun; Gao, Ruqin","journal":"Disaster medicine and public health preparedness","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0973d85bcb356a8881de8928e93546875b91f27e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156571.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.59; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32228732/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Qingdao City"],"keyphrases":["confirmed cases","clusters of COVID","median number of cases","epidemic of clusters","proportion of clusters","control of COVID","epidemic area","isolating patients","Qingdao City","median duration time","median cumulative number of exposed persons","largest proportion","healthy people","key","emerging infectious disease","y old","prevention","epidemiological characteristics","clinical manifestations","female sex ratio","OBJECTIVES","average incubation period","study","district","information","Self-isolation","designated hospitals","close contact","attention","addition","countries","development","RESULTS","exposure","CONCLUSION","regions","screen","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

A key strategy in the program is to test for presence of antibodies and protect test-negative herds from infection. Because these viruses are endemic, the rate of re-introduction can be high, and a disease-free status will become more uncertain as time from testing elapses. The aim of this study was to estimate the probability of freedom (PostPFree) from BRSV and BCV antibodies over time by use of bulk tank milk (BTM) antibody-testing, geographic information and animal movement data, and to validate the herd-level estimates against subsequent BTM testing. BTM samples were collected from 1148 study herds in West Norway in 2013 and 2016, and these were analyzed for BRSV and BCV antibodies. PostPFree was calculated for herds that were negative in 2013/2014, and updated periodically with new probabilities every three months. Input variables were test sensitivity, the probability of introduction through animal purchase and local transmission. Probability of introduction through animal purchase was calculated by using real animal movement data and herd prevalence in the region of the source herd. The PostPFree from the final three months in 2015 was compared to BTM test results from March 2016 using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. The probability of freedom was generally high for test-negative herds immediately after testing, reflecting the high sensitivity of the tests. It did however, decrease with time since testing, and was greatly affected by purchase of livestock. When comparing the median PostPFree for the final three months to the test results in 2016, it was significantly lower (p \u003C 0.01) for test positive herds. Furthermore, there was a large difference in the proportion of test positive herds between the first and fourth quartile of PostPFree. The results show that PostPFree provides a better estimate of herd-level BTM status for both BRSV and BCV than what can be achieved by relying solely on the previous test-result.","publish_time":"2018-07-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toftaker, Ingrid; \u00C5gren, Estelle; Stokstad, Maria; N\u00F8dtvedt, Ane; Fr\u00F6ssling, Jenny","journal":"Prev Vet Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a81eea07a9ea0dfffb6ee266358ed09b287df94c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114343.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30064709/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587718303738; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.07.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587718303738","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV","BCV","BTM","Wilcoxon Rank"],"locations":["Norway","West Norway"],"keyphrases":["test-negative herds","BTM test results","proportion of test positive herds","BRSV","study herds","subsequent BTM testing","previous test-result","animal purchase","probability of introduction","BCV antibodies","median PostPFree","quartile of PostPFree","level BTM status","antibody-testing","BTM samples","time","probability of freedom","testing elapses","months","herd prevalence","source herd","high sensitivity","herd-level estimates","better estimate of herd","real animal movement data","presence of antibodies","purchase of livestock","rate of re-introduction","bovine coronavirus","disease-free status","West Norway","national control program","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","use of bulk tank milk","geographic information","region","Wilcoxon Rank Sum","local transmission","large difference","infection","Input variables","viruses","key strategy","new probabilities","tests","aim"],"language":"en"},

We used bioinformatics tools to analyze the codon usage patterns in a genome-wide manner among 11 genomes of NiV as no work was reported yet. The compositional properties revealed that the overall GC and AT contents were 41.96 and 58.04%, respectively i.e. Nipah virus genes were AT-rich. Correlation analysis between overall nucleotide composition and its 3rd codon position suggested that both mutation pressure and natural selection might influence the CUB across Nipah genomes.

Children are at greater risk and suffer most frequently from OM, which can cause serious deterioration in the quality of life. OM is generally classified into two main types: acute and chronic OM (AOM and COM). AOM is characterized by tympanic membrane swelling or otorrhea and is accompanied by signs or symptoms of ear infection. In COM, there is a tympanic membrane perforation and purulent discharge. The most common pathogens that cause AOM are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are commonly associated with COM. Innate and adaptive immune responses provide protection against OM. However, pathogens employ a wide arsenal of weapons to evade potent immune responses and these mechanisms likely contribute to AOM and COM. Immunologic evasion is multifactorial, and involves damage to host mucociliary tract, genetic polymorphisms within otopathogens, the number and variety of different otopathogens in the nasopharynx as well as the interaction between the host\u0027s innate and adaptive immune responses. Otopathogens utilize host mucin production, phase variation, biofilm production, glycans, as well as neutrophil and eosinophilic extracellular traps to induce OM. The objective of this review article is to discuss our current understanding about the mechanisms through which otopathogens escape host immunity to induce OM. A better knowledge about the molecular mechanisms leading to subversion of host immune responses will provide novel clues to develop effective treatment modalities for OM.","publish_time":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parrish, James M.; Soni, Manasi; Mittal, Rahul","journal":"J Leukoc Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/645680322382d4f5ec69710628fae33b580d50aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166519.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.4ru0119-003r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075181/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moraxella"],"organizations":["OM","AOM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AOM","Otopathogens","adaptive immune responses","subversion of host immune responses","potent immune responses","chronic OM","host mucin production","molecular mechanisms","escape host immunity","common pathogens","tympanic membrane perforation","common ear diseases","biofilm production","host\u0027s innate","symptoms of ear infection","phase variation","Moraxella catarrhalis","novel clues","Haemophilus influenzae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","damage","glycans","wide arsenal of weapons","genetic polymorphisms","Staphylococcus aureus","better knowledge","main types","number","objective","neutrophil","mucociliary tract","effective treatment modalities","signs","serious deterioration","interaction","purulent discharge","protection","eosinophilic extracellular traps","review article","current understanding","Immunologic evasion","variety of different","nasopharynx","quality of life","humans","otorrhea","greater risk","Children","Otitis media"],"language":"en"},

Morbilliviruses are enveloped viruses with two envelope proteins, one of which is hemagglutinin (H) protein, which plays a role in binding to cellular receptors. During morbillivirus infection, the virus initially targets lymphoid cells and replicates efficiently in the lymph nodes. The principal cellular receptor for morbillivirus is signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM, also called CD150), which is exclusively expressed on immune cells. This feature reflects the strong lymphoid cell tropism and viral spread in the infected body. Morbillivirus infection, however, affects various tissues in the body, including the lung, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, vascular endothelium, and brain. Thus, other receptors for morbilliviruses in addition to SLAM might exist. Recently, nectin-4 has been identified as a novel epithelial cell receptor for MeV. The expression of nectin-4 is localized to polarized epithelial cells, and this localization supports the notion of cell tropism since MeV also grows well in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract. Although two major receptors for lymphoid and epithelial cells in natural infection have been identified, morbillivirus can still infect many other types of cells with low infectivity, suggesting the existence of inefficient but ubiquitously expressed receptors. We have identified other molecules that are implicated in morbillivirus infection of SLAM-negative cells by alternative mechanisms. These findings indicate that morbillivirus utilizes multiple pathways for establishment of infection. These studies will advance our understanding of morbillivirus tropism and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sato, Hiroki; Yoneda, Misako; Honda, Tomoyuki; Kai, Chieko","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c28ae565308bfabbd784a23fa065a59a49d8cfc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3290766.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22403577/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epithelial cells","lymphoid cells","morbillivirus infection of SLAM","negative cells","types of cells","immune cells","understanding of morbillivirus tropism","MeV","natural infection","establishment of infection","cellular receptors","Morbilliviruses","strong lymphoid cell tropism","rinderpest virus","measles virus","novel epithelial cell receptor","major receptors","notion of cell tropism","canine distemper virus","principal cellular receptor","gastrointestinal tract","respiratory tract","infected body","expression of nectin","viral spread","kidney","lymphocyte activation molecule","respective hosts","vascular endothelium","multiple pathways","replicates","localization","low infectivity","envelope proteins","enveloped viruses","lung","role","alternative mechanisms","feature","important pathogens","existence of inefficient","various tissues","hemagglutinin","severe syndromes","brain","findings","binding","pathogenesis","addition","lymph nodes","CD150","studies","molecules"],"language":"en"},

The high mortality rate associated with this disease has been a major cause of concern. This paper aims at identifying the major factors influencing MERS recovery in KSA. METHODS: The data used for analysis was collected from the Ministry of Health website, KSA. The important factors impelling the recovery are found using machine learning. Machine learning models such as support vector machine, conditional inference tree, na\u00EFve Bayes and J48 are modelled to identify the important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is also carried out to identify the significant factors statistically. RESULT: The main factors influencing MERS recovery rate are identified as age, pre-existing diseases, severity of disease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not. In spite of MERS being a zoonotic disease, contact with camels is not a major factor influencing recovery. CONCLUSION: The methods used were able to determine the prime factors influencing MERS recovery. It can be comprehended that awareness about symptoms and seeking medical intervention at the onset of development of symptoms will make a long way in reducing the mortality rate.","publish_time":"2019-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"John, Maya; Shaiba, Hadil","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc5352a50f90e04d8c5ed64243f863417133e4dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102802.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30979679/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.03.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034119301297; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034119301297","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Middle Eastern"],"keyphrases":["major factors","MERS recovery rate","important factors","main factors","prime factors","significant factors","spite of MERS","major infectious disease","KSA","severity of disease","zoonotic disease","vector machine","Machine learning models","symptoms","high mortality rate","major cause of concern","METHODS","Middle Eastern countries","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","multivariate logistic regression analysis","conditional inference tree","age","na\u00EFve Bayes","medical intervention","J48","onset of development","pre-existing diseases","long way","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","BACKGROUND","patient","camels","Ministry of Health website","awareness","RESULT","healthcare worker","CONCLUSION","data","paper"],"language":"en"},

The New York Institute for All Hazard Preparedness (NYIAHP) of the State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, in cooperation with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene\u0027s Healthcare Emergency Preparedness Program, (NYC DOHMH-HEPP) quarantine working group, has developed a series of clinical protocols to help health care facilities respond to such an event. PROBLEM: Two full-scale exercises (FSEs) were designed and conducted a year apart in the quarantine unit at Kings County Hospital Center (KCHC) to test the efficacy and feasibility of these quarantine protocols. The goal of these exercises was to identify the gaps in preparedness for quarantine and increase hospital readiness for such an event. METHODS: Evaluators monitored for efficient management of critical physical plants, personnel and material resources. Players were expected to integrate and practice emergency response plans and protocols specific to quarantine. In developing the exercise objectives, five activities were selected for evaluation: Activation of the Unit, Staffing, Charting/Admission, Symptom Monitoring and Infection Control, and Client Management. RESULTS: The results of the initial FSE found that there were incomplete critical tasks within all five protocols: These deficiencies were detailed in an After Action Report and an Improvement Plan was presented to the KCHC Disaster Preparedness Committee a month after the initial FSE. In the second FSE a year later, all critical tasks for Activation of the unit, Staffing and Charting/Admission were achieved. Completion of critical tasks related to Symptom Monitoring and Infection Control and Client Management was improved in the second FSE, but some tasks were still not performed appropriately. CONCLUSION: In short, these exercises identified critical needs in disaster preparedness of the KCHC Quarantine Unit. The lessons learned from this logistical exercise enabled the planning group to have a better understanding of leadership needs, communication capabilities, and infection control procedures. Kings County Hospital Center performed well during these exercises. It was clear that performance in the second exercise was improved, and many problems noted in the first exercise were corrected. Staff also felt better prepared the second time. This supports the idea that frequent exercises are vital to maintain disaster readiness. R Nathawad, PM Roblin, D Pruitt, B Arquilla.

For direct visualization of HBV, we determined whether envelope assembly could accommodate the green fluorescent protein (GFP). While the C-terminal addition of GFP to S trans-dominant negatively inhibited empty envelope particle secretion, the N-terminal GFP fusion to S (GFP.S) was co-integrated into the envelope, giving rise to fluorescent particles. Microscopy and topogenesis analyses demonstrated that the proper intracellular distribution and folding of GFP.S, required for particle export were rescued by interprotein interactions with wild-type S.

Using analytic Kolmogorov equations, we determine whether or not it is possible for individual incentives to drive noncooperation, even though cooperation would yield a better group outcome. We found that if all individuals have a cost of disclosure, then the optimal individual decision is to simply not disclose each other. With further analysis of (1) completely offsetting the costs of disclosure and (2) partially offsetting the costs of disclosure, we found that all individuals disclose all contacts, resulting in a smaller basic reproductive number and an alignment of individual and group optimality.

Lab-on-a-chip (LoC) systems represent a potentially high efficient class of PoC tools. Here, we present a LoC system for automated pathogen analysis of respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal specimens. The device prepares total nucleic acids from extracted swab samples using magnetic silica beads. After reverse transcription the co-purified viral RNA is amplified in accordance with the QIAplex multiplex PCR technology. Hybridized to corresponding QIAGEN LiquiChip beads and labelled with streptavidin R-phycoerythrin, the amplified target sequences are finally detected using a QIAGEN LiquiChip200 workstation. All chemicals needed are either stored freeze-dried on the disposable chip or are provided in liquid form in a reagent cartridge for up to 24 runs. Magnetic stir bars for mixing as well as turning valves with metering structures are integrated into the injection-moulded disposable chip. The core of the controlling instrument is a rotating heating bar construction providing fixed temperatures for fast cycling. PCR times of about half an hour (for 30 cycles) could be achieved for 120 \u03BCl reactions, making this system the fastest currently available high-volume PCR chip. The functionality of the system was shown by comparing automatically processed nasopharyngeal samples to ones processed manually according to the QIAGEN \u201CResPlex\u2122 II Panel v2.0\u201D respiratory virus detection kit.

Additionally we explored spatio-temporal patterns of virus occurrence in Canis lupus. Our study identified CPV DNA in all carnivore species with an overall prevalence of 91.9 %. CPV was detected in all sampled years and seasons in Canis lupus, supporting its enzootic nature. CDV RNA was mainly detected in the Canidae family, with viral nucleic acid recorded between 2005 and 2008 with a peak prevalence of 67 % among the wolf population, followed by a sharp decline, suggesting an epizootic behaviour of the virus. Antibodies show that mustelids and viverrids were often exposed to CDV. CCoV was first recorded by molecular methods in wolf samples in 2002, remaining in the wolf populations with marked fluctuations over time. The dual serological and molecular approach provided important epidemiological data on pathogens of wild carnivores in Portugal.

Recent studies indicate that STimulator of INterferon Gene (STING), canonically known for initiating a type I IFN production and innate immune response to cytosolic DNA, is required for host defense against neurotropic RNA viruses. We evaluated the role of STING in host defense to control WNV infection and pathology in a murine model of infection. When challenged with WNV, STING knock out (-/-) mice displayed increased morbidity and mortality compared to wild type (WT) mice. Virologic analysis and assessment of STING activation revealed that STING signaling was not required for control of WNV in the spleen nor was WNV sufficient to mediate canonical STING activation in vitro. However, STING-/- mice exhibited a clear trend of increased viral load and virus dissemination in the CNS. We found that STING-/- mice exhibited increased and prolonged neurological signs compared to WT mice. Pathological examination revealed increased lesions, mononuclear cellular infiltration and neuronal death in the CNS of STING-/- mice, with sustained pathology after viral clearance. We found that STING was required in bone marrow derived macrophages for early control of WNV replication and innate immune activation. In vivo, STING-/- mice developed an aberrant T cell response in both the spleen and brain during WNV infection that linked with increased and sustained CNS pathology compared to WT mice. Our findings demonstrate that STING plays a critical role in immune programming for the control of neurotropic WNV infection and CNS disease.","publish_time":"2019-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGuckin Wuertz, Kathryn; Treuting, Piper M.; Hemann, Emily A.; Esser-Nobis, Katharina; Snyder, Annelise G.; Graham, Jessica B.; Daniels, Brian P.; Wilkins, Courtney; Snyder, Jessica M.; Voss, Kathleen M.; Oberst, Andrew; Lund, Jennifer; Gale, Michael","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9579975ac947c6cce4c948e7bd7792de214b9abc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6695101.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31415679/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007899","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WNV","CNS","INterferon Gene"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["CNS of STING","role of STING","WNV sufficient","WNV infections","WT mice","assessment of STING activation","canonical STING activation","control of neurotropic WNV infection","early control of WNV replication","sustained CNS pathology","increased morbidity","CNS invasion","CNS disease","increased lesions","innate immune activation","innate immune response","sustained pathology","mortality","immune programming","innate immunity","clear trend of increased viral load","host defense","virus dissemination","spleen","re-emerging RNA virus","murine model of infection","neurotropic RNA viruses","West Nile Virus","neuronal death","IFN production","wild type","viral clearance","critical role","actions of interferon","STimulator of INterferon Gene","aberrant T cell response","leading source of arboviral encephalitic morbidity","mononuclear cellular infiltration","bone marrow derived macrophages","cytosolic DNA","prolonged neurological signs","peripheral tissues","central nervous system","Pathological examination","encephalitis","encephalomyelitis","Virologic analysis","brain","Recent studies","United States","findings"],"language":"en"},

Exposure to fugitive emissions generated during aerosol therapy increases the risk of the unnecessary inhalation of medication, as well as toxic side effects. Methods: This study examines fugitively-emitted aerosol emissions when nebulising albuterol sulphate, as a tracer aerosol, using two commercially available nebulisers in combination with an open or valved facemask or using a mouthpiece with and without a filter on the exhalation port. Each combination was connected to a breathing simulator during simulated adult breathing. The inhaled dose and residual mass were quantified using UV spectrophotometry. Time-varying fugitively-emitted aerosol concentrations and size distributions during nebulisation were recorded using aerodynamic particle sizers at two distances relative to the simulated patient. Different aerosol concentrations and size distributions were observed depending on the interface. Results: Within each nebuliser, the facemask combination had the highest time-averaged fugitively-emitted aerosol concentration, and values up to 0.072 \u00B1 0.001 mg m(\u22123) were recorded. The placement of a filter on the exhalation port of the mouthpiece yielded the lowest recorded concentrations. The mass median aerodynamic diameter of the fugitively-emitted aerosol was recorded as 0.890 \u00B1 0.044 \u00B5m, lower the initially generated medical aerosol in the range of 2\u20135 \u00B5m. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential secondary inhalation of exhaled aerosols from commercially available nebuliser facemask/mouthpiece combinations. The results will aid in developing approaches to inform policy and best practices for risk mitigation from fugitive emissions.","publish_time":"2019-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGrath, James A.; O\u2019Sullivan, Andrew; Bennett, Gavin; O\u2019Toole, Ciarra\u00ED; Joyce, Mary; Byrne, Miriam A.; MacLoughlin, Ronan","journal":"Pharmaceutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a1086d8acf9fe3ae22d83443b0935ecb80f3142a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6409895.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30759879/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics11020075","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emitted aerosol emissions","emitted aerosol concentrations","aerosol therapy","tracer aerosol","Different aerosol concentrations","facemask combination","Results","lowest recorded concentrations","fugitive emissions","available nebuliser facemask","Secondary inhalation of medical aerosols","size distributions","valved facemask","mouthpiece combinations","filter","exhalation port","\u00B5m","potential secondary inhalation of exhaled aerosols","unnecessary inhalation of medication","simulated adult breathing","risk mitigation","available nebulisers","breathing simulator","residual mass","mass median aerodynamic diameter","highest time","simulated patient","aerodynamic particle sizers","best practices","nebulisation","significant occupational hazard","policy","distances relative","albuterol sulphate","developing approaches","Background","study","homecare settings","inhaled dose","UV spectrophotometry","values","range","Exposure","Conclusions","placement","effects","Methods","interface"],"language":"en"},

In the present paper, SCMC was found to be enhanced following a 24-h incubation of leukocytes with swine influenza virus (SIV) of the H3N2 type, and with the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus. In most of our experiments, both SIV and TGEV induced interferon (IFN) production by leukocytes (titres ranging from 30-7,500 units/ml). When porcine leukocytes were incubated with TGEV in the presence of anti-IFN antiserum, no SCMC stimulation occurred, suggesting that the virus-induced SCMC stimulation was mainly due to endogenously produced IFN. On the other hand, when either human \u03B1IFN or porcine virus-induced IFN were added to porcine leukocytes, a rapid and marked SCMC increase was observed. Both the SIV-induced SCMC increase and IFN production were suppressed when SIV was UV-inactivated. On the contrary, UV-inactivated TGEV was still able to enhance SCMC and to induce IFN production by porcine leukocytes. On the whole, these results suggest that myxovirus and coronavirus are able to activate porcine leukocyte SCMC via endogenously produced IFN.","publish_time":"1983-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Charley, B.; Petit, E.; Laude, H.; La Bonnardi\u00E8re, C.","journal":"Annales de l\u0027Institut Pasteur / Virologie","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6d86dd9fa56d9d01412e3dbd4924881fe58894f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0769261783800471; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0769261783800471","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Koren"],"organizations":["SCMC","SIV","TGEV","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine leukocytes","porcine virus-induced IFN","SIV-induced SCMC","porcine leukocyte SCMC","IFN production","porcine blood leukocytes","virus-induced SCMC stimulation","porcine coronavirus","marked SCMC increase","TGEV induced interferon","h incubation of leukocytes","UV-inactivated TGEV","presence of anti-IFN antiserum","swine influenza virus","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","human \u03B1IFN","human myeloid tumour target cells","K562","Summary Spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity","H3N2 type","titres","Cr-release assay","myxovirus","experiments","Koren","results","hand","present paper","coworkers","units"],"language":"en"},

Many estimation methods require linking cases by direct transmission, a difficult task for most diseases. Using a subset of cases with detailed genetic or contact investigation data to develop a training set of probable transmission events, we build a model to estimate the relative transmission probability for all case-pairs from demographic, spatial and clinical data. Our method is based on naive Bayes, a machine learning classification algorithm which uses the observed frequencies in the training dataset to estimate the probability that a pair is linked given a set of covariates. In simulations we find that the probabilities estimated using genetic distance between cases to define training transmission events are able to distinguish between truly linked and unlinked pairs with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating curve value of 95%). Additionally only a subset of the cases, 10-50% depending on sample size, need to have detailed genetic data for our method to perform well. We show how these probabilities can be used to estimate the average effective reproductive number and apply our method to a tuberculosis outbreak in Hamburg, Germany. Our method is a novel way to infer transmission dynamics in any dataset when only a subset of cases has rich contact investigation and/or genetic data.

Specifically, we present a novel fully-annotated dataset of LUS images collected from several Italian hospitals, with labels indicating the degree of disease severity at a frame-level, videolevel, and pixel-level (segmentation masks). Leveraging these data, we introduce several deep models that address relevant tasks for the automatic analysis of LUS images. In particular, we present a novel deep network, derived from Spatial Transformer Networks, which simultaneously predicts the disease severity score associated to a input frame and provides localization of pathological artefacts in a weakly-supervised way. Furthermore, we introduce a new method based on uninorms for effective frame score aggregation at a video-level. Finally, we benchmark state of the art deep models for estimating pixel-level segmentations of COVID-19 imaging biomarkers.

Each year, over 70,000 organs are implanted worldwide. One donor may provide multiple organs, as well as corneas and other tissues, for multiple recipients. The degree of risk for transmission of infection carried with grafts, notably of viruses, is largely unknown and, for a specific organ, difficult to assess. The approach to microbiological screening of organ donors varies with national and regional regulations and with the availability and performance of microbiological assays used for potential donors. Transmission of both expected or common, and unexpected infections has been observed in organ transplants, generally recognized after development of clusters of infections among recipients of organs from a common donor. Other than for unusual or catastrophic events, few data exist that define the incidence and manifestations of donor-derived infections or the ideal assays to use in screening to prevent such transmissions. Absolute prevention of the transmission of donor-derived infections in organ transplantation is not possible. However, improvements in screening technologies will enhance the safety of transplantation in the future.

For example, we have recently shown that nasal administration of TNF\u03B1 produces late phase co-appearance of granulocyte and plasma exudation markers on the mucosal surface. The objective of the present study was to examine indices of granulocyte presence and activity in response to intranasal TNF\u03B1 challenge. METHODS: Healthy subjects and patients with allergic rhinitis (examined out of season) were subjected to nasal challenge with TNF\u03B1 (10 \u03BCg) in a sham-controlled and crossover design. Nasal lavages were carried out prior to and 24 hours post challenge. Nasal biopsies were obtained post challenge. Nasal lavage fluid levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) were analyzed as indices of neutrophil and eosinophil activity. Moreover, IL-8 and \u03B1(2)-macroglobulin were analyzed as markers of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and plasma exudation. Nasal biopsy numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils were monitored. RESULTS: Nasal lavage fluid levels of MPO recorded 24 hours post TNF\u03B1 challenge were increased in healthy subjects (p = 0.0081) and in patients with allergic rhinitis (p = 0.0081) (c.f. sham challenge). Similarly, \u03B1(2)-macroglobulin was increased in healthy subjects (p = 0.014) and in patients with allergic rhinitis (p = 0.0034). Lavage fluid levels of ECP and IL-8 were not affected by TNF\u03B1 challenge. TNF\u03B1 increased the numbers of subepithelial neutrophils (p = 0.0021), but not the numbers of eosinophils. CONCLUSION: TNF\u03B1 produces a nasal inflammatory response in humans that is characterised by late phase (i.e., 24 hours post challenge) neutrophil activity and plasma exudation.","publish_time":"2008-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Widegren, Henrik; Erjef\u00E4lt, Jonas; Korsgren, Magnus; Andersson, Morgan; Greiff, Lennart","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f89c1c613071fcb7fdb5d956e91a807b83456ea3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2253533.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18234086/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-9-15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MPO","ECP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nasal challenge","post challenge","nasal administration of TNF\u03B1","intranasal TNF\u03B1 challenge","sham challenge","Nasal biopsies","Nasal lavages","nasal inflammatory response","Nasal lavage fluid levels of MPO","Nasal lavage fluid levels of myeloperoxidase","Nasal biopsy numbers of neutrophils","patients","Healthy subjects","allergic rhinitis","hours","Lavage fluid levels of ECP","plasma exudation markers","eosinophil activity","neutrophil activity","numbers of eosinophils","indices of neutrophil","numbers of subepithelial neutrophils","macroglobulin","indices of granulocyte presence","late phase co-appearance of granulocyte","markers of pro-inflammatory cytokine production","eosinophil cationic protein","humans","mucosal surface","RESULTS","season","\u03BCg","present study","METHODS","CONCLUSION","pathophysiology of airway inflammation","objective","crossover design","BACKGROUND","example"],"language":"en"},

Cats with ICGN were more frequently FIV or FeLV-infected (OR:11.4; 95%CI:1.4\u201394.4; p = 0.024), had higher UPC ratio (OR:6.8; 95%CI:2.5\u201318.2; p \u003C 0.001) and were younger (OR:0.9; 95%CI:0.7\u20131.0; p = 0.042) than cats with non-ICGN. CONCLUSIONS: MGN and MPGN were the most common morphological diagnoses of ICGN in cats. Unfortunately, none of the investigated findings differentiated ICGN morphological diagnoses. Serum creatinine concentration and UPC ratio were directly associated with grades of CIN (p = 0.001 and p \u003C 0.001, respectively), confirming previous literature. More ICGN than non-ICGN was observed in cats with retroviral infections, younger cats and higher UPC ratio.","publish_time":"2019-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rossi, Francesco; Aresu, Luca; Martini, Valeria; Trez, Davide; Zanetti, Rossella; Coppola, Luigi Michele; Ferri, Filippo; Zini, Eric","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71d2ad06792c5adb2c8fb934e9bedc53659b1dfe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6702729.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429743/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2046-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICGN","International Renal Interest Society","CIN","MGN","MPGN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-ICGN","type of ICGN","ICGN morphological diagnoses","younger cats","common morphological diagnoses of ICGN","client-owned cats","higher UPC ratio","immune-complex glomerulonephritis","non-immune mediated origin","serum creatinine concentration","CIN grades","grades of CIN","mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis","membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis","FIV","MPGN","light","electron microscopy","clinico-pathological findings","MGN","Renal samples","renal dysplasia","comparisons","end-stage CKD","Clinico-pathological data","leukemia virus","FeLV-infected","investigated findings","chronic interstitial nephritis","feline immunodeficiency virus","Chronic kidney disease","SBP","status","systolic blood pressure","associations","urine protein","retroviral infections","Society","BACKGROUND","Signalment","IRIS","RESULTS","membranous glomerulonephropathy","addition","focal segmental glomerulosclerosis","multifocal mesangiosclerosis","MeGN","CONCLUSIONS","study","glomerular atrophy","previous literature","amyloidosis"],"language":"en"},

It is a continuing matter of debate under which circumstances HSV-1 is a relevant pathogen for pneumonitis. While its role during critical illness has been investigated by prospective interventional studies, comparatively little systematic data is available on the role of HSV-1 for pneumonitis in outpatients with autoimmune disease under a maintenance regimen of immunosuppression. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of ~1400 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that were followed at the outpatient clinic of a German University hospital during the years 2000\u20132007. Episodes of admission to a ward resulting in the diagnosis of pneumonia/pneumonitis were identified, and the type of pneumonia and clinical features retrospectively studied. RESULTS: 63 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, or SLE were admitted to a ward and diagnosed to have pneumonia/pneumonitis. Using bronchoscopy a total of 6 cases of pulmonary infection associated with HSV-1 in the lower respiratory tract were identified. Among those, 2 cases suggested a causative role of HSV-1 as the sole agent causing pneumonitis that proved clinically responsive to antiviral treatment. In the remaining 4 cases HSV-1 appeared as a bystander of bacterial infection. Maintenance therapy with leflunomide, which inhibits HSV-1 assembly in vitro, was associated with a milder course of pneumonitis in one patient. Detection of HSV-1 was associated with stronger immunosuppressive regimens and vasculitic disease. CONCLUSION: The present study analyzed the frequency and hallmarks of cases of HSV-1 associated pneumonitis that occurred in a comparatively large cohort of patients with rheumatologic autoimmune diseases. In an area of controversy, this study provides further evidence that HSV-1 causes isolated pneumonitis in the immunocompromised. The study may provide an estimate on the frequency of relevant HSV-1 infection and bacterial agents in outpatients with autoimmune disease.","publish_time":"2009-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Witt, Matthias N; Braun, Gerald S; Ihrler, Stephan; Schmid, Holger","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4016789973bc61cdb84c457c95e15426e2143b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2705343.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19450259/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2466-9-22","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases HSV","circumstances HSV","Detection of HSV","associated pneumonitis","frequency of relevant HSV","causative role of HSV","isolated pneumonitis","milder course of pneumonitis","cases of pulmonary infection","ill patients","hallmarks of cases","type of pneumonia","rheumatoid arthritis","vasculitis","large cohort of patients","outpatients","vasculitic disease","bystander of bacterial infection","SLE","present study","ward","diagnosis of pneumonia","rheumatologic autoimmune diseases","respiratory tract infections","lower respiratory tract","bacterial agents","relevant pathogen","Maintenance therapy","maintenance regimen of immunosuppression","Herpes simplex virus type","little systematic data","prospective interventional studies","German University hospital","systemic lupus erythematosus","stronger immunosuppressive regimens","outpatient clinic","BACKGROUND","total","evidence","estimate","continuing matter of debate","critical illness","sole agent","years","clinical features","charts","individuals","leflunomide","RESULTS","antiviral treatment","area of controversy","Episodes of admission","CONCLUSION","bronchoscopy","METHODS","assembly"],"language":"en"},

Although increasing evidence points to T cell immunity playing a critical role in vaccination against viral diseases, vaccine efficacy is mostly associated with the induction of antibody responses. Here we analyze the immunological mechanism(s) of rapidly protective vaccinia virus immunization using mousepox as surrogate model for human smallpox. We found that fast protection against lethal systemic poxvirus disease solely depended on CD4 and CD8 T cell responses induced by vaccination with highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) or conventional vaccinia virus. Of note, CD4 T cells were critically required to allow for MVA induced CD8 T cell expansion and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity was a key mechanism of MVA induced protection. In contrast, selected components of the innate immune system and B cell-mediated responses were fully dispensable for prevention of fatal disease by immunization given two days before challenge. In conclusion, our data clearly demonstrate that perforin-dependent CD8 T cell immunity plays a key role in MVA conferred short term protection against lethal mousepox. Rapid induction of T cell immunity might serve as a new paradigm for treatments that need to fit into a scenario of protective emergency vaccination.","publish_time":"2012-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kremer, Melanie; Suezer, Yasemin; Volz, Asisa; Frenz, Theresa; Majzoub, Monir; Hanschmann, Kay-Martin; Lehmann, Michael H.; Kalinke, Ulrich; Sutter, Gerd","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ba2641160cb0acdca16991443017f11d2d848c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3291617.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22396645/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MVA"],"locations":["Ankara"],"keyphrases":["CD8 T cell responses","MVA induced CD8 T cell expansion","Rapid induction of T cell immunity","perforin-dependent CD8 T cell immunity","B cell-mediated responses","key mechanism of MVA induced protection","rapid protection","CD4 T cells","protective vaccinia virus immunization","fast protection","scenario of protective emergency vaccination","conventional vaccinia virus","key role","short term protection","lethal mousepox","development of innovative vaccination principles","induction of antibody responses","attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara","perforin-mediated cytotoxicity","critical role","viral diseases","lethal systemic poxvirus disease","new paradigm","immunological mechanism","case of emergency","prevention of fatal disease","various infectious diseases","constant threat of new emerging pathogens","innate immune system","surrogate model","selected components","vaccine efficacy","human smallpox","days","increasing evidence","contrast","data","note","treatments","challenge","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

When the hosts are humans, emerging viruses can present major public health issues, as exemplified by the AIDS pandemic. Therefore, heuristic approaches to identify nascent diseases before they become pandemic would be valuable. Unfortunately, the current patient-based and epidemiological approaches are ill-suited in this regard because they are largely responsive and not predictive. Alternative approaches based on virus evolutionary ecology might have greater potential to predict virus emergence. However, given the difficulties encountered when studying metazoan viruses in this context, the development of new model systems is greatly desirable. Here, I highlight studies that show that bacteriophages are appropriate model organisms for virus emergence research because of the ease in which important population parameters can be manipulated. Ideally this research will permit identifying major factors determining the persistence or extinction of emerging viruses. If such viruses could be recognized in advance, patient-based and epidemiological strategies could be better mobilized to deal with them.","publish_time":"2009-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dennehy, John J.","journal":"Trends in Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54b1aa9288d2c87dfe3b26d6289b41c4dcdb6982.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127698.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2009.07.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X09001619; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X09001619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19765997/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["metazoan viruses","extinction of emerging viruses","epidemiological approaches","virus emergence research","Alternative approaches","heuristic approaches","virus evolutionary ecology","development of new model systems","major factors","epidemiological strategies","current patient","AIDS pandemic","appropriate model organisms","new host populations","major public health issues","greater potential","bacteriophages","context","persistence","nascent diseases","regard","ability","humans","important population parameters","hosts","advance","studies","difficulties"],"language":"en"},

However, others, including cardiovascular conditions, do not follow clear linear patterns of change with economic development. Abnormal blood pressure is a serious health risk factor with consequences for population growth and longevity as well as public and private expenditure in health care and labor productivity. This also increases the risk of the population in certain pandemics, such as COVID-19. To determine the correlation of income and blood pressure, we analyzed time-series for the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of men\u2019s population (mmHg) and nominal Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPPC) for 136 countries from 1980 to 2008 using regression and statistical analysis by Pearson\u2019s correlation (r). Our study finds a trend similar to an inverted-U shaped curve, or a \u2018Heart Kuznets Curve\u2019. There is a positive correlation (increase GDPPC, increase SBP) in low-income countries, and a negative correlation in high-income countries (increase GDPPC, decrease SBP). As country income rises people tend to change their diets and habits and have better access to health services and education, which affects blood pressure. However, the latter two may not offset the rise in blood pressure until countries reach a certain income. Investing early in health education and preventive health care could avoid the sharp increase in blood pressure as countries develop, and therefore, avoiding the \u2018Heart Kuznets Curve\u2019 and its economic and human impacts.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagano, Hitoshi; Puppim de Oliveira, Jose A.; Barros, Allan Kardec; Costa Junior, Altair da Silva","journal":"World Dev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61aa9cb4a35f1dd472fcb1855c8aad25c48c395c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190509.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362711/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305750X20300796; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20300796; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.104953","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":["Gross Domestic Product","SBP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Abnormal blood pressure","health education","health indicators","health services","mean systolic blood pressure","increase GDPPC","low-income countries","high-income countries","correlation of income","preventive health care","SBP","serious health risk factor","negative correlation","Pearson\u2019s correlation","sharp increase","positive correlation","certain income","Heart Kuznets Curve","population growth","men\u2019s population","country income","economic development","inverted-U shaped curve","certain pandemics","clear linear patterns of change","mmHg","consequences","better access","private expenditure","nominal Gross Domestic Product","time-series","longevity","statistical analysis","regression","trend similar","child mortality","labor productivity","diets","habits","people","rise","well-defined trends","cardiovascular conditions","human impacts","study","COVID"],"language":"en"},

Yet, as the nature and scale of future pandemics cannot be adequately estimated, it is difficult to justify construction of sufficient isolation facilities. A fast-track and cost-effective ventilation strategy for the retrofitting of existing general wards could help hospitals deal with patient surges. Aim This article reviews the effectiveness of a fast-track, makeshift isolation approach employed during the SARS outbreak which involved installing simple window-mounted exhaust fans to create negative-pressure airflow in hospital general wards. Methods Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to assess by simulation whether the approach adopted meets US Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention requirements for properly constructed isolation wards. Findings CFD simulation revealed that this makeshift approach could match the ventilation standards of isolation rooms. The approach was certainly effective as no secondary infections were reported in hospitals that used it during SARS. Conclusions When there is a shortfall in isolation facilities to accommodate a surge in patients, the proposed ventilation set-up could be quickly and widely implemented by existing general wards.","publish_time":"2012-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuen, P.

However, if children continue mixing with others outside the home during closures, the effect of these measures may be limited. AIM: This review aimed to summarise existing literature on children\u2019s activities and contacts made outside the home during unplanned school closures. METHODS: In February 2020, we searched four databases, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase and Web of Science, from inception to 5 February 2020 for papers published in English or Italian in peer-reviewed journals reporting on primary research exploring children\u2019s social activities during unplanned school closures. Main findings were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 3,343 citations were screened and 19 included in the review. Activities and social contacts appeared to decrease during closures, but contact remained common. All studies reported children leaving the home or being cared for by non-household members. There was some evidence that older child age (two studies) and parental disagreement (two studies) with closure were predictive of children leaving the home, and mixed evidence regarding the relationship between infection status and such. Parental agreement with closure was generally high, but some disagreed because of perceived low risk of infection and issues regarding childcare and financial impact. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that many children continue to leave home and mix with others during school closures despite public health recommendations to avoid social contact. This review of behaviour during unplanned school closures could be used to improve infectious disease modelling.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brooks, Samantha K; Smith, Louise E; Webster, Rebecca K; Weston, Dale; Woodland, Lisa; Hall, Ian; Rubin, G James","journal":"Euro Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c46cf82f773d96e7ec8b9f7ffdcaa73169d3e2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7140596.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32265006/; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2020.25.13.2000188","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unplanned school closures","home","Emergency school closures","studies","children\u2019s social activities","children\u2019s activities","social contacts","predictive of children","spread of infection","infection status","mixed evidence","review of behaviour","public health recommendations","public health interventions","infectious disease outbreaks","infectious disease modelling","perceived low risk of infection","parental disagreement","Parental agreement","issues","primary research","peer-reviewed journals","PsycInfo","Embase","Italian","existing literature","Web of Science","older child age","MEDLINE","English","relationship","financial impact","inception","papers","databases","effect","BACKGROUND","non-household members","RESULTS","total","citations","measures","CONCLUSION","Main findings","AIM","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

I describe the application of an emergency department (ED) disaster response plan to manage the SARS outbreak. Methods The ED implemented protection for staff, patients, and facility; infection control measures; and disaster-response workflow changes. The Ministry of Health, Singapore, centralized SARS cases in the hospital, and the ED became the national screening center. A screening questionnaire and a set of admission criteria were applied after assessment of clinical features and chest radiograph findings. Results For the duration of the outbreak that ended on May 31, 2003, the ED screened 11,461 persons for SARS, of whom 1,386 (12.9%) were admitted to rule out SARS and 235 (17%) were confirmed to have SARS. Among 10,075 persons discharged from the ED, there were 28 reattending patients who were admitted and diagnosed with SARS, giving an undertriage rate of 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1% to 0.4%). The sensitivity of an ED admission for SARS was 89.4% (95% CI 85.6% to 93.1%), and specificity was 89.7% (95% CI 89.2% to 90.3%). The positive predictive value was 17% (95% CI 15.7% to 18.4%), and the negative predictive value was 99.7% (95% CI 99.6% to 99.8%). No patient contracted SARS as a result of an ED visit. After full implementation of protective measures, 1 ED nurse with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus was treated for suspected SARS. Conclusion Although the SARS outbreak was not a bioterrorism event, the ED disaster response was applicable in the outbreak\u0027s management. The use of a screening questionnaire and admission criteria enabled the ED to screen, treat, and safely discharge the majority of the patients.","publish_time":"2004-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tham, Kum-Ying","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fed25ff0258eede38fd1bf90395556aa61c9afb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124311.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019606440300828X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019606440300828X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["SARS","The Ministry of Health, Singapore"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS outbreak","ED admission","suspected SARS","ED nurse","ED visit","ED disaster response","centralized SARS cases","patient contracted SARS","screening questionnaire","disaster response plan","disaster-response workflow changes","set of admission criteria","outbreak of atypical pneumonia","reattending patients","persons","national screening center","positive predictive value","negative predictive value","Singapore physicians","infection control measures","implementation of protective measures","undiagnosed diabetes mellitus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","assessment of clinical features","bioterrorism event","emergency department","facility","staff","chest radiograph findings","Ministry of Health","protection","hospital","outbreak\u0027s management","Abstract Study objective","Methods","application","use","sensitivity","Results","duration","confidence interval","undertriage rate","Conclusion","majority","specificity"],"language":"en"},

However, no rationale for how to prioritize service shut down and patient care exists. A consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily triage allergy/immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus. During the ongoing pandemic while social distancing is being encouraged, most allergy/immunology care could be postponed/delayed or handled through virtual care. With the exception of many patients with primary immunodeficiency, patients on venom immunotherapy, and patients with asthma of a certain severity, there is limited need for face-to-face visits under such conditions. These suggestions are intended to help provide a logical approach to quickly adjust service to mitigate risk to both medical staff and patients. Importantly, individual community circumstances may be unique and require contextual consideration. The decision to enact any of these measures rests with the judgment of each clinician and individual health care system. Pandemics are unanticipated, and enforced social distancing/quarantining is highly unusual. This expert panel consensus document offers a prioritization rational to help guide decision making when such situations arise and an allergist/immunologist is forced to reduce services or makes the decision on his or her own to do so.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shaker, Marcus S.; Oppenheimer, John; Grayson, Mitchell; Stukus, David; Hartog, Nicholas; Hsieh, Elena W.Y.; Rider, Nicholas; Dutmer, Cullen M.; Vander Leek, Timothy K.; Kim, Harold; Chan, Edmond S.; Mack, Doug; Ellis, Anne K.; Lang, David; Lieberman, Jay; Fleischer, David; Golden, David B.K.; Wallace, Dana; Portnoy, Jay; Mosnaim, Giselle; Greenhawt, Matthew","journal":"J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/805adf0cb36778d9154e43f7070f2368cbfca9b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195089.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213219820302531; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.03.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213219820302531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32224232/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Delphi"],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States","Canada"],"keyphrases":["patients","immunology care","immunology services","patient care","decision","expert panel of allergy","virtual care","adjustment of ambulatory allergy services","expert panel consensus document","immunology specialists","social distancing","individual health care system","patient prioritization schematic","consensus-based ad","prioritization rational","drastic measures","measures rests","ongoing pandemic","global infectious pandemic","individual community circumstances","clinician","Canada","primary immunodeficiency","venom immunotherapy","limited need","United States","certain severity","asthma","judgment","face-to-face visits","adapted modified Delphi methodology","risk","medical staff","conditions","event","situations","immunologist","exception","quarantining","contextual consideration","allergist","Pandemics","logical approach","Recommendations","feedback","rationale","suggestions"],"language":"en"},

Sequential extraction experiments showed that, after SCW treatment, heavy metals in exchangeable and carbonate forms in the ashes could be transferred into other relatively stable forms, e.g., Ba and Cr into residual fraction, Cu and Pb into organic matter fraction. SCWH treatment could stabilize heavy metals in Fe\u2013Mn oxides and residual fractions. However, the behavior of As was quite different from heavy metals, which could be leached out from residue fraction after SCW and SWCH treatments. The leached As tended to absorb onto Fe\u2013Mn oxides and organic matters under near neutral environment, but it could react with Ca2\u002B at lower pH, increasing the mobility of this element. Therefore, it is necessary to neutralize acidic ash to near neutral condition before subjecting it to SCW and SCWH treatments so as to effectively stabilize hazardous elements in the ash. Consequently, it is believed that SCWH treatment is an effective alternative for hazardous elements detoxification in MW fly ash.","publish_time":"2009-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bo, Da; Zhang, Fu-Shen; Zhao, Lijuan","journal":"Journal of Hazardous Materials","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f3a074cf50bbc8bc2fbbe209bf4dc980d9006d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115779.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389409007316; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389409007316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19482422/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.04.134","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCW","SCWH","SWCH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SCW treatment","SCWH treatments","heavy metals","MW fly ash","Mn oxides","organic matter fraction","residue fraction","acidic ash","SWCH treatments","incinerator fly ashes","hazardous elements detoxification","near neutral condition","organic matters","residual fractions","carbonate forms","neutral environment","stable forms","different types of incinerators","Cu","medical waste","effective alternative","Pb","Ba","supercritical water","work","H2O2","mobility","lower pH","Abstract","Sequential extraction experiments","Ca2","behavior"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, delayed induction of the IL-12R\u03B22 receptor component following STAT1 activation helped ensure that Treg cells do not readily complete STAT4-dependent Th1 cell development and lose their ability to suppress effector T cell proliferation.

A generic and scalable method has been described in this study to efficiently produce AAV serotypes (AAV1-9) by transfection of a fully characterized cGMP HEK293SF cell line grown in suspension and serum-free medium. First, the production parameters were evaluated using AAV2 as a model serotype. Second, all nine AAV serotypes were produced successfully with yields of 1013 Vg/L cell culture. Subsequently, AAV2 and AAV6 serotypes were produced in 3-L controlled bioreactors where productions yielded up to 1013 Vg/L similar to the yields obtained in shake-flasks. For example, for AAV2 1013 Vg/L cell culture (6.8\u00D71011 IVP/L) were measured between 48 and 64h post transfection (hpt). During this period, the average cell specific AAV2 yields of 6800Vg per cell and 460IVP per cell were obtained with a Vg to IVP ratio of less than 20.

Similar to other coronaviruses, spike (S)-glycoprotein of the virus interacts with a cellular receptor and mediates membrane fusion to allow viral entry into susceptible target cells. Accordingly, S-protein plays an important role in virus infection cycle and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. To begin to understand its biochemical and immunological properties, we expressed both full-length and ectodomain of the protein in various primate cells. Our results show that the protein has an electrophoretic mobility of about 160\u2013170 kDa. The protein is glycosylated with high mannose and/or hybrid oligosaccharides, which account for approximately 30 kDa of the apparent protein mass. The detection of S-protein by immunoassays was difficult using human convalescent sera, suggesting that the protein may not elicit strong humoral immune response in virus-infected patients. We were able to pseudotype murine leukemia virus particles with S-protein and produce SARS pseudoviruses. Pseudoviruses infected Vero E6 cells in a pH-independent manner and the infection could be specifically inhibited by convalescent sera. Consistent with low levels of antibodies against S-protein, neutralizing activity was weak with 50% neutralization titers ranging between 1:15 to 1:25. To facilitate quantifying pseudovirus-infected cells, which are stained blue with X-Gal, we devised an automated procedure using an ELISPOT analyzer. The high-throughput capacity of this procedure and the safety of using SARS pseudoviruses should make possible large-scale analyses of neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2004-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Dong P; Kim, Hyung G; Kim, Young B; Poon, Leo L.M; Cho, Michael W","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6416d311b8e5e360921299299fc25f039aac823a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127165.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682204003678; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682204003678","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ELISPOT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S-protein","SARS pseudoviruses","apparent protein mass","detection of S","virus-infected patients","Pseudoviruses infected Vero E6 cells","virus infection cycle","susceptible target cells","quantifying pseudovirus-infected cells","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","various primate cells","primary target of neutralizing antibodies","kDa","murine leukemia virus particles","human convalescent sera","automated procedure","high mannose","possible large-scale analyses of neutralizing antibody responses","low levels of antibodies","high-throughput capacity","immunoassays","viral entry","strong humoral immune response","important role","etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome","membrane fusion","pH-independent manner","stained blue","X-Gal","hybrid oligosaccharides","cellular receptor","spike","ectodomain","safety","activity","immunological properties","account","ELISPOT analyzer","coronaviruses","glycoprotein","neutralization titers","electrophoretic mobility","results"],"language":"en"},

The modal initial dosage of oral prednisolone was 40 mg for the adult and 30 mg for the child, and modal duration of oral steroid dosage was 5 days for both adult and child. Planned follow-up was mainly doctor initiated within 24 h of initial consultation. There was low reported use of self-management plans (49% for adults and 33% in children over 7 years of age). Antibiotic prescription appears to be common practice by GPs when faced with an acute asthma attack associated with respiratory tract infection. There may also be inadequate duration of oral steroid courses in adults.

It states that the origins of veterinary medicine are rooted in efforts to maintain the health of animals for food and fiber production and animals essential for work-related activities. The early phase of virology was one of skepticism and uncertainty because of the limited tools available to define the filterable agents. Even with filtration, there were differences among the agents as to their size as defined by filter retention. The bacterial viruses assisted in defining some of the basic principles of genetics through the study of mutations and the inheritance of phenotypic changes. Veterinary virology began as a discipline focusing on the effects of viral infections on animals of agricultural significance. Control of these infections relied on advances in understanding the disease process, in the characterization of the viruses, in the development of the fields of immunology and diagnostic technologies, and in the establishment of regulations controlling the movement of production animals. Initial experiences confirmed that eradication of some infectious diseases from defined areas could be achieved with a test and slaughter program, even in the absence of an effective vaccine.

Vaccine development against this pathogen has been delayed after the detrimental effects produced in children by vaccination with a formalin-inactivated hRSV preparation (FI-hRSV), which caused enhanced disease upon natural viral infection. Since then, several studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms underlying such disease exacerbation. Along these lines, several studies have suggested that antibodies elicited by immunization with FI-hRSV show low neutralizing capacity and promote the formation of immune complexes containing hRSV (hRSV-ICs), which contribute to hRSV pathogenesis through the engagement of Fc gamma receptors (Fc\u03B3Rs) expressed on the surface of immune cells. Furthermore, a role for Fc\u03B3Rs is supported by studies evaluating the contribution of these molecules to hRSV-induced disease. These studies have shown that Fc\u03B3Rs can modulate viral clearance by the host and the inflammatory response triggered by hRSV infection. In addition, ICs can facilitate viral entry into host cells expressing Fc\u03B3Rs, thus extending hRSV infectivity. In this article, we discuss current knowledge relative to the contribution of hRSV-ICs and Fc\u03B3Rs to the pathogenesis caused by hRSV and their putative role in the exacerbation of the disease caused by this virus after FI-hRSV vaccination. A better understanding Fc\u03B3Rs involvement in the immune response against hRSV will contribute to the development of new prophylactic or therapeutic tools to promote virus clearance with limited inflammatory damage to the airways.","publish_time":"2019-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Acevedo, Orlando A.; D\u00EDaz, Fabi\u00E1n E.; Beals, Tomas E.; Benavente, Felipe M.; Soto, Jorge A.; Escobar-Vera, Jorge; Gonz\u00E1lez, Pablo A.; Kalergis, Alexis M.","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/889915a03b21c44b0c3d21f13fb8d04a7cdd0f50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6450440.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2019.00075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984626/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hRSV-ICs","hRSV infection","contribution of hRSV","hRSV pathogenesis","hRSV symptoms","hRSV infectivity","FI-hRSV vaccination","hRSV-induced disease","formalin-inactivated hRSV preparation","studies","immune response","inflammatory response","virus clearance","disease exacerbation","excessive host immune","viral clearance","better understanding Fc\u03B3Rs involvement","host cells","enhanced disease","natural viral infection","surface of immune cells","human Respiratory Syncytial Virus","formation of immune complexes","respiratory tissue","viral entry","limited inflammatory damage","putative role","Vaccine development","leading cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract infections","main cause of hospitalization","development of new prophylactic","ALRTIs","therapeutic tools","non-optimal immunological memory","low neutralizing capacity","engagement of Fc gamma receptors","pneumonia","life","molecules","current knowledge relative","asthma","humans","children","ages","immunization","detrimental effects","bronchiolitis","article","airways","addition","antibodies","mechanisms","infants","lines"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-metastatic activities of DMGF on the metastatic processes of melanoma cells in vivo and in vitro. A transwell assay showed that DMGF could effectively attenuate the motility of B16F10 cells, and the results of real-time PCR revealed that DMGF also suppressed the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Moreover, DMGF did not influence tube formation but inhibited the migration of endothelial cells. Furthermore, animal models were used to monitor the effects of DMGF on tumor metastasis, and all models showed that DMGF significantly suppressed the metastatic behaviors of B16F10 cells, including intravasation, colonization, and invasion of the lymphatic duct. In addition, DMGF could also reduce the densities of the blood vessels in the tumor area in vivo. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms of anti-metastatic activity revealed that DMGF can down-regulate the levels of key modulators of the Cdc42/Rac1 pathway to interfere in F-actin polymerization and suppress the formation of lamellipodia by reducing the phosphorylation of CREB. These data suggested that DMGF presents anti-metastatic activities in B16F10 melanoma cells. Here, we demonstrated that DMGF can inhibit the metastasis of highly invasive melanoma cancer cells through the down-regulation of F-actin polymerization. Considering these findings, DMGF may be further developed to serve as a chemoprevention drug for patients with metastatic melanoma.","publish_time":"2016-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Ching-Min; Lin, Yu-Ling; Ho, Shu-Yi; Chen, Pin-Rong; Tsai, Yi-Hsuan; Chung, Chen-Han; Hwang, Chia-Hsiang; Tsai, Nu-Man; Tzou, Shey-Cherng; Ke, Chun-Yen; Chang, Jung; Chan, Yi-Lin; Wang, Yu-Shan; Chi, Kwan-Hwa; Liao, Kuang-Wen","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4f0d1b957340175fd951c8fa9c27815dd589f26.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5601121.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28947953/; https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.10960","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DMGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of DMGF","anti-metastatic activities of DMGF","metastatic melanoma","B16F10 melanoma cells","metastatic processes of melanoma cells","metastatic behaviors of B16F10 cells","motility of B16F10 cells","invasive melanoma cancer cells","tumor metastasis","migration of endothelial cells","molecular mechanisms of anti-metastatic activity","F-actin polymerization","tumor area","formation of lamellipodia","regulation of F","tube formation","animal models","Hicksii","Cdc42","Rac1 pathway","colonization","intravasation","levels of key modulators","invasion","media","blood vessels","biflavonoid","chemoprevention drug","patients","results of real-time PCR","autophagic cell death","expressions of matrix metalloproteinase","Taxus","investigation","densities","study","data","lymphatic duct","phosphorylation of CREB","MMP","transwell assay","Dimethoxyagastisflavone","aim","addition","findings"],"language":"en"},

However, within the large Nsp3 (1922 amino-acid residues), the structure and function of the so-called SARS-unique domain (SUD) have remained elusive. SUD occurs only in SARS-CoV and the highly related viruses found in certain bats, but is absent from all other coronaviruses. Therefore, it has been speculated that it may be involved in the extreme pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, compared to other coronaviruses, most of which cause only mild infections in humans. In order to help elucidate the function of the SUD, we have determined crystal structures of fragment 389\u2013652 (\u201CSUD(core)\u201D) of Nsp3, which comprises 264 of the 338 residues of the domain. Both the monoclinic and triclinic crystal forms (2.2 and 2.8 \u00C5 resolution, respectively) revealed that SUD(core) forms a homodimer. Each monomer consists of two subdomains, SUD-N and SUD-M, with a macrodomain fold similar to the SARS-CoV X-domain. However, in contrast to the latter, SUD fails to bind ADP-ribose, as determined by zone-interference gel electrophoresis. Instead, the entire SUD(core) as well as its individual subdomains interact with oligonucleotides known to form G-quadruplexes. This includes oligodeoxy- as well as oligoribonucleotides. Mutations of selected lysine residues on the surface of the SUD-N subdomain lead to reduction of G-quadruplex binding, whereas mutations in the SUD-M subdomain abolish it. As there is no evidence for Nsp3 entering the nucleus of the host cell, the SARS-CoV genomic RNA or host-cell mRNA containing long G-stretches may be targets of SUD. The SARS-CoV genome is devoid of G-stretches longer than 5\u20136 nucleotides, but more extended G-stretches are found in the 3\u2032-nontranslated regions of mRNAs coding for certain host-cell proteins involved in apoptosis or signal transduction, and have been shown to bind to SUD in vitro. Therefore, SUD may be involved in controlling the host cell\u0027s response to the viral infection. Possible interference with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-like domains is also discussed.","publish_time":"2009-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Jinzhi; Vonrhein, Clemens; Smart, Oliver S.; Bricogne, Gerard; Bollati, Michela; Kusov, Yuri; Hansen, Guido; Mesters, Jeroen R.; Schmidt, Christian L.; Hilgenfeld, Rolf","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f962f74bcf72c06a4f0941b8da40742024dae3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2674928.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19436709/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000428","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entire SUD","SARS-CoV genome","SARS-CoV X-domain","SUD-N subdomain lead","SARS-CoV genomic RNA","extreme pathogenicity of SARS","so-called SARS-unique domain","transcriptase components of SARS coronavirus","reduction of G","devoid of G","G-quadruplexes","long G-stretches","extended G-stretches","core","certain host-cell proteins","host-cell mRNA","host cell\u0027s response","ADP-ribose","function","large Nsp3","coronaviruses","Mutations of selected lysine residues","amino-acid residues","triclinic crystal forms","crystal structures of fragment","certain bats","non-structural proteins","Possible interference","individual subdomains","three-dimensional structures","zone-interference gel electrophoresis","replicase","surface","nontranslated regions of mRNAs coding","apoptosis","quadruplex binding","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","related viruses","macrodomain fold similar","viral infection","polymerase","oligonucleotides","nucleus","signal transduction","\u00C5 resolution","mild infections","humans","Nsps","evidence","monomer","homodimer","oligoribonucleotides","order","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Viral metagenomic data, which can contain sequences of both known and novel viruses, provide new opportunities for characterizing RNA viruses. Although there are a number of pipelines for analyzing viruses in metagenomic data, they have different limitations. First, viruses that lack closely related reference genomes cannot be detected with high sensitivity. Second, strain-level analysis is usually missing. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a hybrid pipeline named TAR-VIR that reconstructs viral strains without relying on complete or high-quality reference genomes. It is optimized for identifying RNA viruses from metagenomic data by combining an effective read classification method and our in-house strain-level de novo assembly tool. TAR-VIR was tested on both simulated and real viral metagenomic data sets. The results demonstrated that TAR-VIR competes favorably with other tested tools. CONCLUSION: TAR-VIR can be used standalone for viral strain reconstruction from metagenomic data. Or, its read recruiting stage can be used with other de novo assembly tools for superior viral functional and taxonomic analyses.

Additionally, much of the population, such as the aged or immunocompromised, are unable to mount an effective immunologic response for existing vaccines. Vectored Immunoprophylaxis (VIP) is a novel approach designed to address these challenges. Rather than utilizing an antigen to trigger a response from the host\u2019s immune system as is normally done with traditional vaccines, VIP genetically engineers the production of tailored antibodies from non-hematopoietic cells, bypassing the humoral immune system. Direct administration of genes encoding for neutralizing antibodies has proven to be effective in both preventing and treating several infectious diseases in animal models. While, a significant amount of work has focused on HIV, including an ongoing clinical trial, the approach has also been shown to be effective for malaria, dengue, hepatitis C, influenza, and more. In addition to presenting itself as a potentially efficient approach to solving long-standing vaccine challenges, the approach may be the best, if not only, method to vaccinate immunocompromised individuals. Many issues still need to be addressed, including which tissue(s) makes the most suitable platform, which vector(s) are most efficient at transducing the platform tissue used to secrete the antibodies, and what are the long-term effects of such a treatment.

Summary Objective To compare H1N1 (2009) influenza A infection characteristics between transplant recipient patients and non-transplanted patients. To assess the evolution of transplanted patients up to 6months following infection. Methods Patients diagnosed with confirmed influenza A infection from three Parisian transplant centers between September 1st, 2009 and February 15th, 2010. Clinical symptoms, biological, and radiological findings, and management were analysed and retrospectively compared between transplanted (T) and non-transplanted patients (NT). The evolution was assessed by a follow-up questionnaire, CT results 1 to 3months after influenza infection and FEV1 variation. Results Seventy patients were included. Thirteen patients had an allograft (lung: eight, kidney: four, stem cells: one): (1) hospitalization: 100% (13 out of 13) in group T, 54% (31 out of 57) in group NT (P =0.0013); (2) pneumonia: 62% (eight out of 13) in group T, 26% (eight out of 57) in group NT (P =0.004); (3) mortality rate among hospitalized patients: 7.7% (one out of 13) in the group T, 9.7% (three out of 57) in group NT (P =NS); (4) chest CT scan abnormalities remained in four lung transplanted patients; (5) a minimum 10% decrease in FEV1 was detected in four lung transplant recipients. Conclusion Our results suggest that H1N1(2009) influenza A infection in transplant recipient patients compared to non-transplanted patients: (1) more often leads to hospitalization; (2) is more frequently associated with pneumonia; (3) is responsible for a persistent graft functional impairment in lung transplant recipients; (4) has a low mortality rate similar to admitted non-transplanted patients.","publish_time":"2011-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crockett, F.; Mal, H.; Amazzough, K.; Stern, M.; Rivaud, E.; Cerf, C.; Matthieu, E.; Honderlick, P.; Scherrer, A.; Couderc, L.-J.","journal":"Revue de Pneumologie Clinique","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5d3dcdd7bb6d2db32c7318796ac7272f2229701.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126570.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761841711000794; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761841711000794","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients transplant\u00E9s pulmonaires","celles des patients","M\u00E9thodes Patients","patients greff\u00E9s pulmonaires","celle des patients hospitalis\u00E9s","infection in transplant recipient patients compared to","infection characteristics between transplant recipient patients","in group NT","scan abnormalities remained in four lung transplanted patients","in the group","Results Seventy patients were included","mortality rate among hospitalized patients","Thirteen patients had an allograft","Methods Patients diagnosed with confirmed influenza","eight out","decrease in FEV1 was detected in four lung transplant recipients","three out","graft functional impairment in lung transplant recipients","months after influenza infection","retrospectively compared between transplanted","To assess the evolution","months following infection","Summary Objective To","caract\u00E9ristiques de la grippe","more often leads to hospitalization","infection from three Parisian transplant centers between September","low mortality rate similar to admitted","Conclusion Our results suggest that H1N1","FEV1 variation","The evolution was assessed","questionnaire","r\u00E9sultats biologiques","\u00E9volution","VEMS","hospitalisation","is more frequently associated with pneumonia","mortalit\u00E9 similaire","\u00E9tude de la variation","taux de mortalit\u00E9","management were analysed","is responsible for","radiological findings","alt\u00E9ration fonctionnelle respiratoire persistante","kidney","chest","rein","minimum","traitement","biological","r\u00E9alisation","scanner thoracique","mois","persistance","semestre suivant","anomalies scanographiques","Clinical symptoms","stem cells","cellules souches h\u00E9matopo\u00EF\u00E9tiques","centres parisiens de transplantation","sympt\u00F4mes","poumons","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Objectif","February","diminution","origine","pneumonies"],"language":"fr"},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of Isatis indigotica extracts on human leukemia cell line (HL-60) and the antiviral activity on swine pseudorabies virus (PrV) in in vitro assays. Materials and methods Extracts and derived fractions of Isatis indigotica were prepared from root (R) and leaf (L) using methanol (M), ethyl acetate (E) and distilled water (D). The cytotoxic effect of extracts on swine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and HL-60 was assessed by MTT method. The cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction, plaque reduction and inhibition assays on viral replication, and virucidal activity were further conducted to investigate the anti-PrV activity. Results Indirubin, one of the biological active compounds of Isatis indigotica, had the most significant cytotoxicity on HL-60 cells and inhibitory effect on PrV replication. Extracts from roots and leaves of Isatis indigotica also presented CPE inhibition either before or after infection of PrV on porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. Leaf extracts had better virucidal activity than roots, and ethyl acetate extracts exhibited the highest efficacy among extracts tested. Conclusion Isatis indigotica posses a valuable virucidal effect in disease control of pseudorabies virus infection in swine.","publish_time":"2009-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsuan, Shih-Ling; Chang, Shih-Chieh; Wang, Sheng-Yang; Liao, Tien-Ling; Jong, Ting-Ting; Chien, Maw-Sheng; Lee, Wei-Cheng; Chen, Shih-Shiung; Liao, Jiunn-Wang","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d04931d795b87d97de6fbf013206543af8961ace.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126793.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19429341/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2009.02.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874109001202; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874109001202","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MTT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cytotoxicity of Isatis indigotica extracts","study Isatis indigotica","leaves of Isatis indigotica","Leaf extracts","cytotoxic effect of extracts","Conclusion Isatis indigotica posses","derived fractions of Isatis indigotica","ethyl acetate extracts","anti-PrV activity","biological active compounds of Isatis indigotica","infection of PrV","PrV replication","valuable virucidal effect","better virucidal activity","anti-leukemia","inhibitory effect","cytopathic effect","antiviral activity","swine pseudorabies virus","roots","CPE inhibition","inhibition assays","swine peripheral blood mononuclear cells","disease control of pseudorabies virus infection","plaque reduction","viral replication","significant cytotoxicity","Abstract Aim","anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome","human leukemia cell line","SARS","PBMCs","Chinese medicine","highest efficacy","distilled water","porcine kidney","methods","PK","Materials","methanol","Cruciferae","Results Indirubin","MTT method"],"language":"en"},

A single nucleotide polymorphism located in IFNL4, which determines the ability to express IFN\u03BB4, has been correlated with poor spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. We show that IFN\u03BB4 is an active type III IFN that induces a typical subset of ISGs, signals through the classical type III IFN receptor complex and is antiviral against HCV and coronaviruses. However, its secretion is impaired and this impairment is caused by a yet unknown molecular determinant, but appears to be partially caused by a weak signal peptide and inefficient N-linked glycosylation. This glycosylation is not required for antiviral activity and secretion of IFN\u03BB4, but seems to improve its processing. The impaired secretion of IFN\u03BB4 appears to be a recently acquired feature of primates. A single amino acid substitution in IFN\u03BB4 changing a proline at position 70 to a serine (P70S) alters its activity. We demonstrate that the IFN\u03BB4-S70 variant has a significantly lower antiviral activity compared to IFN\u03BB4-P70. Our subsequent genetic study on a cohort of patients infected with HCV shows that individuals, who encode IFN\u03BB4-S70, display lower hepatic ISG expression, better treatment response rates and better spontaneous clearance rates than patients encoding IFN\u03BB4-P70. This study provides important evidence supporting a role for active IFN\u03BB4 as the driver of high hepatic ISG expression as well as the cause of poor HCV clearance.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Terczynska-Dyla, Ewa; Bibert, Stephanie; Duong, Francois H.T.; Lauber, Chris; Gad, Hans Henrik; Kaderali, Lars; Heim, Markus H.; Bochud, Pierre-Yves; Hartmann, Rune","journal":"Cytokine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466615003944; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466615003944","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["ISG","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["active IFN\u03BB4","IFN\u03BB4-P70","impaired secretion of IFN\u03BB4","IFN\u03BB4-S70 variant","lower antiviral activity","active type","cause of poor HCV clearance","better spontaneous clearance rates","lower hepatic ISG expression","classical type","IFNL4","better treatment response rates","driver of high hepatic ISG expression","treatment-induced clearance of hepatitis C virus","cohort of patients","IFN receptor complex","subsequent genetic study","single nucleotide polymorphism","inefficient N-linked glycosylation","single amino acid substitution","interferon \u03BB family","signals","role","weak signal peptide","discovered member","IFN\u03BBs","proline","typical subset of ISGs","important evidence","significant fraction","serine","IFNs","infections","position","individuals","human population","pseudogene","P70S","impairment","unknown molecular determinant","coronaviruses","ability","feature of primates","processing"],"language":"en"},

In this study, a recombinant M protein-based indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PDCoV-rM ELISA) was developed and utilized to determine the prevalence of anti-PDCoV IgG in Hebei province. The PDCoV-rM ELISA showed no cross-reaction with antisera against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine rotavirus (PRV), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV) or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The diagnostic sensitivity was 90.6% and the diagnostic specificity was 93.3%. A total of 871 serum samples collected in Hebei from January 2015 to October 2016 were checked for presence of antibodies against PDCoV using the novel PDCoV-rM ELISA. Anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies were detected in 11% (96/871) of the samples and in 25% (10/40) of the investigated farms. The data suggest that PDCoV has a low seroprevalence in pig population in Hebei province, China.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Shang-xing; Fan, Jing-Hui; Opriessnig, Tanja; Di, Jing-Mei; Liu, Bao-jing; Zuo, Yu-Zhu","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f69a593a43478733790e1bc974f4fcf9f17ede3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113756.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28860101/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.08.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093417303208; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093417303208","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hebei","China"],"keyphrases":["anti-PDCoV antibodies","Anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies","novel PDCoV-rM ELISA","prevalence of anti-PDCoV IgG","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","porcine rotavirus","porcine circovirus","Abstract Porcine deltacoronavirus","Hebei province","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","respiratory syndrome virus","presence of antibodies","classical swine fever virus","genus Deltacoronavirus","serum samples","diagnostic sensitivity","diagnostic specificity","TGEV","CSFV","antisera","PEDV","cross-reaction","indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","pig population","PCV2","low seroprevalence","protein","dehydration","PRV","enteric disease","certain laboratories","mortality","PRRSV","China","Serological assays","neonatal piglets","geographic regions","study","total","data","investigated farms"],"language":"en"},

Incidence and characteristics of OM complicating URI by specific viruses have not been well studied. METHODS: We performed a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study of 294 healthy children (6 mos. to 3 yrs. of age). Each child was followed for 1 year for the occurrences of URI and acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) complicating URI by specific viruses. RESULTS: There were 1295 URI episodes (5.06 episodes/child-year) and 440 AOM episodes (1.72 episodes/child-year) documented. Virus studies were performed in 864 URI episodes; 63% were virus positive. Rhinovirus and adenovirus were most commonly detected during URI. The overall incidence of OM complicating URI was 61%, including 37% AOM and 24% OME. Young age was the most important predictor for AOM complicating URI. AOM occurred in about half of children with URI associated with adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and coronavirus, and about one-third of those with influenza, parainfluenza, enterovirus and rhinovirus. CONCLUSIONS: More than 60% of symptomatic URI episodes in young children were complicated by AOM and/or OME. Young age and specific virus types were predictors of AOM complicating URI. Preventive strategy for OM should be through preventing viral URI in young children. The strategy may be more effective if the priority is given to development of ways to prevent URI associated with adenovirus and RSV.","publish_time":"2008-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chonmaitree, Tasnee; Revai, Krystal; Grady, James J.; Clos, Audra; Patel, Janak A.; Nair, Sangeeta; Fan, Jiang; Henrickson, Kelly J.","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcf6cf371a350038df834f05c6d7486c802ccb60.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2744371.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1086/528685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279042/; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/46/6/815/996061/46-6-815.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OM","URI","AOM","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["occurrences of URI","viral URI","symptomatic URI episodes","AOM episodes","characteristics of OM complicating URI","overall incidence of OM complicating URI","young children","predictors of AOM","Young age","healthy children","half of children","adenovirus","child-year","OME","specific virus types","specific viruses","Virus studies","virus positive","acute otitis media","respiratory syncytial virus","RSV","Rhinovirus","RESULTS","Preventive strategy","upper respiratory infection","cohort study","important predictor","effusion","development of ways","priority","BACKGROUND","parainfluenza","enterovirus","coronavirus","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Specific LUS findings have proved useful and predictive of acute respiratory distress syndrome which is of particular relevance in the suspicion and monitoring of patients with lung disease. Furthermore, several studies have confirmed the role of LUS in the screening of interstitial lung diseases in connective tissue diseases. Given these data, LUS will likely play an important role in the management of COVID-19 patients from identification of specific abnormalities corresponding to definite pneumonia phases and CT scans findings. In addition, LUS could allow reduction in the exposure of health-care workers to potential infection.

Usually, CNS pathologies are caused by known neurotropic viruses such as measles virus (MV), herpes virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), among others. However, nowadays respiratory viruses have placed themselves as relevant agents responsible for CNS pathologies. Among these neuropathological viruses are the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), the influenza virus (IV), the coronavirus (CoV) and the human metapneumovirus (hMPV). These viral agents are leading causes of acute respiratory infections every year affecting mainly children under 5 years old and also the elderly. Up to date, several reports have described the association between respiratory viral infections with neurological symptoms. The most frequent clinical manifestations described in these patients are febrile or afebrile seizures, status epilepticus, encephalopathies and encephalitis. All these viruses have been found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which suggests that all these pathogens, once in the lungs, can spread throughout the body and eventually reach the CNS. The current knowledge about the mechanisms and routes used by these neuro-invasive viruses remains scarce. In this review article, we describe the most recent findings associated to neurologic complications, along with data about the possible invasion routes of these viruses in humans and their various effects on the CNS, as studied in animal models.","publish_time":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bohmwald, Karen; G\u00E1lvez, Nicol\u00E1s M.

A recently published international standard indicates that regions medially adjacent to the inner canthi provide accurate estimates of core body temperature and are preferred sites for fever screening. Therefore, rapid, automated identification of the canthi regions within facial IR images may greatly facilitate rapid fever screening of asymptomatic travelers. However, it is more difficult to accurately identify the canthi regions from IR images than from visible images that are rich with exploitable features. In this study, we developed and evaluated techniques for multi-modality image registration (MMIR) of simultaneously captured visible and IR facial images for fever screening. We used free form deformation (FFD) models based on edge maps to improve registration accuracy after an affine transformation. Two widely used FFD models in medical image registration based on the Demons and cubic B-spline algorithms were qualitatively compared. The results showed that the Demons algorithm outperformed the cubic B-spline algorithm, likely due to overfitting of outliers by the latter method. The quantitative measure of registration accuracy, obtained through selected control point correspondence, was within 2.8 \u00B1 1.2 mm, which enables accurate and automatic localization of canthi regions in the IR images for temperature measurement.","publish_time":"2018-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dwith Chenna, Yedukondala Narendra; Ghassemi, Pejhman; Pfefer, T.

Pre-set concentrations were used according to the volumes of the rooms and garages. Three cycles were performed with increasing contact times. Repetitive experiments were performed using Bacillus atrophaeus (formerly Bacillus subtilis) Raven 1162282 spores to control the effect of decontamination; after a sampling plan, spore strips were placed in various positions in rooms, ambulances, and inside and outside the items of medical equipment. Decontamination was effective in 87% of 146 spore tests in closed test rooms and in 100% of 48 tests in a surgical department when using three cycles. One or two cycles had no effect. The sporicidal effect on internal parts of the medical equipment was only 62.3% (220 tests). When the devices were run and ventilated during decontamination, 100% (57/57) of spore strips placed inside were decontaminated. In the ambulances, the penetration of H2O2 into equipment, devices, glove boxes, under mattresses, and the drivers\u0027 cabins was 100% (60/60 tests) when using three cycles, but was less effective when using one or two cycles. In conclusion, an H2O2 dry fumigation system, run in three cycles, seemed to have a good sporicidal effect when used in rooms, ambulances, and external and internal parts of ventilated equipment.

The deciding factor for HCW voluntary vaccination is the risk of disease exposure versus the risk of vaccine adverse events. In a United States military population, with careful screening to exclude atopic dermatitis/eczema and immunosuppression, over 1 million vaccinia (smallpox) vaccinations were delivered with one fatality attributed to vaccination. Among 37901 United States civilian volunteer HCWs vaccinated, 100 serious adverse events were reported including 10 ischemic cardiac episodes and six myocardial infarctions \u2013 two were fatal. This older population had a higher rate of adverse events due to age-related coronary artery disease. T-cell mediated inflammatory processes induced by live vaccinia vaccination may have a role in the observed acute coronary artery events. With exclusion of individuals at risk for coronary artery disease, atopic dermatitis/eczema, and immunosuppression, HCWs can be smallpox vaccinated with minimal risk.

We found that influenza A and B viruses co-dominated in the season. Among the influenza A viruses, A/H1N1/ pdm09 subtype was a more frequent source of infection than A/H3N2/ subtype. In addition, the prevalence of infection was re-analyzed in children stratified into the age groups of 0\u20134, 5\u20139, and 10\u201314 years old. We found a relation between the age of a child and the type of influenza virus causing infection. The youngest children under 4 years were the most vulnerable to both influenza and influenza-like infections; the former caused mostly by influenza A and the latter by RSV.

The transgenic mice were infected with Candida albicans intravenously to study how DC-SIGN expression affected the pathogenesis of systemic candidiasis. We discovered that, while C. albicans infection induced renal fibrosis in both transgenic and littermate control mice, the transgenic mice had significantly lower levels of Acta2, Col1a2, Col3a1, and Col4a1 mRNA transcripts compared to the controls. KIM-1, an emerging biomarker for kidney injury, along with Tnf, Il6, and Tgfb1 transcripts, were lower in infected transgenic mice, and yet, the levels of Il10 remained comparable to the controls. While renal CD45(\u002B) infiltrating cells were the source of Tnf, Il6, and Il10, LTL(\u002B) renal proximal tubular epithelial cells were TGF-\u03B21 producers in both infected transgenic and littermate controls. DC-SIGN-expressing tubular epithelial cells produced less TGF-\u03B21 in response to C. albicans infection. In vivo experiments demonstrated that renal proximal tubular epithelial cell production of TGF-\u03B21 was key to C. albicans-induced renal fibrosis and injury. Infection of transgenic mice induced a marked increase of phosphorylated Raf-1 and p38 in the kidney. However, ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation was more pronounced in the infected-littermate controls. Interestingly, treating the infected transgenic mice with a Raf-1 inhibitor increased the levels of the Tgfb1, Kim1, and Acta2 transcripts. These results indicate that DC-SIGN signaling, through activation of Raf-1 and p38 and suppression of JNK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, reduces TGF-\u03B21 production and C. albicans-induced renal fibrosis.

Previous studies by our group and others have demonstrated that porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection could activate NF-\u03BAB in MARC-145 cells and alveolar macrophages. The nucleocapsid (N) protein was identified as an NF-\u03BAB activator among the structural proteins encoded by PRRSV; however, it remains unclear whether the nonstructural proteins (Nsps) contribute to NF-\u03BAB activation. In this study, we identified which Nsps can activate NF-\u03BAB and investigated the potential mechanism(s) by which they act. RESULTS: By screening the individual Nsps of PRRSV strain WUH3, Nsp2 exhibited great potential to activate NF-\u03BAB in MARC-145 and HeLa cells. Overexpression of Nsp2 induced I\u03BAB\u03B1 degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03BAB. Furthermore, Nsp2 also induced NF-\u03BAB-dependent inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, COX-2, and RANTES. Compared with the Nsp2 of the classical PRRSV strain, the Nsp2 of highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strains that possess a 30 amino acid (aa) deletion in Nsp2 displayed greater NF-\u03BAB activation. However, the 30-aa deletion was demonstrated to not be associated with NF-\u03BAB activation. Further functional domain analyses revealed that the hypervariable region (HV) of Nsp2 was essential for NF-\u03BAB activation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that PRRSV Nsp2 is a multifunctional protein participating in the modulation of host inflammatory response, which suggests an important role of Nsp2 in pathogenesis and disease outcomes.","publish_time":"2012-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Ying; Fang, Liurong; Wang, Yang; Lei, Yingying; Luo, Rui; Wang, Dang; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0f496f49f4b2dea73cf8c184ff21275bf706908.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3443020.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22546080/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-83","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV Nsp2","NF-\u03BAB activator","greater NF-\u03BAB activation","nuclear translocation of NF","important role of Nsp2","HP-PRRSV","pathogenic PRRSV","classical PRRSV strain","Overexpression of Nsp2 induced I\u03BAB\u03B1 degradation","individual Nsps of PRRSV strain WUH3","MARC","aa deletion","IL","Nuclear factor-kappaB","key role","great potential","potential mechanism","multifunctional protein","nonstructural proteins","HeLa cells","dependent inflammatory factors","inducible transcription factor","modulation of host inflammatory response","respiratory syndrome virus","infection","hypervariable region","pathogenesis","strains","amino acid","inflammation","immune responses","interleukin","HV","functional domain analyses","disease outcomes","regulation of cell proliferation","survival","group","alveolar macrophages","BACKGROUND","data","Previous studies","COX","nucleocapsid","RESULTS","RANTES","CONCLUSIONS","study"],"language":"en"},

After overcoming the onslaught of SARS, the Hong Kong community has become aware that emerging infections can occur at any time. This is reinforced by the recent avian influenza outbreaks, which act as a reminder of this looming threat. Hospitals have to evaluate their levels of preparedness against bioterrorism, which can simulate infectious disease outbreaks. The priority areas for improvement include community involvement, staff education, improved information technology, disease surveillance, and additional equipment and staff. Multidimensional and flexible-response plans require strong leadership and clear directions to be effective, and such plans must also consider human frailties during great stress, when every resource is stretched to its utmost limit. The chapter concludes by discussing the various infection-control measures implemented in Hong Kong.","publish_time":"2006-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Arthur Chun-Wing; Yam, Loretta Yin-Chun; Yip, Ida Kam-Siu; Li, Man-Ching; Sit, Alfred Wing-Hang; Wan, Mary; Lee, Rodney Allan; Yung, Raymond Wai-Hung","journal":"Hospital Preparation for Bioterror","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d308690b94821056311b8fe89edc85245a3afe13.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780120884407500252; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780120884407500252","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["Hong Kong community","Hong Kong acute-care hospital","chapter","flexible-response plans","infectious disease outbreaks","community involvement","staff education","disease surveillance","onslaught of SARS","acts of bioterrorism","severe acute respiratory syndrome","recent avian influenza outbreaks","improved information technology","strong leadership","improvement","clear directions","setting","various infection-control measures","emerging infections","additional equipment","resource","great stress","human frailties","priority areas","Publisher Summary","levels of preparedness","utmost limit","time","reminder","prototype","threat","Hospitals"],"language":"en"},

Design and methods The time of immersion and extraction and the ratios (material/solvent) of the combination of YPS and FSI were optimized on the basis of polysaccharide and flavonoid yields via orthogonal design. The optimal result was used in the 1,1-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and animal experiments to test the antioxidant activity, which is reflected by superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity serum levels. The optimal extraction process was determined using various ingredients to obtain complex extracts with high active ingredient content and antioxidant activity. DPPH assay results showed that the optimized ingredients have antioxidant effects, and the combination had better antioxidation function than YPS in vitro. The combination also showed synergistic antioxidant activity compared with YPS in vivo. Conclusions The combination of YPS and FSI had a synergistic antioxidant effect in vitro.

OBJECTIVES: We describe EV and PeV infections among children from 2 US study sites aged \u003C1 year and hospitalized with acute infections. For EV- and PeV-negative case-patients, we explored other viral etiologies. METHODS: Participants were aged \u003C1 year, hospitalized during 2016, and had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected for routine diagnostic testing. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical charts, and residual specimens were sent to CDC for confirmatory testing and typing. RESULTS: Of 472 eligible case-patients, CSF specimen was available for 319 (67.6%). Among those, 13 (4.1%) were positive for EV and 11 (3.4%) for PeV. Most case-patients (86.8%, n = 277) were aged \u003C2 months, as were all EV- or PeV-positive case-patients. None of the positive case-patients had underlying conditions, and the chief complaint for 91.7% (n = 22) was fever. Twelve positive case-patients were admitted to intensive care (ICU) and had brief hospital stays (median 2 days). Sequencing revealed a variety of EV types and the predominance of PeV-A3 among the PeV-positive case-patients. CONCLUSIONS: A range of EV and PeV types were associated with acute febrile illnesses leading to hospitalization in children aged \u003C2 months. Approximately half of EV and PeV case-patients were admitted to ICU, but length of hospital stay was brief and illnesses were generally self-limiting. Clinicians should consider EV and PeV infections in infants presenting with febrile illness.","publish_time":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abedi, Glen R.; Messacar, Kevin; Luong, William; Nix, W.

Further, we found that well-controlled BG (glycemic variability within 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) was associated with markedly lower mortality compared to individuals with poorly controlled BG (upper limit of glycemic variability exceeding 10.0 mmol/L) (adjusted HR, 0.14) during hospitalization.

Studies conducted during the last 20 years identified a total of 35 species of endoparasites, five ectoparasites, six bacterial or protozoan species, and five viruses found in the subspecies Nyctereutes procyonoides ussuriensis in its original and newly occupied habitat or in Nyctereutes procyonoides koreensis in its original habitat, respectively. With reference to raccoon dogs impact as vector species and the relevance for human and animal health, we selected Trichinella spp., Echinococcus multilocularis, Francisella tularensis, rabies virus, and canine distemper virus for detailed description. Results of studies from Finland and Germany furthermore showed that biological characteristics of the raccoon dog make this carnivore an ideal host and vector for a variety of pathogens. This may result in a growing importance of this invasive species concerning the epidemiology of some transmissible diseases in Europe, including the hazard that the existence of autochthonous wildlife, particularly small populations, is endangered. Potential adverse effects on human and animal health in the livestock sector must also be taken into account.

This is a zoonotic infection, similar to other coronavirus infections, that is believed to have originated in bats and pangolins and later transmitted to humans. Once in the human body, this coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is abundantly present in nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions of affected patients, and its spread is predominantly thought to be respiratory droplet/contact in nature. Dental professionals, including endodontists, may encounter patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and will have to act diligently not only to provide care but at the same time prevent nosocomial spread of infection. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, symptoms, and routes of transmission of this novel infection.

Two hundred and thirty-six clinical specimens were tested by comparing with single real-time RT-PCR and result from the duplex assay was 100% consistent with the results of single real-time RT-PCR and sequence analysis.","publish_time":"2010-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, Xiao-ping; Jiang, Tao; Li, Yong-qiang; Lin, Fang; Liu, Hong; Chang, Guo-hui; Zhu, Qing-yu; Qin, E-de; Qin, Cheng-feng; Yang, Yin-hui","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63c9d5537c05b45dde4b7584c66a95e839b582ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2892456.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20515509/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-113","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["duplex real-time RT-PCR assay","results of single real-time RT-PCR","single-target RT-PCR","duplex assay","pandemic H1N1","subtype influenza viruses","pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus","early diagnosis of influenza","TCID","duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","respiratory tract viruses","simultaneous detection","patients","tissue culture infective dose","sequence analysis","cross reactivity","primers","sensitivity","epidemiological surveillance","probes","clinical specimens"],"language":"en"},

We estimated the disease burden and impact of birth-related, maternal, household, and seasonal factors on HCoV infections among children from birth to 6 months old in rural Nepal. METHODS: Prospective, active, weekly surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was conducted in infants over a period of 3 years during 2 consecutive, population-based randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization. Midnasal swabs were collected for acute respiratory symptoms and tested for HCoV and other viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Association between HCoV incidence and potential risk factors was modeled using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Overall, 282 of 3505 (8%) infants experienced an HCoV ARI within the first 6 months of life. HCoV incidence overall was 255.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 227.3\u2013286.5) per 1000 person-years, and was more than twice as high among nonneonates than among neonates (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.53; 95% CI, 1.52\u20134.21). HCoV ARI incidence was also positively associated with the number of children \u003C5 years of age per room in a household (IRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01\u20131.28). Of the 296 HCoV infections detected, 46% were coinfections with other respiratory viruses. While HCoVs were detected throughout the study period, seasonal variation was also observed, with incidence peaking in 2 winters (December\u2013February) and 1 autumn (September\u2013November). CONCLUSIONS: HCoV is associated with a substantial proportion of illnesses among young infants in rural Nepal. There is an increased risk of HCoV infection beyond the first month of life.","publish_time":"2018-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uddin, S M Iftekhar; Englund, Janet A; Kuypers, Jane Y; Chu, Helen Y; Steinhoff, Mark C; Khatry, Subarna K; LeClerq, Steve C; Tielsch, James M; Mullany, Luke C; Shrestha, Laxman; Katz, Joanne","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95648e7d8513a790e6e07df43a7ffac9bf882db5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6206108.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668900/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCoV incidence","HCoV infections","HCoV ARI incidence","increased risk of HCoV infection","acute respiratory infections","incidence peaking","seasonal factors","respiratory viruses","potential risk factors","Knowledge of risk factors","incidence rate ratio","acute respiratory symptoms","household","young infants","number of children","rural Nepal","IRR","years of age","months of life","person-years","impact of birth","months old","seasonal variation","study period","month of life","randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization","weekly surveillance","symptomatic human coronavirus","substantial proportion of illnesses","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","population","ARIs","nonneonates","room","Association","disease burden","Midnasal swabs","Poisson regression","community settings","METHODS","BACKGROUND","coinfections","HCoVs","confidence interval","winters","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","autumn"],"language":"en"},

Principal results The WHO and CDC definitions of \u201Cinfluenza-like illness\u201D are similar. However many studies use other definitions, some not specifying a temperature and requiring specific respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, making many samples non-comparable. Most ILI studies find less than 25% of cases are RT-PCR-positive, those which test for other viruses and bacteria usually find multiple other pathogens, and most identify no pathogen in about 50% of cases. ILI symptom and symptom combinations do not have high sensitivity or specificity in identifying PCR-positive influenza cases. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are increasingly used to screen ILI cases and they have low sensitivity and high specificity when compared to RT-PCR in identifying influenza. Main conclusions The working diagnosis of ILI presumes influenza may be involved until proven otherwise. Health care workers would benefit by renaming the WHO and CDC ILI symptoms and signs as \u201Cacute respiratory illness\u201D and also using the WHO acute severe respiratory illness definition if the illness is severe and meets this criterion. This renaming would shift attention to identify the viral and bacterial pathogens in cases and epidemics, identify new pathogens, implement vaccination plans appropriate to the identified pathogens, and estimate workload during the viral season. Randomised controlled trials testing the effectiveness of influenza vaccine require all participants to be assessed by a gold standard (RT-PCR). ILI has no role in measuring influenza vaccine effectiveness. ILI is well established in the literature and in the operational definition of many surveillance databases and its imprecise definition may be inhibiting progress in research and treatment. The current ILI definition could with benefit be renamed \u201Cacute respiratory illness,\u201D with additional definitions for \u201Csevere acute respiratory illness\u201D (SARI) with RT-PCR testing for pathogens to facilitate prevention and treatment.","publish_time":"2014-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thomas, Roger E.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb4559846cc88a70f82266bfdd80dbac2df8af93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127078.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X14002448; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14002448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582634/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.02.059","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","Rapid","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ILI cases","ILI studies","PCR-positive influenza cases","effectiveness of influenza vaccine","severe acute respiratory illness","current ILI definition","acute severe respiratory illness definition","CDC ILI symptoms","measuring influenza vaccine effectiveness","RT-PCR testing","working diagnosis of ILI","Rapid influenza diagnostic tests","new pathogens","bacterial pathogens","identified pathogens","operational definition","imprecise definition","CDC definitions","additional definitions","high sensitivity","high specificity","benefit","treatment","renaming","systemic symptoms","low sensitivity","symptom combinations","viral season","SARI","signs","surveillance databases","vaccination","epidemics","role","Main conclusions","progress","workload","Randomised controlled trials","utility","participants","prevention","samples non-comparable","gold standard","attention","Principal results","research","temperature","literature","Health care workers","viruses","Abstract Purpose","criterion"],"language":"en"},

Since its emergence, CPV-2 has been replaced with new genetic variants (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c). Currently, information about the genotype prevalence of CPV-2 in Vietnam is limited. In the present study, we investigated the genotype prevalence and distribution of CPV-2 in the three regions of Vietnam. METHODS: Rectal swabs were collected from 260 dogs with suspected CPV-2 infection from northern, central, and southern Vietnam from November 2016 to February 2018. All samples were identified as parvovirus positive by real-time PCR, and further genotyping was performed using a SimpleProbe\u00AE real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of the 260 Vietnamese CPV-2 isolates, 6 isolates (2.31%) were identified as CPV-2a, 251 isolates (96.54%) were identified as CPV-2c and 3 isolates (1.15%) were untypable using the SimpleProbe\u00AE real-time PCR assay. In northern Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 2.97% (3/101) and 97.3% (98/101), respectively. In central Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 1.11% (1/90) and 98.89% (89/90), respectively. In southern Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 3.03% (2/66) and 96.97% (64/66), respectively. CPV-2b was not observed in this study. The VP2 genes of CPV-2c in Vietnam are more genetically similar to those of CPV-2c strains in China and Taiwan than to those of prototype CPV-2c strains (FJ222821) or the first Vietnamese CPV-2c (AB120727). CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that CPV-2c is the most prevalent variant in Vietnam. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the recent Vietnamese CPV-2c isolates share a common evolutionary origin with Asian CPV-2c strains.

The genetic similarity of the isolates was investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Most of the isolates from four dogs housed at a re-homing kennel were genetically similar and some isolates from different dogs were indistinguishable by both PFGE and RAPD. These isolates were cultured from dogs with non-overlapping stays in the kennel, which may indicate maintenance of some strains within kennels. A small number of isolates showed much greater genetic heterogeneity and were genetically distinct from the main group of M. cynos strains.

The prospective Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases birth cohort study intensively evaluated the community\u2010based epidemiology of respiratory viruses and bacteria during the first 2\u2010years of life. Here we report the bacteriologic findings. METHODS: Pregnant women in Brisbane, Australia were recruited between September 2010 and October 2012, and their healthy newborn children were followed for the first 2\u2010years of life. Parents kept a daily symptom diary for the study child, collected a weekly anterior nose swab and completed an illness burden diary when their child met pre\u2010defined illness criteria. Specimens were tested for respiratory bacteria by real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and those containing human genomic DNA, deemed as high\u2010quality, were analyzed. RESULTS: Altogether 8100 high\u2010quality nasal swab specimens from 158 enrolled children were analyzed. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae were detected in 42.4%, 38.9%, and 14.8% of these samples, respectively. Concomitant detection of bacteria was common. In contrast, Bordetella pertussis, B. parapertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Simkania negevensis were rarely identified. The prevalence of the three major bacteria was higher with increasing age and in the winter and spring months. Siblings and childcare attendance were the other risk factors identified. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the feasibility of frequent nasal swabbing by parents for studying bacterial colonization. PCR detected the major respiratory tract bacteria with expected high frequencies, but atypical bacteria were found rarely in this cohort.","publish_time":"2019-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palmu, Arto A.; Ware, Robert S.; Lambert, Stephen B.; Sarna, Mohinder; Bialasiewicz, Seweryn; Seib, Kate L.; Atack, John M.; Nissen, Michael D.; Grimwood, Keith","journal":"Pediatr Pulmonol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f30b60d6d87ae04dfd5fe469f3f496080c924cbd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167656.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30609299/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.24231","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bordetella"],"organizations":["Observational Research","PCR"],"locations":["Brisbane","Australia"],"keyphrases":["major bacteria","atypical bacteria","major respiratory tract bacteria","Concomitant detection of bacteria","respiratory bacterial carriage studies","study child","Chlamydia pneumoniae","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","PCR","based epidemiology of respiratory viruses","Streptococcus pneumoniae","high\u2010quality nasal swab specimens","Parents","enrolled children","years of life","illness burden diary","healthy newborn children","longitudinal studies","cross\u2010sectional samples","bacterial colonization","Childhood Infectious Diseases birth cohort study","daily symptom diary","weekly anterior nose swab","feasibility of frequent nasal swabbing","pre\u2010defined illness criteria","expected high frequencies","assays","parapertussis","community","real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction","prospective Observational Research","increasing age","Moraxella catarrhalis","infrequent sampling points","Bordetella pertussis","human genomic DNA","childcare attendance","Pregnant women","Brisbane","winter","BACKGROUND","Haemophilus influenzae","Simkania negevensis","risk factors","METHODS","Australia","contrast","RESULTS","spring months","Siblings","prevalence","bacteriologic findings","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, the development of chimeric and humanized mAbs is important for therapeutic purpose. This is facilitated by a variety of molecular techniques like recombinant DNA technology and the better understanding of the structure and function of antibody. The human-mouse chimeric forms allow detailed analysis of the mechanism of inhibition and the potential for therapeutic applications.

The HIV frameshift site consists of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence (UUUUUUA) followed by a spacer region and a downstream RNA stem\u2013loop structure. Here we investigate the role of the RNA structure in promoting the \u22121 frameshift. The stem\u2013loop was systematically altered to decouple the contributions of local and overall thermodynamic stability towards frameshift efficiency. No correlation between overall stability and frameshift efficiency is observed. In contrast, there is a strong correlation between frameshift efficiency and the local thermodynamic stability of the first 3\u20134 bp in the stem\u2013loop, which are predicted to reside at the opening of the mRNA entrance channel when the ribosome is paused at the slippery site. Insertion or deletions in the spacer region appear to correspondingly change the identity of the base pairs encountered 8 nt downstream of the slippery site. Finally, the role of the surrounding genomic secondary structure was investigated and found to have a modest impact on frameshift efficiency, consistent with the hypothesis that the genomic secondary structure attenuates frameshifting by affecting the overall rate of translation.","publish_time":"2012-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mouzakis, Kathryn D.; Lang, Andrew L.; Vander Meulen, Kirk A.; Easterday, Preston D.; Butcher, Samuel E.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2ad458ccf62686e340e51ea95c439e7c4e2bc29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3561942.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23248007/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gks1254","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frameshift efficiency","ribosomal frameshift","HIV frameshift site","loop structure","RNA structure","overall stability","slippery site","local thermodynamic stability","downstream RNA stem","surrounding genomic secondary structure","spacer region","role","heptanucleotide slippery sequence","overall rate of translation","strong correlation","contributions of local","hypothesis","ribosome","UUUUUUA","frameshifting","Pol gene expression","mRNA entrance channel","modest impact","human immunodeficiency virus","base pairs","opening","identity","Insertion","deletions","contrast","bp"],"language":"en"},

For this faeces and/or ascites samples from 19 cats suffering from feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) as well as from 20 FECV-infected healthy cats were used. Sequence comparisons revealed that 3c genes of animals with FIP were heavily affected by nucleotide deletions and point mutations compared to animals infected with FECV; these alterations resulted either in early termination or destruction of the translation initiation codon. Two ascites-derived samples of cats with FIP which displayed no alterations of ORF3c harboured mutations in the S2 domain of the S protein gene which resulted in amino acid exchanges or deletions. Moreover, changes in 3c were often accompanied by mutations in S2. In contrast, in samples obtained from faeces of healthy cats, the ORF3c was never affected by such mutations. Similarly ORF3c from faecal samples of the cats with FIP was mostly intact and showed only in a few cases the same mutations found in the respective ascites samples. The genes encoding 3a, 3b, 7a and 7b displayed no mutations linked to the feline coronavirus (FCoV) biotype. The M protein gene was found to be conserved between FECV and FIPV samples.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 3541 households in China in 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Households were selected using a stratified cluster sampling strategy, representing central, eastern, western and southern regions of China. The designed questionnaires were administered through face-to-face interviews. OUTCOME MEASURES: Household emergency preparedness was measured with 14 indicators, tapping into the supply of nine emergency necessities (food and water, extra batteries, battery-powered radio, battery-operated torch, first-aid kit, gas mask, fire extinguisher, escape ropes, whistle), coverage of accident insurance, knowledge of local emergency response systems (emergency numbers, exit routes and shelters) and availability of a household evacuation plan. If an individual acted on 9 of the 14 indicators, they were deemed well prepared. Logistic regression models were established to identify predictors of well preparedness based on 3541 returned questionnaires containing no missing values. RESULTS: Only 9.9% of households were well prepared for emergencies: 53.6% did not know what to do and 31.6% did not want to think about it. A higher level of preparedness was found in the respondents who have attained higher education (adjusted OR=0.826 compared with the higher level), participated in emergency training activities (adjusted OR=2.299), had better emergency knowledge (adjusted OR=2.043), reported less fate-submissiveness (adjusted OR=1.385) and more self-reliance (adjusted OR=1.349), prior exposure to emergency events (adjusted OR=1.280) and held more positive attitudes towards preparedness (adjusted OR=1.286). CONCLUSION: Household preparedness for emergency events is poor in China. Lack of motivation, negative attitude to preparedness and knowledge shortfall are major but remediable barriers for household preparedness.","publish_time":"2019-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Chao Yi; Xu, Wei; Dai, Yajun; Xu, Weilan; Liu, Chaojie; Wu, Qunhong; Gao, Lijun; Kang, Zheng; Hao, Yanhua; Ning, Ning","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0e4a23b392c97a4cce74b1da7bffffa6eee36ed.json; document_parses/pdf_json/84ef152ba76ced39a6ab7f082895541c1b3ea9ec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f2948dc01fd28774bb06b6c6995bec2a2f466f2a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6887017.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-032462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31727663/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Household emergency preparedness","household preparedness","emergency events","emergency numbers","emergency necessities","better emergency knowledge","higher level of preparedness","emergency training activities","knowledge of local emergency response systems","households","household evacuation plan","knowledge shortfall","southern regions of China","higher education","indicators","returned questionnaires","designed questionnaires","extra batteries","battery-powered radio","battery-operated torch","food","water","coverage of accident insurance","negative attitude","remediable barriers","aid kit","extinguisher","whistle","stratified cluster sampling strategy","availability","routes","shelters","gas mask","ropes","supply","OUTCOME MEASURES","cross-sectional questionnaire survey","determinants","CONCLUSION","Lack of motivation","face-to-face interviews","missing values","predictors","respondents","prior exposure","study","Logistic regression models","positive attitudes","emergencies","fate-submissiveness","OBJECTIVE","PARTICIPANTS","RESULTS","individual","self-reliance"],"language":"en"},

Only after the emergence in 2002 of SARS in human has new attention been focused on coronaviruses. As a consequence of the relatively high mutation frequency of RNA-positive stranded viruses, CCoV has evolved and, with the biomolecular techniques developed over the last two decades, new virus strains, serotypes, and subtypes have been identified in infected dogs. Considering the widespread nature of CCoV infections among dog populations, several studies have been carried out, focusing upon the epidemiological relevance of these viruses and underlining the need for further investigation into the biology of CCoVs and into the pathogenetic role of the infections. This paper reports the evolutionary processes of CCoVs with a note onto recent diagnostic methods.","publish_time":"2011-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pratelli, Annamaria","journal":"Adv Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/551042ee7c8e1bd9f237a51c666376205c89bb3e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3265307.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/562831; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22315601/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new virus strains","widespread nature of CCoV infections","biology of CCoVs","new attention","canine coronavirus","pathogenetic role","positive stranded viruses","evolutionary processes of CCoVs","canine enteric illness","high mutation frequency of RNA","note","dog populations","subtypes","decades","serotypes","SARS","human","disease","recent diagnostic methods","consequence","need","investigation","paper","studies","infected dogs","emergence","epidemiological relevance","coronaviruses","biomolecular techniques","identification"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to determine and compare the frequency distribution of the various infectious etiologies for these diseases. One hundred seventy five adults in the community with febrile LRTI and 75 with febrile URTI were included in a purely serologically based prospective study. Paired sera were obtained for each of the patients and were tested by EIA or immunofluorescence methods to identify 14 different pathogens. Only a significant change in antibody titers between the paired sera was considered diagnostic. At least one infectious etiology was identified in 167 patients (67%). In the LRTI group, infection with at least one of 7 respiratory viruses was found in 88 patients (50%). One of the atypical pathogens was found in 40 patients (23%), of these Legionella spp. in 19 (11%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 18 (10%). A bacterial etiology was found in 19 patients (11%), of these Streptococcus pneumoniae in 8 (5%) and \u03B2-hemolytic streptococci group A in 5 (3%). The frequency distribution of etiologies in the URTI group was not significantly different from the LRTI group, except for M. pneumoniae that was identified in only one patient with URTI (p = 0.015). More than one etiologic agent was found in 42 (17%) of the patients. LRTI is caused by a broad spectrum of etiologies, with respiratory viruses predominating and a moderate, but significant, prevalence of atypical pathogens. The frequency distribution of etiologies for URTI is similar to LRTI. In a significant proportion of patients with URTI and LRTI there is serologic evidence of infection with more than one pathogen. The justification and benefit of distinguishing between URTI and LRTI in routine clinical work is doubtful. When a decision is reached to treat RTI patients with an antibiotic, it is logical to use a macrolide or tetracycline.","publish_time":"2002-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lieberman, David; Lieberman, Devora; Korsonsky, Igor; Ben-Yaakov, Miriam; Lazarovich, Zilia; Friedman, Maureen G.; Dvoskin, Bella; Leinonen, Maija; Ohana, Bella; Boldur, Ida","journal":"Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3f82089b3547cc954ffe4d32ea1094364e136fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7134668.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889301003248; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889301003248","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["EIA","URTI","LRTI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["URTI group","LRTI group","febrile URTI","febrile LRTI","RTI patients","significant proportion of patients","frequency distribution of etiologies","respiratory viruses","upper respiratory tract infection","different pathogens","infectious etiology","Abstract Lower respiratory tract infection","various infectious etiologies","serologic evidence of infection","broad spectrum of etiologies","significant change","Paired sera","prevalence of atypical pathogens","bacterial etiology","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","\u03B2-hemolytic streptococci group","routine practice","prospective study","routine clinical work","antibody titers","benefit of distinguishing","immunofluorescence methods","antibiotic","justification","EIA","diseases","adults","community","macrolide","tetracycline","decision","etiologic agent","objective","Legionella"],"language":"en"},

The spike glycoprotein of IBV is essential for host cell attachment, neutralization, and is involved in the induction of protective immunity. Previously obtained sequence data of the spike gene of IBV QX-like and Massachusetts strains were subjected to bioinformatics analysis. FINDINGS: On analysis of potential phosphorylation sites, the Ser542 and Ser563 sites were not present in Massachusetts strains, while QX-like isolates did not have the Ser534 site. Massachusetts and QX-like strains showed different cleavage site motifs. The N-glycosylation sites ASN-XAA-SER/THR-55, 147, 200 and 545 were additionally present in QX-like strains. The leucine-rich repeat regions in Massachusetts strains consisted of stretches of 63 to 69 amino acids, while in the QX-like strains they contained 59 amino acids in length. An additional palmitoylation site was observed in CK/SWE/082066/2010 a QX-like strain. Primary structure data showed difference in the physical properties and hydrophobic nature of both genotypes. The comparison of secondary structures revealed no new structural domains in the genotypic variants. The phylogenetic analyses based on avian and mammalian coronaviruses showed the analysed IBV as closely related to turkey coronaviruses and distantly related to thrush and munia coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that spike glycoprotein of the Massachusetts and the QX-like variants of IBV are molecularly distinct and that this may reflect in differences in the behavior of these viruses in vivo.","publish_time":"2012-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abro, Shahid Hussain; Ullman, Karin; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Baule, Claudia","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f28ddf08dc9bb5b9b4c291f15d3d42ecdf9cde4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3502414.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22992336/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Massachusetts"],"keyphrases":["Massachusetts strains","spike gene of IBV QX","variants of IBV","spike glycoprotein of IBV","analysed IBV","Ser563 sites","mammalian coronaviruses","turkey coronaviruses","Ser534 site","munia coronaviruses","amino acids","analysis of potential phosphorylation sites","additional palmitoylation site","genotypic variants","different cleavage site motifs","bioinformatics analysis","N-glycosylation sites ASN-XAA","obtained sequence data","Primary structure data","new structural domains","physical properties","host cell attachment","causative agent","Ser542","leucine-rich repeat regions","hydrophobic nature","comparison of secondary structures","Infectious bronchitis virus","important disease","family Coronaviridae","neutralization","Gammacoronavirus","BACKGROUND","thrush","isolates","phylogenetic analyses","genotypes","FINDINGS","study","SWE","differences","behavior","induction of protective immunity","poultry","CONCLUSION","length"],"language":"en"},

An analysis of virus-specific CD8\u002B T-cell immunity in 30 survivors showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8\u002B response to at least one EBOV protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire. We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6 mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8\u002B T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually sound and feasible.

This model system was used to investigate delivery of the internal structural proteins of PVM as a potential vaccination strategy to protect against pneumovirus disease. Replication-deficient recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vectors were constructed that expressed the M or N gene of PVM pathogenic strain J3666. Intranasal delivery of these rAd5 vectors gave protection against a lethal challenge dose of PVM in three different mouse strains, and protection lasted for at least 20 weeks post-immunisation. Whilst the PVM-specific antibody response in such animals was weak and inconsistent, rAd5N primed a strong PVM-specific CD8\u002B T cell response and, to a lesser extent, a CD4\u002B T cell response. These findings suggest that T-cell responses may be more important than serum IgG in the observed protection induced by rAd5N.","publish_time":"2015-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maunder, Helen E.; Taylor, Geraldine; Leppard, Keith N.; Easton, Andrew J.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20c07c7643df372f94eddb5df00d4d653cc421c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125973.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26529077/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X15015613; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.10.105; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15015613","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PVM-specific antibody response","T cell response","strong PVM-specific CD8","lethal challenge dose of PVM","T-cell responses","internal structural proteins of PVM","observed protection","rAd5 vectors","rAd5N","N gene of PVM pathogenic strain J3666","Abstract Pneumonia virus of mice","human respiratory syncytial virus infection","infection of BALB","c mice","pneumovirus disease","fatal pneumonia","Intranasal delivery","recognised model","model system","development of severe disease","dose-dependent manner","Replication-deficient recombinant human adenovirus serotype","animals","potential vaccination strategy","bronchiolitis","different mouse strains","lesser extent","CD4","serum IgG","findings","weeks post-immunisation","pathogenesis of pneumoviruses"],"language":"en"},

The investigations were performed in coordination with academic partners, health care providers, and homeless service providers. Investigations included reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing at commercial and public health laboratories for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, over approximately 1-2 weeks for residents and staff members at the five shelters. During the same period, the team in Seattle, Washington, also tested residents and staff members at 12 shelters where a single case in each had been identified. In Atlanta, Georgia, a team proactively tested residents and staff members at two shelters with no known COVID-19 cases in the preceding 2 weeks. In each city, the objective was to test all shelter residents and staff members at each assessed facility, irrespective of symptoms. Persons who tested positive were transported to hospitals or predesignated community isolation areas.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mosites, Emily; Parker, Erin M; Clarke, Kristie E N; Gaeta, Jessie M; Baggett, Travis P; Imbert, Elizabeth; Sankaran, Madeline; Scarborough, Ashley; Huster, Karin; Hanson, Matt; Gonzales, Elysia; Rauch, Jody; Page, Libby; McMichael, Temet M; Keating, Ryan; Marx, Grace E; Andrews, Tom; Schmit, Kristine; Morris, Sapna Bamrah; Dowling, Nicole F; Peacock, Georgina","journal":"MMWR.

Due to movement of people from one city to other cities, one country to other countries, infection spreads and COVID-19 became a pandemic. Efforts were made at local, regional and national levels to lockdown the movement of people and to keep infected one in quarantine or isolation to stop the spread of COVID-19. The traffic, market and small industries were closed, as a result pronounced decline in the concentrations of particulate matters (PM) were observed. Normally these sources contribute to the high concentrations of particulate matters (PM2.5) which represents air quality of a location. In this short communication, we present analysis of PM2.5 of major cities (New York, Los Angeles, Zaragoza, Rome, Dubai, Delhi, Mumbai, Beijing and Shanghai) around the world suffered severely with the COVID-19. Our analysis shows decline in PM2.5 concentration due to lockdown, mainly due to less movement of people to keep \u201Csocial distancing\u201D to control the spread of CORONA-19. The low concentrations of PM2.5 reflect the efforts made in the cities to curb the spread of infection, that improve air quality.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chauhan, Akshansha; Singh, Ramesh P.","journal":"Environ Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7addafbdc60009f2b9f8cd9c3d34fb04cdf4f58a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199701.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120305272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32416359/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305272?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109634","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Zaragoza","Rome","Dubai","Delhi","Mumbai","Beijing","Shanghai"],"keyphrases":["spread of COVID","movement of people","spread of infection","low concentrations of PM2","spread of CORONA","present analysis of PM2","major cities","high concentrations of particulate matters","lockdown","air quality","Efforts","infection spreads","Wuhan city","result pronounced decline","Zaragoza","Los Angeles","Delhi","Dubai","Rome","New York","national levels","Beijing","Mumbai","country","countries","Shanghai","isolation","small industries","short communication","social distancing","traffic","market","China","world","quarantine","sources","location","globe","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

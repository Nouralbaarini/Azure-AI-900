Experiment 1 used 360 pigs fed 1 of 6 experimental diets from d 0 to 15, followed by a common diet fed to all pigs from d 15 to 28 post-weaning with 11 pens of 5 or 6 pigs/pen allotted per treatment. Experimental diets were based on 8.04% soy protein concentrate (SPC) as the control protein or a similar diet with either 2.50 or 5.00% SDPP or 0.17, 0.33, or 1.00% activated porcine plasma (APP) replacing SPC on an equal Lys basis. Experiment 2 used 300 pigs that were fed 1 of 6 experimental diets from d 0 to 14 post-weaning with 10 pens of 4 to 6 pigs/pen allotted per diet. Experiment 2 diets were based on 8.04% SPC as the control protein source or similar diets with the following specialty proteins replacing SPC on an equal Lys basis: 0.40% APP; 10.66% enzymatically hydrolyzed soy and yeast protein (EHSY); a combination (CB) of 6.36% EHSY, 0.40% APP, and 2.50% fish meal; 0.44% spray-dried whole egg from hyper-immunized hens (IEGG); or 5.00% SDBP. Results of Exp. 1 indicated pigs fed SDPP diets had greater (P \u003C 0.05) ADG and ADFI at d 7 and 15 compared with pigs fed SPC or APP diets. Gain:feed at d 7 was higher (P \u003C 0.05) for pigs fed diets with SDPP compared with other diets. Average BW at d 7 was greater (P \u003C 0.05) for pigs fed diets with SDPP compared to other diets and pigs fed the 5.00% SDPP diet had greater BW at d 15 compared to diets without SDPP. At d 28 BW was greater (P \u003C 0.05) for pigs fed the 2.50% SDPP diet compared with pigs fed diets with SPC, 0.33% APP, or 1.00% APP. Performance of pigs fed the SPC diet did not differ from APP diets at any period of the study. In Exp. 2, pigs fed the SDBP diet had greater (P \u003C 0.05) BW, ADG, and ADFI at d 7 and 14 compared with pigs fed the other diets. Gain:feed did not differ significantly among diets. Average daily gain and ADFI of pigs did not differ among diets that did not contain SDBP. In conclusion, during the initial 2 wk post-weaning, pigs housed in unsanitary pens and fed non-medicated diets with APP in Exp. 1, or APP, EHSY, CB, or IEGG in Exp. 2 had equivalent performance to pigs fed SPC; however, performance of pigs fed diets with the alternatives was not equivalent to diets containing SDPP in Exp. 1 or SDBP in Exp. 2.","publish_time":"2017-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crenshaw, J.

Usually, RdRp domains are readily identifiable by comparative sequence analysis, but biochemical confirmation and characterization can be hampered by intrinsic protein properties and technical complications. It is presumed that replication and transcription of the \u223C30-kb severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA genome are catalyzed by an RdRp domain in the C-terminal part of nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12), one of 16 replicase subunits. However, thus far full-length nsp12 has proven refractory to expression in bacterial systems, which has hindered both the biochemical characterization of coronavirus RNA synthesis and RdRp-targeted antiviral drug design. Here, we describe a combined strategy involving bacterial expression of an nsp12 fusion protein and its in vivo cleavage to generate and purify stable SARS-CoV nsp12 (106 kDa) with a natural N-terminus and C-terminal hexahistidine tag. This recombinant protein possesses robust in vitro RdRp activity, as well as a significant DNA-dependent activity that may facilitate future inhibitor studies. The SARS-CoV nsp12 is primer dependent on both homo- and heteropolymeric templates, supporting the likeliness of a close enzymatic collaboration with the intriguing RNA primase activity that was recently proposed for coronavirus nsp8.","publish_time":"2009-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"te Velthuis, Aartjan J.

The global disease burden attributable to cryptosporidiosis is substantial and the only approved chemotherapeutic, nitazoxanide, has poor efficacy in HIV positive children. Chemotherapeutic development is dependent on the calf model of cryptosporidiosis, which is the best approximation of human disease. However, the model is not consistently applied across research studies. Data collection commonly occurs using two different methods: Complete Fecal Collection (CFC), which requires use of confinement housing, and Interval Collection (IC), which permits use of box stalls. CFC mimics human challenge model methodology but it is unknown if confinement housing impacts study end-points and if data gathered via this method is suitable for generalization to human populations. METHODS: Using a modified crossover study design we compared CFC and IC and evaluated the impact of housing on study end-points. At birth, calves were randomly assigned to confinement (n = 14) or box stall housing (n = 9), or were challenged with 5 x 10(7) C. parvum oocysts, and followed for 10 days. Study end-points included fecal oocyst shedding, severity of diarrhea, degree of dehydration, and plasma cortisol. FINDINGS: Calves in confinement had no significant differences in mean log oocysts enumerated per gram of fecal dry matter between CFC and IC samples (P = 0.6), nor were there diurnal variations in oocyst shedding (P = 0.1). Confinement housed calves shed significantly more oocysts (P = 0.05), had higher plasma cortisol (P = 0.001), and required more supportive care (P = 0.0009) than calves in box stalls. CONCLUSION: Housing method confounds study end-points in the calf model of cryptosporidiosis. Due to increased stress data collected from calves in confinement housing may not accurately estimate the efficacy of chemotherapeutics targeting C. parvum.","publish_time":"2018-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graef, Geneva; Hurst, Natalie J.; Kidder, Lance; Sy, Tracy L.; Goodman, Laura B.; Preston, Whitney D.; Arnold, Samuel L.

Clinical and epidemiologic findings of all COVID-19 cases in Singapore through March 16 were reviewed to determine whether presymptomatic transmission might have occurred. Presymptomatic transmission was defined as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person (source patient) to a secondary patient before the source patient developed symptoms, as ascertained by exposure and symptom onset dates, with no evidence that the secondary patient had been exposed to anyone else with COVID-19. Seven COVID-19 epidemiologic clusters in which presymptomatic transmission likely occurred were identified, and 10 such cases within these clusters accounted for 6.4% of the 157 locally acquired cases. In the four clusters for which the date of exposure could be determined, presymptomatic transmission occurred 1-3 days before symptom onset in the presymptomatic source patient. To account for the possibility of presymptomatic transmission, officials developing contact tracing protocols should strongly consider including a period before symptom onset.

This coronavirus is a virulent mutant of the harmless, ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). To date, feline coronavirus (FCoV) research has been hampered by the lack of susceptible cell lines for the propagation of serotype I FCoVs. In this study, long-term feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures were established from primary ileocytes and colonocytes by simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen- and human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT)-induced immortalization. Subsequently, these cultures were evaluated for their usability in FCoV research. Firstly, the replication capacity of the serotype II strains WSU 79\u20131683 and WSU 79\u20131146 was studied in the continuous cultures as was done for the primary cultures. In accordance with the results obtained in primary cultures, FCoV WSU 79\u20131683 still replicated significantly more efficient compared to FCoV WSU 79\u20131146 in both continuous cultures. In addition, the cultures were inoculated with faecal suspensions from healthy cats and with faecal or tissue suspensions from FIP cats. The cultures were susceptible to infection with different serotype I enteric strains and two of these strains were further propagated. No infection was seen in cultures inoculated with FIPV tissue homogenates. In conclusion, a new reliable model for FCoV investigation and growth of enteric field strains was established. In contrast to FIPV strains, FECVs showed a clear tropism for intestinal epithelial cells, giving an explanation for the observation that FECV is the main pathotype circulating among cats.","publish_time":"2013-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desmarets, Lowiese MB; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Olyslaegers, Dominique AJ; Dedeurwaerder, Annelike; Vermeulen, Ben L; Roukaerts, Inge DM; Nauwynck, Hans J","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39ab5e6b24f55e696076c53f96fc5704ff3ff0f0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3765525.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-44-71; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23964891/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FECV","WSU","FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary cultures","continuous cultures","strains WSU","FCoV WSU","enteric strains","feline coronavirus","FIPV strains","long-term feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures","FCoV research","ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus","FIP cats","feline infectious peritonitis virus","FCoV investigation","healthy cats","growth of enteric field strains","faecal suspensions","primary ileocytes","different serotype","tissue suspensions","propagation of serotype","FIPV tissue homogenates","infection","intestinal epithelial cells","simian virus","lack of susceptible cell lines","feared infectious cause of death","induced immortalization","clear tropism","human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase","T-antigen","hTERT","FECVs","new reliable model","SV40","colonocytes","explanation","study","virulent mutant","observation","main pathotype","results","replication capacity","conclusion","contrast","usability","date","FCoVs","accordance","addition"],"language":"en"},

Currently, the oral passive immunization using chicken IgY has been focused as an alternative to antibiotics for the treatment and control of diarrhea in animals and humans. This systematic review was focused to determine the effect of IgY in controlling and preventing diarrhea in domesticated animals including Piglets, Mice, Poultry and Calves. METHODS AND RESULTS: Previous research reports focused on treatment effect of Chicken IgY against diarrhea were retrieved from different electronic data bases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPRINGER-LINK, WILEY, AGRICOLA, MEDWELL Journals, Scientific Publish, Chinese articles from Core periodicals in 2012). A total of 61 studies in 4 different animal classes met the inclusion criteria. Data on study characteristics and outcome measures were extracted. The pooled relative risk (RR) of 49 studies of different animals [Piglets \u2013 22; Mice \u2013 14; Poultry \u2013 7 and Calves \u2013 6] in meta-analyses revealed that, IgY significantly reduced the risk of diarrhea in treatment group when compare to the placebo. However, the 95% confidence intervals of the majority of studies in animal class piglets and calves embrace RR of one. The same results were obtained in sub group analyses (treatment regiment \u2013 prophylactic or therapeutic; pathogen type \u2013 bacterial or viral). Perhaps, this inconsistency in the effect of IgY at the individual study level and overall effect measures could be influenced by the methodological heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis demonstrated the beneficial effect of IgY. This supports the opinion that IgY is useful for prophylaxis and treatment. However, more intensive studies using the gold standard animal experiments with the focus to use IgY alone or in combination with other alternative strategies are indispensable.","publish_time":"2014-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diraviyam, Thirumalai; Zhao, Bin; Wang, Yuan; Schade, Ruediger; Michael, Antonysamy; Zhang, Xiaoying","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a80b756097aea945ba90510f7fa55cc84f849686.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4028221.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0097716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24846286/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs4ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MEDWELL Journals"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment effect of Chicken","treatment group","studies of different animals","treatment regiment","risk of diarrhea","Calves","beneficial effect","overall effect measures","majority of studies","intensive studies","control of diarrhea","animal class piglets","different animal classes","domesticated animals","meta-analyses","Mice","RESULTS","Poultry","different electronic data bases","sub group analyses","present systematic review","gold standard animal experiments","serum immunoglobulin","outcome measures","study characteristics","meta-analysis","passive immunity","alternative strategies","individual study level","oral passive immunization","pooled relative risk","EMBASE","MEDLINE","Previous research reports","Scientific","MEDWELL Journals","AGRICOLA","WILEY","SPRINGER-LINK","Chinese articles","pathogen type","birds","SR","antibodies","reptiles","amphibians","METHODS","focus","inclusion criteria","Core periodicals","combination","embryos","offspring","BACKGROUND","confidence intervals","yolk","CONCLUSION","prophylaxis","antibiotics","humans","opinion","placebo","total","methodological heterogeneity","inconsistency"],"language":"en"},

Escherichia coli was isolated from 37 faeces samples, Enterococcus ssp. was isolated from 22 faeces samples and Salmonella was isolated from one faeces sample in diarrhoeic calves. Furthermore, only E. coli was isolated from all 18 faeces samples of healthy calves. Of the 37 E. coli isolated from diarrhoeic calves, K99 (18.9%), F41 (18.9%), heat\u2010stable enterotoxin a (STa) (18.9%), Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1; 13.5%) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2; 5.4%) and intimin (8.1%) genes were identified by multiplex PCR. Of the 18 E. coli isolated from healthy calves, K99 (16.6%) and intimin (55.5%) genes were identified by PCR. A total of 15 rotavirus, 11 coronavirus and 11 E. coli K99 were detected in diarrhoeic calves by the antigen ELISA. As a result, this study shows that rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli and Enterococcus ssp. were determined to play a role in the aetiology of diarrhoea in the neonatal calves. K99, F41, STa, Stx1 and Stx2 were found as the most common virulence gene markers of E. coli strains isolated from calves with diarrhoea. Multiplex PCR may be useful for characterization of E. coli isolated from calves.","publish_time":"2008-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ok, M.; G\u00FCler, L.; Turgut, K.; Ok, \u00DC.; \u015Een, I.; G\u00FCnd\u00FCz, I.

We demonstrate its capability on real-world hostile IO campaigns with Twitter datasets collected during the 2017 French presidential elections, and known IO accounts disclosed by Twitter.

The rapid spread of the virus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID-19 infected cases. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19: information on the disease is very limited and scattered even if it exists. This motivates the use of data integration, combining data from diverse sources and eliciting useful information with a unified view of them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates global data for real-time prediction of infection trajectory for multiple countries. Because the proposed model takes advantage of borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an existing individual country-based model. As fully Bayesian way has been adopted, the model provides a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, the proposed model uses countrywide covariates to adjust infection trajectories in curve fitting. A joint variable selection technique has been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to identify possible country-level risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Se Yoon; Lei, Bowen; Mallick, Bani K.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fc1142d41159cecba1144c7747ecba32d77dfc0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00662v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["US Food and Drug Administration"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","Bayesian hierarchical model","global data","multiple countries","useful information","existing individual country-based model","severe disease","use of data integration","advantage of borrowing information","novel coronavirus disease","proposed modeling scheme","infection trajectories","global health","Bayesian way","real-time prediction of infection trajectory","possible country-level risk factors","diverse sources","countrywide covariates","powerful predictive tool","US Food","uncertainty quantification","surge","Drug Administration","curve fitting","big threat","joint variable selection technique","therapeutics","pandemic","unified view","infected cases","rapid spread","paper","world","drugs"],"language":"en"},

Contact tracing provides a mechanism of identifying individuals with a high likelihood of previous exposure to a contagious disease, allowing additional precautions to be put in place to prevent continued transmission. Here we consider a cryptographic approach to contact tracing based on secure two-party computation (2PC). We begin by considering the problem of comparing a set of location histories held by two parties to determine whether they have come within some threshold distance while at the same time maintaining the privacy of the location histories. We propose a solution to this problem using pre-shared keys, adapted from an equality testing protocol due to Ishai et al [2]. We discuss how this protocol can be used to maintain privacy within practical contact tracing scenarios, including both app-based approaches and approaches which leverage location history held by telecoms and internet service providers. We examine the efficiency of this approach and show that existing infrastructure is sufficient to support anonymised contact tracing at a national level.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fitzsimons, Jack K.; Mantri, Atul; Pisarczyk, Robert; Rainforth, Tom; Zhao, Zhikuan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec6f213d8901bc2e0da73d1421129a84c72503dc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05116v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anonymised contact tracing","utility of contact tracing","practical contact tracing scenarios","location history","privacy","set of location histories","problem","app-based approaches","contagious disease","cryptographic approach","equality testing protocol","high likelihood of previous exposure","secure two-party computation","social distancing","telecoms","individuals","pandemic","pre-shared keys","existing infrastructure","case isolation","place","important tool","internet service providers","additional precautions","Ishai et","time","mechanism","national level","PC","spread","solution","current COVID","continued transmission","threshold distance","parties","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. In addition, data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must naturally be incorporated into the models. In this work we address both these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of the epidemiological model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The importance of the timing and intensity of interventions is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people.

Our model reaches a ROC of 0.8629 (\u002B/-0.0058), outperforming the traditional SAPS-II score and providing enhanced interpretability when compared with similar Deep Learning approaches.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caicedo-Torres, William; Gutierrez, Jairo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43180f7a446ea362f009a9e0fb03baa32c93142d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09284v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyMTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Units"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hand deep learning","powerful Deep Learning models","similar Deep Learning approaches","Accurate mortality prediction","clinical practice","medical data","enhanced interpretability","sound medical knowledge","additional interpretability tools","simple statistical models","predictions","correlations","times","Intensive Care Units","ICUs","visual explanations","diagnosis","raw nursing notes","patient death risk","sub-optimal performance","score","trust","patients","question","MIMIC","unexpected outcomes","use of AI","word importance","work","traditional SAPS","clinicians","ROC"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized (C), decentralized (D), and combined (C\u002BD) social distancing strategies, and analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with the centralized one. Indeed, the (C\u002BD) is the most efficient isolation strategy at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for the (C\u002BD) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to understand and control over an extended period of time.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Topirceanu, Alexandru; Udrescu, Mihai; Marculescu, Radu","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a09b5689e7adb802169d21318b0ffd427cff11c4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04222v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C isolation","D isolation","social distancing strategies","centralized social distancing","stronger social distancing","social ties","different degrees of social distancing","reactive isolation strategies","efficient isolation strategy","pandemic","various social networks","high social relevance","non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies","adoption of isolation measures","spreading","decentralized strategy","outbreak onset","dynamics of COVID","reactive response","control","study","understanding","new pathogen","possible response","best results","highest node degrees","new epidemic model","heterogeneous complex networks","extended period of time","network superspreaders","human interactions","insights","region","SICARS","month","impact of proactive","efficiency","peak infection ratio","SARS-CoV","alarming effects","investigations","space","analysis","infectious diseases","delayed enforcement","initial values"],"language":"en"},

As a consequence, specific mitigation strategies must be introduced. We characterize the relative importance of different broad strategies by accounting for two fundamental sources of heterogeneity, i.e. geography and demography. First, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative entities, in which social interactions between age classs occur. Due to the sparsity of the inter-regional mobility matrix, once started the epidemics tend to develop independently across areas, justifying the adoption of solutions specific to individual regions or to clusters of regions. Second, we show that social contacts between age classes play a fundamental role and that measures which take into account the age structure of the population can provide a significant contribution to mitigate the rebound effects.

Yet, the development of prevention strategies remains a challenging process, as epidemics are non-linear and complex processes. For this reason, we investigate a deep reinforcement learning approach to automatically learn prevention strategies in the context of pandemic influenza. Firstly, we construct a new epidemiological meta-population model, with 379 patches (one for each administrative district in Great Britain), that adequately captures the infection process of pandemic influenza. Our model balances complexity and computational efficiency such that the use of reinforcement learning techniques becomes attainable. Secondly, we set up a ground truth such that we can evaluate the performance of the \u0027Proximal Policy Optimization\u0027 algorithm to learn in a single district of this epidemiological model. Finally, we consider a large-scale problem, by conducting an experiment where we aim to learn a joint policy to control the districts in a community of 11 tightly coupled districts, for which no ground truth can be established. This experiment shows that deep reinforcement learning can be used to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state space. Moreover, through this experiment, we demonstrate that there can be an advantage to consider collaboration between districts when designing prevention strategies.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Libin, Pieter; Moonens, Arno; Verstraeten, Timothy; Perez-Sanjines, Fabian; Hens, Niel; Lemey, Philippe; Now\u0027e, Ann","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13676v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["districts","experiment","development of prevention strategies","deep reinforcement learning approach","complex epidemiological models","use of reinforcement learning techniques","ground truth","new epidemiological meta-population model","infection process of pandemic influenza","model balances complexity","context of pandemic influenza","challenging process","administrative district","complex processes","single district","joint policy","Epidemics of infectious diseases","Proximal Policy Optimization","important threat","public health","computational efficiency","algorithm","patches","large state space","global economies","mitigation policies","collaboration","performance","Great Britain","large-scale problem","advantage","reason","community"],"language":"en"},

As a result, three findings and a policy proposal have been obtained. First, the height of the peaks in the time sequence of the number of infection cases tends to get reduced corresponding to the upper bound of the size of groups where all members meet. Second, if we adopt the constraint on m0, the number of all other people one meets separately each at a time, to the range between 2 and 8, its effect on the suppression of infections may be weak as far as we allow group meetings of size W of 8 or larger. Third, such a moderate constraint may temporarily seem to work for the reduction of infections in the early stage but it may turn out to be just a delay of peaks. Based on these results, a policy is proposed here: for quickly suppressing the number of infections, restrict W to less than 4 if the constraint to make m0 at most 1 is too strict. If W is set to less than 4, setting m0 to 4 or less works for quick reduction of infections according to the result.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ohsawa, Yukio","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2242bb35993b5306fbc74b277db7ccbe6ebbed98.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09372v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["number of infections","m0","suppression of infections","quick reduction of infections","number of infection cases","real life","scale-free network","moderate constraint","group meetings of size W","real-space urban life of people","generated communities","size of groups","time sequence","spatiotemporal constraints","policy proposal","delay of peaks","spreading of virus infection","modeling on-line communities","peoples\u0027 social behaviors","reduced corresponding","aim","artificial human networks","findings","early stage","meets","members","effect","height","results","range"],"language":"en"},

The discussion is framed around two broad themes: 1) the biology of the virus itself and 2) the characteristics of the infection of a single human host. Our one-page summary provides the key numbers pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, based mostly on peer-reviewed literature. The numbers reported in summary format are substantiated by the annotated references below. Readers are urged to remember that much uncertainty remains and knowledge of this pandemic and the virus driving it is rapidly evolving.

Early detection and isolation of potentially susceptible crowds can effectively control the epidemic of its disease. Existing metrics can not correctly address the infected rate on trajectories. To solve this problem, we propose a novel spatio-temporal infected rate (IR) measure based on human moving trajectories that can adequately describe the risk of being infected by a given query trajectory of a patient. Then, we manage source data through an efficient spatio-temporal index to make our system more scalable, and can quickly query susceptible crowds from massive trajectories. Besides, we design several pruning strategies that can effectively reduce calculations. Further, we design a spatial first time (SFT) index, which enables us to quickly query multiple trajectories without much I/O consumption and data redundancy. The performance of the solutions is demonstrated in experiments based on real and synthetic trajectory datasets that have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our solutions.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Huajun; Li, Ruiyuan; Wang, Rubin; Bao, Jie; Zheng, Yu; Li, Tianrui","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23202067b68fabd242f610252e7813b2ef116710.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06653v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["massive trajectories","multiple trajectories","person","novel spatio-temporal infected rate","susceptible crowds","human moving trajectories","given query trajectory","solutions","efficient spatio-temporal index","data redundancy","source data","synthetic trajectory datasets","measure","emergency event","O consumption","effectiveness","experiments","isolation","Early detection","global public","time","SFT","epidemic","Virus transmission","system","patient","pruning strategies","calculations","efficiency","problem","risk","Existing metrics","disease","performance"],"language":"en"},

Several studies have shown that tomographic patterns seen on chest Computed Tomography (CT), such as ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving pattern, are correlated with the disease severity and progression. CT imaging can thus emerge as an important modality for the management of COVID-19 patients. AI-based solutions can be used to support CT based quantitative reporting and make reading efficient and reproducible if quantitative biomarkers, such as the Percentage of Opacity (PO), can be automatically computed. However, COVID-19 has posed unique challenges to the development of AI, specifically concerning the availability of appropriate image data and annotations at scale. In this paper, we propose to use synthetic datasets to augment an existing COVID-19 database to tackle these challenges. We train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to inpaint COVID-19 related tomographic patterns on chest CTs from patients without infectious diseases. Additionally, we leverage location priors derived from manually labeled COVID-19 chest CTs patients to generate appropriate abnormality distributions. Synthetic data are used to improve both lung segmentation and segmentation of COVID-19 patterns by adding 20% of synthetic data to the real COVID-19 training data. We collected 2143 chest CTs, containing 327 COVID-19 positive cases, acquired from 12 sites across 7 countries. By testing on 100 COVID-19 positive and 100 control cases, we show that synthetic data can help improve both lung segmentation (\u002B6.02% lesion inclusion rate) and abnormality segmentation (\u002B2.78% dice coefficient), leading to an overall more accurate PO computation (\u002B2.82% Pearson coefficient).","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Siqi; Georgescu, Bogdan; Xu, Zhoubing; Yoo, Youngjin; Chabin, Guillaume; Chaganti, Shikha; Grbic, Sasa; Piat, Sebastian; Teixeira, Brian; Balachandran, Abishek; Vishwanath, RS; Re, Thomas; Comaniciu, Dorin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/afa78da4dd963334c0c6cc8defa312a57ebeb817.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01903v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Generative Adversarial Network"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["segmentation of COVID","inpaint COVID","real COVID","management of COVID","existing COVID","chest CTs patients","abnormality segmentation","lung segmentation","training data","synthetic datasets","chest Computed Tomography","availability of appropriate image data","related tomographic patterns","positive cases","CT imaging","appropriate abnormality distributions","AI-based solutions","quantitative biomarkers","quantitative reporting","control cases","development of AI","unique challenges","disease severity","Pearson coefficient","dice coefficient","Coronavirus Disease","accurate PO computation","reading efficient","consolidations","GAN","annotations","lesion inclusion rate","crazy paving pattern","ground-glass opacities","Generative Adversarial Network","scale","infectious diseases","important modality","Percentage of Opacity","sites","database","progression","studies","location priors","testing","countries","paper","people","deaths"],"language":"en"},

While vaccines are still under development, social distancing, extensive testing, and quarantining of confirmed infected subjects remain the most effective measures to contain the pandemic. These measures carry a significant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a novel optimization-based decision-making framework for managing the COVID-19 outbreak in the US. This includes modeling the dynamics of affected populations, estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimal control strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that the number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensive computational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most effective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infected subjects having a much higher impact. Further, we find that\u0022on-off\u0022policies alternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions can be effective at\u0022flattening\u0022the curve while likely minimizing social and economic cost.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsay, Calvin; Lejarza, Fernando; Stadtherr, Mark A.; Baldea, Michael","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a04cdce6378e5d3eaa7e15191c2c9ada5ac70bc5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06291v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sequencing social distancing","strict social distancing","quarantining","effective measures","extensive testing","infected subjects","COVID","testing events","novel optimization","number of infections","extensive computational efforts","significant socioeconomic cost","increasing number of fatalities","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","data","optimal control strategy","model parameters","restrictions","development","hidden states","decision-making framework","curve","dynamics of affected populations","disease","analysis","flattening","higher impact","policies","unprecedented spread","outbreak","vaccines","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

We develop a SIR-type model taking into account the presence of asymptomatic, or however undetected, infective, and the substantially long time these spend being infective and not isolated. In the second part of the note, we apply our model to the COVID-19 epidemics in Northern Italy, by numerical simulations based on estimate of certain parameters on the basisof medical evidence, and on fit of the other parameters from data on the first decade of March; the simulations reproduce quite satisfactorily the developements in the subsequent week, at difference with the standard SIR model. Our simulations show that if no actions were taken, the estimates based on this model would be about one third of those based on the SIR model as far as the height of the epidemic peak is concerned, and about half for what concerns the time scale of the epidemics. Moreover, the model suggests that an overwhelming part of the population would be in contact with the virus, most of them with no or very little symptoms. We also consider the situation in which the restrictive measures are taken into account by a\u0022reduction factor\u0022, and discuss on the one hand how a prompt isolation of asymptomatic infectives would change the dynamics in this framework, and on the other what the time-scale could be in this context; this both in the\u0022mitigation\u0022scenario, in which the measures taken only reduce the epidemic, and in the\u0022eradication\u0022one, in which the measures raise sufficiently the epidemc threshold, as it appears to have happened in China.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaeta, Giuseppe","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80d5d435bef865376def1b095e35a1aae8043d36.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08720v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["standard SIR model","SIR-type model","presence of asymptomatic","time scale","time-scale","account","numerical simulations","epidemics","epidemic peak","restrictive measures","long time","large cohort of asymptomatic infectives","prompt isolation of asymptomatic infectives","ongoing COVID","estimate of certain parameters","basisof medical evidence","fit","Northern Italy","difference","height","subsequent week","data","developements","hand","half","dynamics","decade","contact","population","difficult problems","reduction factor","scenario","epidemc threshold","actions","situation","estimates","little symptoms","virus","mitigation","framework","context","eradication","note","China"],"language":"en"},

BASIGIN controls tumour metabolism, particularly glycolysis by facilitating lactic acid export through the two monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and hypoxia-inducible MCT4. However, before being recognized as a co-carrier of MCTs, BASIGIN was described as an inducer of extracellular matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Early on, a model emerged in which, tumour cells use the extracellular domain of BASIGIN to recognize and stimulate neighbouring fibroblasts to produce MMPs. However, this model has remained hypothetical since a direct link between BASIGIN and MMPs production has not yet been clearly established. To validate the BASIGIN/MMP hypothesis, we developed BASIGIN knockouts in three human tumour cell lines derived from glioma, colon, and lung adenocarcinoma. By using co-culture experiments of either human or mouse fibroblasts and tumour cell lines we showed, contrary to what has been abundantly published, that the disruption of BASIGIN in tumour cells and in MEFs has no action on the production of MMPs. Our findings do not support the notion that the pro-tumoural action of BASIGIN is mediated via induction of MMPs. Therefore, we propose that to date, the strongest pro-tumoural action of BASIGIN is mediated through the control of fermentative glycolysis.","publish_time":"2015-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marchiq, Ibtissam; Albrengues, Jean; Granja, Sara; Gaggioli, C\u00E9dric; Pouyss\u00E9gur, Jacques; Simon, Marie-Pierre","journal":"Oncotarget","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26e8ef0fab0bc606adadae018a73d8490c8e1cd5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4694784.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4694784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["BASIGIN"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BASIGIN knockouts","disruption of BASIGIN","extracellular domain of BASIGIN","BASIGIN controls tumour metabolism","strongest pro-tumoural action of BASIGIN","tumour cells","MMPs production","production of MMPs","induction of MMPs","human tumour cell lines","model","mouse fibroblasts","neighbouring fibroblasts","co-culture experiments","control of fermentative glycolysis","co-carrier of MCTs","inducer of extracellular matrix metalloproteases","glioma","monocarboxylate transporters MCT1","lactic acid export","direct link","colon","EMMPRIN","multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein","hypoxia-inducible MCT4","MEFs","CD147","notion","date","MMP hypothesis","tumours","lung adenocarcinoma","findings"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: In total, 24 semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with informants from public health units and the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. A web survey of public health managers in the province was also carried out. RESULTS: A mix of facilitators and barriers was identified. Leadership and organizational cultures, conducive to CQI success were evident. However, limitations in performance measurement and managerial discretion were key barriers.

To investigate the requirements for frameshifting at the gag-pro overlap, we have inserted a stretch of 58 nucleotides containing the proposed frameshift signal into a plasmid that allows monitoring of translation in all three reading frames. In vitro translation of mRNAs derived from this plasmid indicated that the 58 nucleotides from the SRV-1 gag-pro overlap were sufficient to induce an efficient -1 shift in a heterologous context. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the slip site is formed at the heptanucleotide G GGA AAC. The frameshift efficiency of the wild type sequence in rabbit reticulocyte lysate was 23%. A second component of the frameshift signal is formed by a pseudoknot seven bases downstream of the slip site. The presence of this pseudoknot was confirmed by mutational analysis, employing complementary and compensatory base changes, and by probing the structure of short RNA transcripts containing the frameshift signal. Adding increasing amounts of an SRV-1 pseudoknot containing RNA transcript to a translation reaction programmed with an SRV-1 frameshift reporter mRNA had no effect on the frameshift efficiency, arguing against the role of a specific pseudoknot-recognising factor in the frameshifting process.","publish_time":"1994-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"ten Dam, E; Brierley, I; Inglis, S; Pleij, C","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC523688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SRV","frameshift efficiency","proposed frameshift signal","frameshift reporter mRNA","gag-pro overlap","plasmid","monitoring of translation","translation reaction","Mutational analysis","slip site","nucleotides","ribosomal frameshifting","frameshifting process","translation of mRNAs","specific pseudoknot-recognising factor","structure of short RNA transcripts","wild type sequence","rabbit reticulocyte lysate","role","effect","pol genes of simian retrovirus","compensatory base changes","heptanucleotide G GGA AAC","fusion protein","stretch","bases","heterologous context","reading frames","increasing amounts","parts","requirements","component","presence"],"language":"en"},

Frameshifting is more frequent at sites where the in-frame codon ends in uridine, as if third position wobble pairs to message uridine facilitate slippage into the \u002B1 frame. Consistent with other studies of programmed frameshift sites, efficient frameshifting depends on stable message:tRNA base pairs after rephasing. For complexes with mispairs, frameshift frequency depends on the nature, number, and position of mispairs. Central purine:purine mispairs are especially inhibitory. Relative stabilities of \u002B1 rephased complexes are estimated from published data on the stabilities of tRNA:tRNA complexes.

The signal responsible for efficient frameshift is composed of the slippery site UUUAAAU followed by a sequence that has the potential to adopt two alternative folding patterns, either a structure involving a pseudoknot, or a simple stem-loop structure. To investigate the structure requirements for efficient frameshifting, mutants in the stem-loop or in the potential pseudoknot regions of a Polish isolate of PLRV (PLRV-P) have been analyzed. Mutations that are located in the second stem (S2) of the potential pseudoknot structure, but are located in unpaired regions of the alternative stem-loop structure, reduce frameshift efficiency. Deletion of the 3\u0027 end sequence of the alternative stem-loop structure does not reduce frameshift efficiency. Our results confirm that -1 frameshift in the overlap region depends on the slippery site and on the downstream positioned sequence, and propose that in PLRV-P a pseudoknot is required for efficient frameshifting.

A subset of these patients develops refractory hypoxaemia despite maximal conventional mechanical ventilation and require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This review focuses on considerations for ventilatory strategies, infection control and patient selection related to ECMO for ARDS in a pandemic. We also summarize the experiences with ECMO in previous respiratory pandemics. METHODS A review of pertinent studies was conducted via a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar. References of articles were also examined to identify other relevant publications. RESULTS Since the H1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009, the use of ECMO for ARDS continues to grow despite limitations in evidence for survival benefit. There is emerging evidence to suggest that lung protective ventilation for ARDS can be further optimized while receiving ECMO so as to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury and subsequent contributions to multi-organ failure. Efforts to improve outcomes should also encompass appropriate infection control measures to reduce co-infections and prevent nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses. Patient selection for ECMO in a pandemic can be challenging. We discuss important ethical considerations and predictive scoring systems that may assist clinical decision-making to optimize resource allocation. CONCLUSION The role of ECMO in managing ARDS during respiratory pandemics continues to grow. This is supported by efforts to redefine optimal ventilatory strategies, reinforce infection control measures and enhance patient selection.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Joel Kian Boon; Qadri, Syeda Kashfi; Toh, Theresa Shu Wen; Lin, Cheryl Bin; Mok, Yee Hui; Lee, Jan Hau","journal":"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296808/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["INTRODUCTION Epidemics","ARDS","ECMO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARDS","use of ECMO","role of ECMO","patient selection","previous respiratory pandemics","zoonotic respiratory viruses","appropriate infection control measures","nosocomial transmission of novel respiratory viruses","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Efforts","optimal ventilatory strategies","lung protective ventilation","H1N1 Influenza pandemic","patients progress","novel coronavirus","emerging evidence","important ethical considerations","review of pertinent studies","maximal conventional mechanical ventilation","ventilator-induced lung injury","subsequent contributions","significant global intensive care burden","refractory hypoxaemia","co-infections","predictive scoring systems","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","clinical decision-making","search","multi-organ failure","INTRODUCTION Epidemics","MEDLINE","EMBASE","limitations","outcomes","experiences","Google Scholar","resource allocation","survival benefit","METHODS","subset","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","References of articles","relevant publications"],"language":"en"},

Preventive treatment has an important role to control and avoid the spread of severe respiratory disease, but often is difficult to obtain and sometimes cannot be effective to reduce the risk of deterioration of the underlining lung pathology. In order to define an effective and safe treatment for SARS-CoV-2-associated disease, we provide considerations on the actual treatments, on how to avoid complications and the undesirable side effects related to them and to select and apply earlier the most appropriate treatment. Approaching to treat severe respiratory disease in infants and children, the risks related to the development of atelectasis starting invasive or non-invasive ventilation support and the risk of oxygen toxicity must be taken into serious consideration. For an appropriate and effective approach to treat severe pediatric respiratory diseases, two main different strategies can be proposed according to the stage and severity of the patient conditions: patient in the initial phase and with non-severe lung pathology and patient with severe initial respiratory impairment and/or with delay in arrival to observation.

Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies. Methods Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HIV amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available. Results Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days). Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US. Conclusions Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices. Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hill, Andrew; Wang, Junzheng; Levi, Jacob; Heath, Katie; Fortunak, Joseph","journal":"Journal of virus eradication","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405423/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["low costs","minimum production costs","Minimum estimated costs of production","Methods Minimum costs of production","low prices","COVID","existing drugs","Current prices","promising drugs","costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients","current list prices","affordable access","vital treatment","efficacy","affordable cost","pricing data","treatment course","analysis","established methodology","help","price negotiations","good predictive accuracy","medicines","hepatitis C","range of countries","global export shipment records","mass availability","equity","Repurposing","daclatasvir","sofosbuvir","ritonavir","lopinavir","azithromycin","hydroxychloroquine","favipiravir","remdesivir","route of chemical synthesis","various stages of clinical trials","HIV","Introduction","Estimations","middle-income economies","mortality","days","pirfenidone","Conclusions","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Design Multicentre retrospective observational cohort study. Setting Three multidisciplinary intensive care units (ICUs) in Hong Kong. Participants All adult critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to ICUs in Hong Kong between 22 January and 11 February 2020. Main outcome measure 28-day mortality. Results Eight out of 49 patients with COVID-19 (16%) were admitted to Hong Kong ICUs during the study period. The median age was 64.5 years (range, 42\u201370) with a median admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 6 (IQR, 4\u20137). Six patients (75%) required mechanical ventilation, six patients (75%) required vasopressors and two (25%) required renal replacement therapy. None of the patients required prone ventilation, nitric oxide or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median times to shock reversal and extubation were 9 and 11 days respectively. At 28 days, one patient (12%) had died and the remaining seven (88%) all survived to ICU discharge. Only one of the survivors (14%) still required oxygen at 28 days. Conclusion Critically ill patients with COVID-19 often require a moderate duration of mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. Most of these patients recover and survive to ICU discharge with supportive care using lung protective ventilation strategies, avoiding excess fluids, screening and treating bacterial co-infection, and timely intubation. Lower rather than upper respiratory tract viral burden correlates with clinical severity of illness.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ling, Lowell; So, Christina; Shum, Hoi Ping; Chan, Paul K S; Lai, Christopher K C; Kandamby, Darshana H; Ho, Eunise; So, Dominic; Yan, Wing Wa; Lui, Grace; Leung, Wai Shing; Chan, Man Chun; Gomersall, Charles D","journal":"Critical care and resuscitation : journal of the Australasian Academy of Critical Care Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32248675/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","ICU"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["ill patients","Hong Kong ICUs","days","prone ventilation","supportive care","confirmed COVID","moderate duration of mechanical ventilation","median age","median times","ICU discharge","lung protective ventilation strategies","multidisciplinary intensive care units","study period","day mortality","day outcomes","median admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment","Design Multicentre retrospective observational cohort study","upper respiratory tract viral burden correlates","SOFA","excess fluids","nitric oxide","bacterial co-infection","screening","clinical severity of illness","score","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","adult","vasopressor support","coronavirus disease","timely intubation","Main outcome measure","extubation","cases","treatments","years","range","reversal","Participants","Conclusion","renal replacement therapy","IQR","Objective","Results","vasopressors","survivors"],"language":"en"},

Using electron microscopy, it was found that there were more spike-rich particles in the virus samples purified by GC than in those purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (SDGC). In addition, the hemagglutination unit [log10 (infectivity titer/hemagglutination titer)] of GC-purified virus samples was \u223C 10 times lower than that of SDGC-purified virus samples.

Procalcitonin (PCT) treatment algorithms have been used successfully in Europe to safely reduce antibiotic use for LRTI but have not been adopted in the United States. We recently performed a feasibility study for a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of PCT and viral testing to guide therapy for non-pneumonic LRTI. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the current study was to understand factors influencing PCT algorithm adherence during the RCT and evaluate factors influencing provider antibiotic prescribing practices for LRTI. STUDY DESIGN: From October 2013-April 2014, 300 patients hospitalized at a community teaching hospital with non-pneumonic LRTI were randomized to standard or PCT-guided care with viral PCR testing. Algorithm adherence data was collected and multivariate stepwise logistic regression of clinical variables used to model algorithm compliance. 134 providers were surveyed anonymously before and after the trial to assess knowledge of biomarkers and viral testing and antibiotic prescribing practices. RESULTS: Diagnosis of pneumonia on admission was the only variable significantly associated with non-adherence [7% (adherence) vs. 26% (nonadherence), p = 0.01]. Surveys confirmed possible infiltrate on chest radiograph as important for provider decisions, as were severity of illness, positive sputum culture, abnormal CBC and fever. However, age, patient expectations and medical-legal concerns were also at least somewhat important to prescribing practices. Physician agreement with the importance of viral and PCT testing increased from 42% to 64% (p = 0.007) and 49% to 74% (p = 0.001), respectively, after the study. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal algorithm adherence will be important for definitive PCT intervention trials in the US to determine if PCT guided algorithms result in better outcomes than reliance on traditional clinical variables. Factors influencing treatment decisions such as patient age, presence of fever, patient expectations and medical legal concerns may be amenable to education to improve PCT algorithm compliance for LRTI.","publish_time":"2016-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Branche, Angela R.; Walsh, Edward E.; Jadhav, Nagesh; Karmally, Rachel; Baran, Andrea; Peterson, Derick R.; Falsey, Ann R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b004803f1a4688bfce9f28d13226f69403724f7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/624a9ba7d602b3d71fec89e1f4d53c3c46cfda78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4820114.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0152986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043012/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI","CBC"],"locations":["Europe","United States"],"keyphrases":["PCT testing","PCT algorithm adherence","PCT algorithm compliance","PCT guided algorithms","viral testing","non-adherence","PCT-guided care","non-pneumonic LRTI","Algorithm adherence data","Optimal algorithm adherence","viral PCR testing","factors","provider antibiotic prescribing practices","definitive PCT intervention trials","patient expectations","patient age","importance of viral","antibiotic overuse","antibiotic use","current study","feasibility study","STUDY DESIGN","randomized clinical trial","traditional clinical variables","RCT","medical-legal concerns","medical legal concerns","provider decisions","treatment decisions","treatment algorithms","multivariate stepwise logistic regression of clinical variables","severity of illness","presence of fever","primary objective","Lower respiratory tract illness","better outcomes","chest radiograph","positive sputum culture","reliance","community teaching hospital","education","therapy","abnormal CBC","possible infiltrate","knowledge of biomarkers","adult hospitalization","admission","Surveys","RATIONALE","Diagnosis of pneumonia","RESULTS","patients","Physician agreement","Europe","CONCLUSIONS","Procalcitonin","nonadherence","United States","providers"],"language":"en"},

Multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (MRT-PCR) assays for detection of multiple viruses are being used increasingly in clinical settings. METHODS: During January\u2013April 2012, outpatients with acute respiratory illness (\u22647 days) were tested for influenza using singleplex RT-PCR (SRT-PCR). A subset was assayed for 18 viruses using MRT-PCR to compare detection of influenza and examine the distribution of viruses and characteristics of patients using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 662 participants (6 months\u201382 years), detection of influenza was similar between the MRT-PCR and SRT-PCR (\u03BA = 0\u00B783). No virus was identified in 267 (40.3%) samples. Commonly detected viruses were human rhinovirus (HRV, 15\u00B74%), coronavirus (CoV, 10\u00B74%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 8\u00B74%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 8\u00B73%), and influenza (6%). Co-detections were infrequent (6\u00B79%) and most commonly occurred among those \u003C18 years old. In regression analyses, compared with non-viral illnesses, RSV and hMPV were significantly more frequent in children and less frequent in 18- to 49-year-olds than in those \u226550 years (P = 0\u00B701), fever was more common in hMPV and influenza infections (P = 0\u00B7008), nasal congestion was more frequent in CoV, HRV, hMPV, influenza and RSV infections (P = 0\u00B7001), and body mass index was higher among those with influenza (P = 0\u00B7036). CONCLUSIONS: Using MRT-PCR, a viral etiology was found in three-fifths of patients with medically attended outpatient visits for acute respiratory illness during the influenza season; co-detected viruses were infrequent.

The development of an FIP-preventive vaccine requires an antigen that does not induce antibody-dependent enhancement, and T helper (Th)1 activity plays an important role in protect against FIPV infection. In the present study, we identified synthetic peptides including Th1 and a linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope in the S1 domain and M protein of FIPV. We also identified peptides that strongly induce Th1 activity from those derived from the structural proteins (S, M, and N proteins) of FIPV based on this and previous studies (Satoh et al. [19]). No Th1 epitope-containing peptide was identified in the peptides derived from the S1 domain of type I FIPV. In contrast, 7 Th1 epitope-containing peptides were identified in the S1 domain of type II FIPV, and no linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope was contained in any of these peptides. Eleven Th1 epitope-containing peptides common to each serotype were identified in the M protein-derived peptides, and 2 peptides (M-11 and M-12) contained the linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope. Of the peptides derived from the S, M, and N proteins of FIPV, those that induced significantly stronger Th1 activity than that of the FIPV antigen were rescreened, and 4 peptides were identified. When 3 of these peptides (M-9, I-S2-15, and II-S1-24) were selected and administered with CpG-ODNs to SPF cats, M-9 and II-S1-24 induced Th1 activity.

However, studies that directly relate hospitalizations for exacerbation of COPD to ambient temperature are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of temperature on the number of hospitalizations for COPD. METHODS: This was a population-based study in a metropolitan area. All hospital discharges for acute exacerbation of COPD during 2009 in Barcelona and its metropolitan area were analyzed. The relationship between the number of hospitalizations for COPD and the mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures alongside comorbidity, humidity, influenza rate, and environmental pollution were studied. RESULTS: A total of 9,804 hospitalization discharges coded with COPD exacerbation as a primary diagnosis were included; 75.4% of cases were male with a mean age of 74.9\u00B110.5 years and an average length of stay of 6.5\u00B16.1 days. The highest number of admissions (3,644 [37.2%]) occurred during winter, followed by autumn with 2,367 (24.1%), spring with 2,347 (23.9%), and summer with 1,446 (14.7%; P\u003C0.001). The maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures were associated similarly with the number of hospitalizations. On average, we found that for each degree Celsius decrease in mean weekly temperature, hospital admissions increased by 5.04% (r(2)=0.591; P\u003C0.001). After adjustment for humidity, comorbidity, air pollution, and influenza-like illness, only mean temperatures retained statistical significance, with a mean increase of 4.7% in weekly admissions for each degree Celsius of temperature (r(2)=0.599, P\u003C0.001). CONCLUSION: Mean temperatures are closely and independently related to the number of hospitalizations for COPD.","publish_time":"2015-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almagro, Pere; Hernandez, Carme; Martinez-Cambor, Pable; Tresserras, Ricard; Escarrabill, Joan","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32412ffe52eb41da8ecfed314b703c49fd041f5c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4431472.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s75710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26056439/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":["Barcelona"],"keyphrases":["mean temperatures","COPD exacerbation","number of hospitalizations","mean weekly temperature","mean increase","mean age","acute exacerbation of COPD","maximum temperatures","highest number of admissions","degree Celsius of temperature","weekly admissions","hospital admissions","ambient temperature","influence of temperature","comorbidity","humidity","hospital discharges","minimum","metropolitan area","winter","degree Celsius decrease","influenza rate","air pollution","hospitalization discharges","environmental pollution","average length","population-based study","exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","statistical significance","tropics","illness","years","Barcelona","total","adjustment","cases","male","primary diagnosis","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","studies","relationship","CONCLUSION","METHODS","autumn","aim","days","spring","summer"],"language":"en"},

However, although analysis of deep next-generation sequencing data allows us to identity potential pathogens, the entire analytical procedure requires competency in the bioinformatics domain, which includes implementing proper software packages and preparing prerequisite databases.

Results: This manuscript presents a pipeline, drVM (detect and reconstruct known viral genomes from metagenomes), for rapid viral read identification, genus-level read partition, read normalization, de novo assembly, sequence annotation, and coverage profiling. The first two procedures and sequence annotation rely on known viral genomes as a reference database. drVM was validated via the analysis of over 300 sequencing runs generated by Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms to provide complete viral genome assemblies for a variety of virus types including DNA viruses, RNA viruses, and retroviruses. drVM is available for free download at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sb2nhri/files/drVM/ and is also assembled as a Docker container, an Amazon machine image, and a virtual machine to facilitate seamless deployment. Conclusions: drVM was compared with other viral detection tools to demonstrate its merits in terms of viral genome completeness and reduced computation time.

The antileishmanial activity of 3,5,7,3\u2019,4\u2019-pentahydroxyflavonol (quercetin) derivatives is partly attributed to the position and pKa of phenolic or catechol hydroxyl groups. Therefore, to optimize their leishmanicidal effect, the structural features of quercetin and its derivatives were improved by acylation or alkylation of hydroxyl groups and changing their pKa and consequently their activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, during a regioselective method, quercetin derivatives were synthesized. The structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by mass, IR, (1)H-, and (13)C-NMR spectral data. The antileishmanial activities of compounds 1\u20136 were compared with glucantime as the standard drug against promastigotes of Leishmania major using standard cell-based leishmanicidal assay. RESULTS: In this study, during a regioselective method, two 7-O-quercetin derivatives (5 and 6), and three quercetin acetate derivatives (2, 3, and 4) were synthesized. In detail, the IC(50) values found against L. major were (1) 2.5 \u00B1 0.92; (2) 2.85 \u00B1 0.99; (3) 15.5 \u00B1 1.95; (4) 13.5 \u00B1 3.5; (5) 2.6 \u00B1 0.57; and (6) 1.3 \u00B1 0.35 \u03BCM while IC(50) value of glucantime as the standard drug was 88.5 \u00B1 9.47 \u03BCM. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed an effective antileishmanial activity of quercetin semisynthetic compounds (1\u20136) against in vitro promastigotes of L. major. Among them, quercetin analogs with more lipophilic and iron-chelating activity showed more antiparasite activity.","publish_time":"2018-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohajeri, Maryam; Saghaei, Lotfollah; Ghanadian, Mustafa; Saberi, Sedighe; Pestechian, Nader; Ostadhusseini, Ehsan","journal":"Adv Biomed Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5952540.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5952540/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-quercetin derivatives","quercetin acetate derivatives","quercetin analogs","effective antileishmanial activity of quercetin semisynthetic compounds","structural features of quercetin","antileishmanial activities of compounds","structures of synthesized compounds","standard drug","antiparasite activity","antileishmanial effects","promastigotes of Leishmania major","iron-chelating activity","Natural-derived compounds","present study","regioselective method","\u03BCM","catechol hydroxyl groups","alkylation of hydroxyl groups","standard cell-based leishmanicidal assay","pKa of phenolic","leishmanicidal effect","value of glucantime","infectious parasitic disease","leishmaniasis","valuable source of new pharmaceuticals","position","acylation","C-NMR spectral data","mass","MATERIALS","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","values","pentahydroxyflavonol","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We have previously demonstrated in the MIA mouse model that maternal administration of H(2) attenuates oxidative damage and neuroinflammation, including induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglial activation, in the fetal brain. Short-term memory, sociability and social novelty, and sensorimotor gating were evaluated using the Y-maze, three-chamber, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) tests, respectively, at postnatal 3 or 4 weeks. The number of neurons and oligodendrocytes was also analyzed at postnatal 5 weeks by immunohistochemical analysis. Offspring of the LPS-exposed dams showed deficits in short-term memory and social interaction, following neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex. Maternal H(2) administration markedly attenuated these LPS-induced abnormalities. Moreover, we evaluated the effect of H(2) on LPS-induced astrocytic activation, both in vivo and in vitro. The number of activated astrocytes with hypertrophic morphology was increased in LPS-exposed offspring, but decreased in the offspring of H(2)-administered dams. In primary cultured astrocytes, LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines were attenuated by H(2) administration. Overall, these findings indicate that maternal H(2) administration exerts neuroprotective effects and ameliorates MIA-induced neurodevelopmental deficits of offspring later in life.","publish_time":"2018-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imai, Kenji; Kotani, Tomomi; Tsuda, Hiroyuki; Nakano, Tomoko; Ushida, Takafumi; Iwase, Akira; Nagai, Taku; Toyokuni, Shinya; Suzumura, Akio; Kikkawa, Fumitaka","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d603d8aa5b328d708683d754f224c1f9d170fc64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6003913.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6003913/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MIA","Maternal H"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Maternal H","offspring of H","maternal administration of H","effect of H","LPS-exposed offspring","LPS-induced abnormalities","LPS-exposed dams","maternal immune activation","induced pro-inflammatory cytokines","neurodevelopmental deficits of offspring","effect of maternal molecular hydrogen","Short-term memory","microglial activation","MIA mouse model","astrocytic activation","weeks","number of activated astrocytes","social interaction","social novelty","administered dams","number of neurons","primary cultured astrocytes","neuroinflammation","oligodendrocytic loss","hypertrophic morphology","chamber","sociability","sensorimotor gating","long-term outcomes","oxidative damage","present study","prepulse inhibition","PPI","amygdala","tests","neuroprotective effects","lipopolysaccharide","Y-maze","cortex","fetal brain","oligodendrocytes","immunohistochemical analysis","life","aim","findings"],"language":"en"},

We reported a slight modulation of type II IFN in PBMC exposed to Asian strain, but not to African strain, and a complete lack of type I and III IFN induction by both strains, suggesting the ability of ZIKV to evade the IFN system not only inhibiting the antiviral IFN response but also IFN production. Moreover, we highlighted a polyfunctional immune activation only in PBMC exposed to Asian strain, due to the induction of an inflammatory profile (IL-6, IL-8) and of a Th9 (IL-9) response.

Internet search query data have been identified as a valuable source for the detection of emerging influenza epidemics. However, the selection of the search queries and the adoption of prediction methods are crucial challenges when it comes to improving predictions. The purpose of this study was to explore the application of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression model in merging search engine query data and traditional influenza data. METHODS: The official monthly reported number of influenza cases in Liaoning province in China was acquired from the China National Scientific Data Center for Public Health from January 2011 to December 2015. Based on Baidu Index, a publicly available search engine database, search queries potentially related to influenza over the corresponding period were identified. An SVM regression model was built to be used for predictions, and the choice of three parameters (C, \u03B3, \u03B5) in the SVM regression model was determined by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) during the model construction process. The model\u2019s performance was evaluated by the evaluation metrics including Root Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Percentage Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. RESULTS: In total, 17 search queries related to influenza were generated through the initial query selection approach and were adopted to construct the SVM regression model, including nine queries in the same month, three queries at a lag of one month, one query at a lag of two months and four queries at a lag of three months. The SVM model performed well when with the parameters (C = 2, \u03B3 = 0.005, \u025B = 0.0001), based on the ensemble data integrating the influenza surveillance data and Baidu search query data. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the feasibility of using internet search engine query data as the complementary data source for influenza surveillance and the efficiency of SVM regression model in tracking the influenza epidemics in Liaoning.","publish_time":"2018-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Feng; Guan, Peng; Wu, Wei; Huang, Desheng","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/539ebc16737a7d43b43c582f3b625050c2bff9a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6022725.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6022725/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozkx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SVM","Baidu"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["search queries","influenza surveillance data","SVM model","traditional influenza data","Baidu search query data","Internet search query data","internet search engine query data","merging search engine query data","ensemble data","efficiency of SVM regression model","complementary data source","detection of emerging influenza epidemics","available search engine database","China National Scientific Data Center","model construction process","lag","Square Error","initial query selection approach","Square Percentage Error","official monthly reported number of influenza cases","Absolute Percentage Error","Root","parameters","months","RESULTS","predictions","economic challenges","valuable source","crucial challenges","Liaoning province","Baidu Index","adoption of prediction methods","feasibility","Support Vector Machine","evaluation metrics","Public Health","LOOCV","application","BACKGROUND","choice","total","model\u2019s performance","cross-validation","study","CONCLUSIONS","corresponding period","purpose"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A literature search was conducted for relevant studies published before May 30, 2016. Studies reporting on CMV infection in immunocompetent patients in ICUs and containing 2 \u00D7 2 tables on CMV results and all-cause mortality were included. RESULTS: Eighteen studies involving 2398 immunocompetent patients admitted to ICUs were included in the meta-analysis. The overall rate of CMV infection was 27% (95%CI 22\u201334%, I(2) = 89%, n = 2398) and the CMV reactivation was 31% (95%CI 24\u201339%, I(2) = 74%, n = 666). The odds ratio (OR) for all-cause mortality among patients with CMV infection, compared with those without infection, was 2.16 (95%CI 1.70\u20132.74, I(2) = 10%, n = 2239). Moreover, upon exclusion of studies in which antiviral treatment was possibly or definitely provided to some patients, the association of mortality rate with CMV infection was also statistically significant (OR: 1.69, 95%CI 1.01\u20132.83, I(2) = 37%, n = 912,). For CMV seropositive patients, the OR for mortality in patients with CMV reactivation as compared with patients without CMV reactivation was 1.72 (95%CI 1.04\u20132.85, I(2) = 29%, n = 664). Patients with CMV infection required significantly longer mechanical ventilation (mean difference (MD): 9 days (95% CI 5\u201314, I(2) = 81%, n = 875)) and longer duration of ICU stay (MD: 12 days (95% CI 7\u201317, I(2) = 70%, n = 949)) than patients without CMV infection. When analysis was limited to detection in blood, CMV infection without antiviral drug treatment or reactivation was not significantly associated with higher mortality (OR: 1.69, 95%CI 0.81\u20133.54, I(2) = 52%, n = 722; OR: 1.49, I(2) = 63%, n = 469). CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients without immunosuppression admitted to ICUs show a high rate of CMV infection. CMV infection during the natural unaltered course or reactivation in critically ill patients is associated with increased mortality, but have no effect on mortality when CMV in blood. More studies are needed to clarify the impact of CMV infection on clinical outcomes in those patients.

Here we employed the mouse lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) model, and found that IDO is necessary to achieve the effect of human umbilical cord-derived MSC (hUC-MSC)-based treatment on ALI. Notably, when IDO was deleted or inhibited, the expression of TSG-6 was decreased. This specific IDO-mediated regulation of TSG-6 expression was found to be exerted through its metabolite, kynurenic acid (KYNA), as inhibition of KYNA production led to decreased TSG-6 expression. Importantly, KYNA pretreatment of human MSCs enhanced their therapeutic effect on ALI. Mechanistically, KYNA activates aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which directly binds to the TSG-6 promoter to enhance TSG-6 expression. Therefore, our study has uncovered a novel link between IDO and TSG-6, and demonstrates that a metabolite of IDO controls the TSG-6-mediated anti-inflammatory therapeutic effects of human MSCs.","publish_time":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Guan; Cao, Kai; Liu, Keli; Xue, Yueqing; Roberts, Arthur I.; Li, Fengying; Han, Yanyan; Rabson, Arnold B.; Wang, Ying; Shi, Yufang","journal":"Cell Death Differ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4912244177d45c6835a5bf2208a03d69a0b4bbc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6030103.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6030103/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzEwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IDO","KYNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of TSG","decreased TSG","metabolite of IDO","specific IDO-mediated regulation of TSG","ALI","KYNA pretreatment of human MSCs","anti-inflammatory therapeutic effects of human MSCs","inhibition of KYNA production","effect of human umbilical cord-derived MSC","hUC-MSC","key immunosuppressive factors","acute lung injury","LPS","model","various immune disorders","TNF-stimulated gene","aryl hydrocarbon receptor","AhR","based treatment","indoleamine","dioxygenase","novel link","kynurenic acid","Mesenchymal stem cells","promoter","mouse lipopolysaccharide","necessity","study"],"language":"en"},

DCs functional plasticity allows shaping the outcome of immune responses to achieve the required type of immunity. Therefore, the choice of adjuvants to guide and sustain DCs maturation, the design of multifaceted vehicles, and the choice of surface molecules to specifically target DCs represent the key issues currently explored in both preclinical and clinical settings.

While much research relies upon viruses grown in cultured immortalized cells, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3) evolves in culture. Cultured viruses differ in their properties compared to clinical strains. We present a genome-wide survey of HPIV-3 adaptations to culture using metagenomic next-generation sequencing of matched pairs of clinical samples and primary culture isolates (zero passage virus). Nonsynonymous changes arose during primary viral isolation, almost entirely in the genes encoding the two surface glycoproteins\u2014the receptor binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or the fusion protein (F). We recovered genomes from 95 HPIV-3 primary culture isolates and 23 HPIV-3 strains directly from clinical samples. HN mutations arising during primary viral isolation resulted in substitutions at HN\u2019s dimerization/F-interaction site, a site critical for activation of viral fusion. Alterations in HN dimer interface residues known to favor infection in culture occurred within 4 days (H552 and N556). A novel cluster of residues at a different face of the HN dimer interface emerged (P241 and R242) and imply a role in HPIV-3-mediated fusion. Functional characterization of these culture-associated HN mutations in a clinical isolate background revealed acquisition of the fusogenic phenotype associated with cultured HPIV-3; the HN-F complex showed enhanced fusion and decreased receptor-cleaving activity. These results utilize a method for identifying genome-wide changes associated with brief adaptation to culture to highlight the notion that even brief exposure to immortalized cells may affect key viral properties and underscore the balance of features of the HN-F complex required for fitness by circulating viruses.","publish_time":"2018-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Iketani, Sho; Shean, Ryan C.; Ferren, Marion; Makhsous, Negar; Aquino, Dolly B.; des Georges, Amedee; Rima, Bert; Mathieu, Cyrille; Porotto, Matteo; Moscona, Anne; Greninger, Alexander L.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f8715a818bfd325bf4413d3c07003d7ce7b6f7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6030562.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6030562/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzEwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["culture-associated HN mutations","cultured HPIV","HN-F complex","primary culture isolates","Cultured viruses","primary viral isolation","HN dimer interface residues","activation of viral fusion","fusion protein","Human parainfluenza viruses","clinical strains","genome-wide survey of HPIV","enhanced fusion","mediated fusion","cultured immortalized cells","F-interaction site","key viral properties","clinical isolate background","genome-wide changes","generation sequencing of matched pairs of clinical samples","site critical","brief exposure","brief adaptation","Nonsynonymous changes","passage virus","receptor binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase","large burden of human respiratory illness","novel cluster of residues","decreased receptor-cleaving activity","HN\u2019s dimerization","different face","substitutions","surface glycoproteins","fusogenic phenotype","acquisition","metagenomic","notion","infection","adaptations","balance of features","R242","days","method","P241","Alterations","fitness","Functional characterization","genes","role","H552","N556","results","research","genomes"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the present retrospective study was to develop a mortality prediction model for TDL patients who require mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Data from consecutive TDL patients who had received mechanical ventilation at a single university-affiliated tertiary care hospital in Korea were reviewed. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors predicting intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. A TDL on mechanical Ventilation (TDL-Vent) score was calculated by assigning points to variables according to \u03B2 coefficient values. RESULTS: Data from 125 patients were reviewed. A total of 36 patients (29%) died during ICU admission. On the basis of multivariate analysis, the following factors were included in the TDL-Vent score: age \u226565 years, vasopressor use, and arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio \u003C180. In a second regression model, a modified score was then calculated by adding brain natriuretic peptide. For TDL-Vent scores 0 to 3, the 60-day mortality rates were 11%, 27%, 30%, and 77%, respectively (p\u003C0.001). For modified TDL-Vent scores 0 to \u22653, the 60-day mortality rates were 0%, 21%, 33%, and 57%, respectively (p=0.001). For both the TDL-Vent score and the modified TDL-Vent score, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were larger than that of other illness severity scores.

Our study reveals a general mechanism of target cell recognition by macrophages, which is the key for the removal of unwanted cells by PrCR in physiological and pathophysiological processes.","publish_time":"2018-08-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Mingye; Marjon, Kristopher D.; Zhu, Fangfang; Weissman-Tsukamoto, Rachel; Levett, Aaron; Sullivan, Katie; Kao, Kevin S.; Markovic, Maxim; Bump, Paul A.; Jackson, Hannah M.; Choi, Timothy S.; Chen, Jing; Banuelos, Allison M.; Liu, Jie; Gip, Phung; Cheng, Lei; Wang, Denong; Weissman, Irving L.","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c16e6d3922d2b800f5f3e2dec0e51b9f7700898.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0df659d4611fe09f4fa6ef2c22ec087985182ccb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6086865.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6086865/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cancer cells","removal of unwanted cells","recognition of appropriate target cells","hematopoietic stem cells","macrophages","successful PrCR","clearance of unwanted","cancer immunosurveillance","general mechanism of target cell recognition","programmed cell removal","CRT-binding sites","critical step","aging neutrophils","secreted calreticulin","prognosis of patients","process essential","models of tissue turnover","availability","detection","key","pathophysiological processes","various malignancies","study","molecular mechanisms","asialoglycans"],"language":"en"},

Exemplified by the common vampire bat, we demonstrate the use of metabarcoding to infer predator population structure alongside diet assessments. Growing populations of common vampire bats impact human, livestock and wildlife health in Latin America through transmission of pathogens, such as lethal rabies viruses. Techniques to determine large\u2010scale variation in vampire bat diet and bat population structure would empower locality\u2010 and species\u2010specific projections of disease transmission risks.

Using bloodmeal and faecal samples from common vampire bats from coastal, Andean and Amazonian regions of Peru, we showcase metabarcoding as a scalable tool to assess vampire bat population structure and feeding preferences. Dietary metabarcoding was highly effective, detecting vertebrate prey in 93.2% of the samples. Bats predominantly preyed on domestic animals, but fed on tapirs at one Amazonian site. In addition, we identified arthropods in 9.3% of samples, likely reflecting consumption of ectoparasites. Using the same data, we document mitochondrial geographic population structure in the common vampire bat in Peru. Such simultaneous inference of vampire bat diet and population structure can enable new insights into the interplay between vampire bat ecology and disease transmission risks.

The goal of these training programs is to inculcate in physicians the expected level of skill in patient care. After the initiation of such programs in the USA, Europe, and Japan, studies were conducted in Taiwan to investigate relevant training methods, and a training system was established in 2003. Beginning with 3-month programs, followed by 6-month programs, the programs were constantly modified and enhanced by the establishment of the 1-year training program in 2011. This year was the transition period from the 6-month programs to the 1-year programs. METHODS: We used a 50-item multiple choice question (MCQ) test and six 10-min stations for objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), which was composed of four stations relating to standardized patients and two stations concerning the clinical skill evaluation, to evaluate the learning results of the trainees. The trainees were divided into four groups according to the training program. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the performance of the 6 months and 1-year groups.

Ease of transmission has allowed the virus to spread worldwide with varying degrees of virulence depending upon the virus strain and host species. The emergence of new virulent genotypes from global epizootics, and the year-to-year genomic changes in low and high virulence APMV-1 imply that distinct genotypes of APMV-1 are simultaneously evolving at different geographic locations across the globe. This vast genomic diversity may be favoured by large variety of avian species susceptibility to APMV-1 infection, and by the availability of highly mobile wild birds. It has long been considered that waterfowls are not sensitive to APMV-1 and are unable to show any clinical signs, however, outbreaks from the 90\u2032s contradict these concepts. The APMV-1 isolates are increasingly reported from the waterfowl. Waterfowl have strong innate immune responses, which minimize the impact of virus infection, however, are unable to prevent the viral shedding. Numerous APMV-1 are carried by domestic waterfowl intermingling with terrestrial poultry. Therefore, commercial ducks and geese should be vaccinated against APMV-1 to minimize the virus shedding and for the prevention the transmission. Genetic diversity within APMV-1 demonstrates the need for continual monitoring of viral evolution and periodic updates of vaccine seed-strains to achieve efficient control and eradication of APMV-1 in waterfowls.

Recent studies have shown that miR-451 regulates downstream molecules including AMPK/CAB39/MARK and mTOR to determine the balance between rapid proliferation and invasion in response to metabolic stress in the harsh tumor microenvironment. Surgical removal of the main tumor is inevitably followed by recurrence of the tumor due to inaccessibility of dispersed tumor cells in normal brain tissue. In order to address this complex process of cell proliferation and invasion and its response to conventional treatment, we propose a mathematical model that analyzes the intracellular dynamics of the miR-451-AMPK- mTOR-cell cycle signaling pathway within a cell. The model identifies a key mechanism underlying the molecular switches between proliferative phase and migratory phase in response to metabolic stress in response to fluctuating glucose levels. We show how up- or down-regulation of components in these pathways affects the key cellular decision to infiltrate or proliferate in a complex microenvironment in the absence and presence of time delays and stochastic noise. Glycosylated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain, contribute to the physical structure of the local brain microenvironment but also induce or inhibit glioma invasion by regulating the dynamics of the CSPG receptor LAR as well as the spatiotemporal activation status of resident astrocytes and tumor-associated microglia. Using a multi-scale mathematical model, we investigate a CSPG-induced switch between invasive and non-invasive tumors through the coordination of ECM-cell adhesion and dynamic changes in stromal cells. We show that the CSPG-rich microenvironment is associated with non-invasive tumor lesions through LAR-CSGAG binding while the absence of glycosylated CSPGs induce the critical glioma invasion. We illustrate how high molecular weight CSPGs can regulate the exodus of local reactive astrocytes from the main tumor lesion, leading to encapsulation of non-invasive tumor and inhibition of tumor invasion. These different CSPG conditions also change the spatial profiles of ramified and activated microglia. The complex distribution of CSPGs in the tumor microenvironment can determine the nonlinear invasion behaviors of glioma cells, which suggests the need for careful therapeutic strategies.","publish_time":"2018-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yangjin; Kang, Hyunji; Powathil, Gibin; Kim, Hyeongi; Trucu, Dumitru; Lee, Wanho; Lawler, Sean; Chaplain, Mark","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59c41eef8e1d079fc6d1de1cf07cd989c8456d1c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0a617f5467e92a9a638ee23204247128635e32aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6171904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6171904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSPG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibition of tumor invasion","harsh tumor microenvironment","non-invasive tumor lesions","encapsulation of non-invasive tumor","tumor-associated microglia","complex microenvironment","main tumor lesion","inaccessibility of dispersed tumor cells","local brain microenvironment","CSPG-rich microenvironment","critical glioma invasion","nonlinear invasion behaviors of glioma cells","absence of glycosylated CSPGs","complex distribution of CSPGs","stromal cells","cell adhesion","cell cycle","complex process of cell proliferation","individual cancer cells","CSPG receptor LAR","metabolic stress","non-invasive tumors","intracellular dynamics","AMPK- mTOR","high molecular weight CSPGs","normal brain tissue","CSPG-induced switch","miR","different CSPG conditions","aggressive type of primary brain cancer","multi-scale mathematical model","key cellular decision","migratory phase","proliferative phase","intracellular responses","exodus of local reactive astrocytes","molecular switches","coordination of ECM","rapid proliferation","key mechanism","activated microglia","cellular dispersion","LAR-CSGAG binding","therapeutic control of glioblastoma","careful therapeutic strategies","Glycosylated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans","spatiotemporal activation status of resident astrocytes","dynamic changes","external biochemical cues","spatial profiles of ramified","presence of time delays","surgery","pathways","CAB39","MARK","major component","balance","need","physical structure","migration patterns","extracellular matrix","downstream molecules","conventional treatment","stochastic noise","recurrence","glucose levels","Surgical removal","regulation of components","Recent studies","order"],"language":"en"},

MATERIAL/METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, OA model, and OA \u002B Alprostadil (2.5, 5, and 10 \u03BCg/kg, respectively) groups. The ARDS model was induced by femoral vein injection of OA, and alprostadil was administrated immediately. Lung injury was evaluated by lung wet-dry weight ratio (W/D) and histological analyses. Expressions of ACE, inflammatory mediators, apoptotic-related proteins, and proteins in the MAPKs and NF-\u03BAB signaling pathways were determined by Western blot or immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the OA model group had significantly increased W/D, lung injury score, and collagen deposition at 3 h after OA injection. However, alprostadil (10 \u03BCg/kg) treatment significantly reduced OA-induced elevation of these indicators. Additionally, OA-induced expression of TNF-\u03B1 and IL-1\u03B2 were suppressed by alprostadil. The OA-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF) \u03BAB p65 was also reduced by alprostadil. Furthermore, we found that Alprostadil had an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPKs. Alprostadil inhibited Bax but increased Bcl-2, indicating a suppressive role in apoptosis. Remarkably increased expression of ACE in the OA model group was observed, which was decreased by alprostadil. CONCLUSIONS: Alprostadil has a protective effect on ARDS induced by OA in rats, possibly through inhibiting apoptosis, suppressing the activation of MAPKs and NF-\u03BAB signaling pathways, and decreasing ACE protein expression. Therefore, the use of alprostadil in clinical ARDS treatment is promising.","publish_time":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Xiujuan; Li, Yingxiu; Choi, Yun Ho; Wang, Chongyang; Piao, Yihua; Ye, Jing; Jiang, Jingzhi; Li, Liangchang; Xu, Huixian; Cui, Qingsong; Yan, Guanghai; Jin, Minggen","journal":"Med Sci Monit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41199e837e1c706b7a8a1a8a0970856974235566.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6190919.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6190919/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OA   Alprostadil","ARDS","OA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OA injection","OA model group","mechanism of alprostadil","use of alprostadil","OA-induced expression of TNF","reduced OA-induced elevation","Alprostadil inhibited Bax","OA-induced activation of nuclear factor","ARDS model","femoral vein injection of OA","NF-\u03BAB","increased expression of ACE","increased W","control group","activation of MAPKs","clinical ARDS treatment","ACE protein expression","pathways","lung injury score","\u03BAB p65","increased Bcl","Expressions of ACE","p38 MAPKs","\u03BCg","Sprague-Dawley rats","protective effect","inhibitory effect","suppressive role","inhibiting apoptosis","lung wet-dry weight ratio","apoptotic-related proteins","collagen deposition","acute respiratory distress syndrome","inflammatory mediators","Western blot","oleic acid","phosphorylation of JNK","ERK1","METHODS","immunohistochemical staining","MATERIAL","study","histological analyses","CONCLUSIONS","indicators","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","groups"],"language":"en"},

The critical role of public health in the context of disease surveillance was recognized with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts. OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on the quality of data being transmitted in the context of electronic laboratory reporting to public health. This was conducted in context of Minnesota Electronic Disease Surveillance System (MEDSS), the public health information system for supporting infectious disease surveillance in Minnesota. Data Quality (DQ) dimensions by Strong et al., was chosen as the guiding framework for evaluation. METHODS: The process of assessing data exchange for electronic lab reporting and its impact was a mixed methods approach with qualitative data obtained through expert discussions and quantitative data obtained from queries of the MEDSS system. Interviews were conducted in an open-ended format from November 2017 through February 2018. Based on these discussions, two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified: onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing. This in turn comprised of ten critical steps and its impact on quality of data was identified through expert input. This was followed by analysis of data in MEDSS by various criteria identified by the informatics team. RESULTS: All DQ metrics (Intrinsic DQ, Contextual DQ, Representational DQ, and Accessibility DQ) were impacted in the data exchange process with varying influence on DQ dimensions. Some errors such as improper mapping in electronic health records (EHRs) and laboratory information systems had a cascading effect and can pass through technical filters and go undetected till use of data by epidemiologists. Some DQ dimensions such as accuracy, relevancy, value-added data and interpretability are more dependent on users at either end of the data exchange spectrum, the relevant clinical groups and the public health program professionals. The study revealed that data quality is dynamic and on-going oversight is a combined effort by MEDSS Informatics team and review by technical and public health program professionals. CONCLUSION: With increasing electronic reporting to public health, there is a need to understand the current processes for electronic exchange and their impact on quality of data. This study focused on electronic laboratory reporting to public health and analyzed both onboarding and internal data exchange processes. Insights gathered from this research can be applied to other public health reporting currently (e.g. immunizations) and will be valuable in planning for electronic case reporting in near future.","publish_time":"2018-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajamani, Sripriya; Kayser, Ann; Emerson, Emily; Solarz, Sarah","journal":"Online J Public Health Inform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/23e73664ec4374d13d3a5243006bec6f30f5cda4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6194099.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6194099/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Minnesota Electronic Disease Surveillance System","Data Quality","MEDSS Informatics"],"locations":["Minnesota"],"keyphrases":["electronic exchange of health data","quality of data","Data Quality","process of data exchange","qualitative data","value-added data","use of data","quantitative data","analysis of data","data exchange spectrum","public health reporting","internal data exchange processes","internal data exchange routing","electronic health records","electronic lab reporting","public health agencies","electronic case reporting","increasing electronic reporting","context of electronic laboratory reporting","public health information system","public health program professionals","high level categories of data exchange process","critical role of public health","DQ dimensions","impact","Intrinsic DQ","Representational DQ","Contextual DQ","DQ metrics","Accessibility DQ","context of Minnesota Electronic Disease Surveillance System","MEDSS system","context of disease surveillance","laboratory information systems","MEDSS Informatics team","infectious disease surveillance","onboarding","expert discussions","study objective","centralization of information technology services","technical filters","current processes","critical steps","expert input","interoperability efforts","mixed methods approach","review","relevant clinical groups","combined effort","trend","EHRs","on-going oversight","present national initiatives","relevancy","recommendations","varying influence","cascading effect","improper mapping","various criteria","layer of complexity","interpretability","planning","accuracy","queries","near future","BACKGROUND","users","need","ELR","immunizations","RESULTS","errors","epidemiologists","CONCLUSION","guiding framework","evaluation","Interviews","open-ended format","turn","OBJECTIVES","research","Insights"],"language":"en"},

Smartphone applications (apps) have the potential to enhance surveillance data transmission. METHODS: The Central African Republic (CAR) Ministry of Health and M\u00E9decins Sans Fronti\u00E8res (MSF) conducted a 15-week pilot project to test a disease surveillance app, Argus, for 20 conditions in 21 health centers in Mamb\u00E9r\u00E9 Kad\u00E9i district (MK 2016). Results were compared to the usual paper-based surveillance in MK the year prior (MK 2015) and simultaneously in an adjacent health district, Nana-Mamb\u00E9re (NM 2016). Wilcoxon rank sum and Kaplan-Meier analyses compared report completeness and timeliness; the cost of the app, and users\u2019 perceptions of its usability were assessed. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-one weekly reports sent by app identified 3403 cases and 63 deaths; 15 alerts identified 28 cases and 4 deaths. Median completeness (IQR) for MK 2016, 81% (81\u201386%), was significantly higher than in MK 2015 (31% (24\u201336%)), and NM 2016 (52% (48\u201357)) (p \u003C 0.01). Median timeliness (IQR) for MK 2016, 50% (39\u201357%) was also higher than in MK 2015, 19% (19\u201324%), and NM 2016 29% (24\u201336%) (p \u003C 0.01). Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis showed a significant progressive reduction in the time taken to transmit reports over the 15-week period (p \u003C 0.01). Users ranked the app\u2019s usability as greater than 4/5 on all dimensions. The total cost of the 15-week pilot project was US$40,575. It is estimated that to maintain the app in the 21 health facilities of MK will cost approximately US$18,800 in communication fees per year. CONCLUSIONS: The app-based data transmission system more than doubled the completeness and timeliness of disease surveillance reports. This simple, low-cost intervention may permit the early detection of disease outbreaks in similar low-resource settings elsewhere.","publish_time":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"El-Khatib, Ziad; Shah, Maya; Zallappa, Samuel N; Nabeth, Pierre; Guerra, Jos\u00E9; Manengu, Casimir T; Yao, Michel; Philibert, Aline; Massina, Lazare; Staiger, Claes-Philip; Mbailao, Raphael; Kouli, Jean-Pierre; Mboma, Hippolyte; Duc, Geraldine; Inagbe, Dago; Barry, Alpha Boubaca; Dumont, Thierry; Cavailler, Philippe; Quere, Michel; Willett, Brian; Reaiche, Souheil; de Ribaucourt, Herv\u00E9; Reeder, Bruce","journal":"Confl Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/751163b36576e3b25e90b10c33528efc89204313.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6199707.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6199707/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ministry of Health and M\u00E9decins Sans Fronti\u00E8res","Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease surveillance app","health facilities of MK","timeliness of disease surveillance reports","surveillance data transmission","NM","timely disease surveillance information","Ministry of Health","health centers","Median completeness","Median timeliness","app-based data transmission system","adjacent health district","week pilot project","usual paper-based surveillance","report completeness","week period","cases","weekly reports","deaths","IQR","total cost","Results","early detection of disease outbreaks","similar low-resource settings","Kaplan-Meier analyses","Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis","year prior","app\u2019s usability","Mamb\u00E9r\u00E9 Kad\u00E9i district","CAR","availability of complete","significant progressive reduction","Central African Republic","M\u00E9decins Sans Fronti\u00E8res","MSF","potential","conditions","Nana-Mamb\u00E9re","Wilcoxon rank sum","low-cost intervention","challenge","alerts","Argus","users\u2019 perceptions","apps","METHODS","communication fees","CONCLUSIONS","Smartphone applications","dimensions","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The development of an effective vaccine against Zika virus may be problematic because of the cross reactivity of the antibodies with other flaviviruses leading to antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Moreover, rapidly replicating positive strand RNA viruses, including Zika virus, generate large spectrum of mutant genomes (quasi species) every replication round, allowing rapid selection of variants resistant to drugs targeting virus-specific proteins. On the other hand, viruses are ultimate cellular parasites and rely on the host metabolism for every step of their life cycle, thus presenting an opportunity to manipulate host processes as an alternative approach to suppress virus replication and spread. Zika and other flaviviruses critically depend on the cellular secretory pathway, which transfers proteins and membranes from the ER through the Golgi to the plasma membrane, for virion assembly, maturation and release. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of interactions of Zika and similar arthropod-borne flaviviruses with the cellular secretory machinery with a special emphasis on virus-specific changes of the secretory pathway. Identification of the regulatory networks and effector proteins required to accommodate the trafficking of virions, which represent a highly unusual cargo for the secretory pathway, may open an attractive and virtually untapped reservoir of alternative targets for the development of superior anti-viral drugs.","publish_time":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sager, Garrett; Gabaglio, Samuel; Sztul, Elizabeth; Belov, George A.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7188ee8f88af646369d7db34c99658cc80206c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6213159.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213159/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["virus replication","virus-specific proteins","virus-specific changes","cellular secretory pathway","flaviviruses","rapid establishment of virus circulation","high human cost of Zika virus infections","cellular secretory machinery","effector proteins","ultimate cellular parasites","alternative approach","replication round","host metabolism","host processes","development of superior anti-viral drugs","rapid selection of variants resistant","untapped reservoir of alternative targets","positive strand RNA viruses","special emphasis","quasi species","novel areas","large spectrum of mutant genomes","urgent need","virion assembly","plasma membrane","United States","similar arthropod","current knowledge of interactions","effective vaccine","countermeasures","maturation","Golgi","step","opportunity","antibody-dependent enhancement of infection","regulatory networks","antibodies","cross reactivity","hand","membranes","life cycle","emerging threat","unusual cargo","release","Identification","trafficking of virions","review"],"language":"en"},

To maximize coding potential, RNA viruses often contain internally located stop codons that should also be prime targets for NMD. Using an agroinfiltration-based NMD assay in Nicotiana benthamiana, we identified two segments conferring NMD-resistance in the carmovirus Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) genome. The ribosome readthrough structure just downstream of the TCV p28 termination codon stabilized an NMD-sensitive reporter as did a frameshifting element from umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus. In addition, a 51-nt unstructured region (USR) at the beginning of the TCV 3\u2019 UTR increased NMD-resistance 3-fold when inserted into an unrelated NMD-sensitive 3\u2019 UTR. Several additional carmovirus 3\u2019 UTRs also conferred varying levels of NMD resistance depending on the construct despite no sequence similarity in the analogous region. Instead, these regions displayed a marked lack of RNA structure immediately following the NMD-targeted stop codon. NMD-resistance was only slightly reduced by conversion of 19 pyrimidines in the USR to purines, but resistance was abolished when a 2-nt mutation was introduced downstream of the USR that substantially increased the secondary structure in the USR through formation of a stable hairpin. The same 2-nt mutation also enhanced the NMD susceptibility of a subgenomic RNA expressed independently of the genomic RNA. The conserved lack of RNA structure among most carmoviruses at the 5\u2019 end of their 3\u2019 UTR could serve to enhance subgenomic RNA stability, which would increase expression of the encoded capsid protein that also functions as the RNA silencing suppressor. These results demonstrate that the TCV genome has features that are inherently NMD-resistant and these strategies could be widespread among RNA viruses and NMD-resistant host mRNAs with long 3\u2019 UTRs.","publish_time":"2018-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"May, Jared P.; Yuan, Xuefeng; Sawicki, Erika; Simon, Anne E.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3aff001f58d03faf2bea881dfd5a0ea5706695ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6277124.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6277124/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","NMD","TCV","USR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NMD susceptibility","UTR increased NMD-resistance","RNA viruses","NMD-sensitive reporter","unrelated NMD-sensitive","varying levels of NMD resistance","NMD-resistant host mRNAs","NMD-targeted stop codon","agroinfiltration-based NMD assay","marked lack of RNA structure","conserved lack of RNA structure","USR","subgenomic RNA stability","RNA silencing suppressor","host RNA control pathway","UTRs","TCV genome","nt mutation","secondary structure","TCV p28 termination codon","ribosome readthrough structure","nt unstructured region","premature termination codons","carmovirus Turnip crinkle virus","untranslated regions","additional carmovirus","analogous region","umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus","frameshifting element","aberrant transcripts","Nicotiana benthamiana","expression","formation","strategies","fold","sequence similarity","PTCs","construct","segments","carmoviruses","beginning","encoded capsid protein","Nonsense-mediated decay","pyrimidines","stable hairpin","coding potential","prime targets","conversion","purines","defective splicing","end","results"],"language":"en"},

The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple-sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches; 2 of the branches include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (\u002B) RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (\u2212) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from \u002BRNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas \u2212RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of \u002BRNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, in particular, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy.","publish_time":"2018-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wolf, Yuri I.; Kazlauskas, Darius; Iranzo, Jaime; Luc\u00EDa-Sanz, Adriana; Kuhn, Jens H.; Krupovic, Mart; Dolja, Valerian V.; Koonin, Eugene V.","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4be1c96386ee9f1750f185e5f790425215cc0075.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6282212.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6282212/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","positive-sense RNA viruses","RNA virus RdRps","RNA virus taxonomy","dsRNA viruses","global RNA virome","Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution","distinct RNA helicases","double-stranded RNA","diverse viruses","replication of larger RNA genomes","RdRp tree","virus genome expression","horizontal virus transfer","virus-host interactions","RdRp phylogenetic tree construction","major branches","resulting tree","tree topology","universal gene","Subsequent evolution","eukaryotic virome","negative-sense","detailed phylogenomic reconstruction","extensive gene module exchange","independent occasions","Phylogenomic analysis","mix of positive","independent capture of additional genes","refinement","thorough reevaluation","enormous diversity","underlying multiple-sequence alignments","animals","single jelly","related hosts","common ancestors","iterative computational procedure","scaffold","network of evolutionary relationships","capsid protein","plants","present results","recent advances of metaviromics"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we will reflect on the potential added value of recent advances in technology and a better molecular understanding of necrosis and inflammation for improving diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients.

In the absence of systemic immunodeficiency, decision of NTM lung disease treatment must relies on a careful risk/benefit assessment, given the requirement of long-term administration of multidrug therapies supported by limited evidence. The primary objective was to identify the factors associated with anti-NTM treatment initiation. Clinical and radiological outcome upon treatment were studied. METHODS: This retrospective, single center study (2013\u20132016, 45 months) addressed the criteria supporting treatment decision among adults with NTM lung disease without systemic immunodeficiency at our institution, with the assigned goal to harmonize the practice. All patients matched the current international definitions of NTM lung disease according to the American Thoracic Society criteria. Factors associated with anti-NTM treatment were investigated by conditional logistic regression. Clinical and radiological outcomes of treated and untreated NTM-disease cases were examined. Mortality rate was assessed. An expert radiologist conducted a blinded computed tomography (CT)-scan review of the treated and untreated patients. RESULTS: Among 51 cases of NTM lung diseases, 25 (49%) received anti-NTM treatment. In univariate analysis, a body mass index (BMI) \u003C 18 kg/m(2) (odds ratio (OR), 4.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2\u201315.2]; p = 0.042), hemoptysis (OR, 11.8 [95% CI 1.35\u201312.9]; p = 0.026), excavation(s) (OR, 4.8 [95% CI 1.4\u201316.4], p = 0.012), prior anti-NTM treatment (OR, 5.65 [95% CI 1.06\u201329.9]; p = 0.042), Aspergillus spp. co-infection (OR, 6.3 [95% CI 1.8\u201322.2]; p = 0.004) were associated with treatment initiation. In multivariate analysis, Aspergillus spp. co-infection was the only independent determinant of treatment initiation (OR, 5.3 [95% CI 1.1\u201325.4]; p = 0.036). Twenty-one (81%) patients received \u22653 anti-NTM drugs. Median treatment duration and follow-up were 36.3 (interquartile range [IQR], 13.1\u201364.4) weeks and 17.1 (IQR, 8.7\u201327.1) months, respectively. Regarding radiological outcome, 85 CT-scans were reviewed, showing similar rates of regression or stabilization in treated and untreated patients. Overall mortality rate was not different in treated and untreated patients. CONCLUSION: The most relevant variable associated with anti-NTM treatment initiation was Aspergillus spp. co-infection. Radiological regression or stabilization of pulmonary lesions was not different between the treated and untreated patients.","publish_time":"2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Provoost, Judith; Valour, Florent; Gamondes, Delphine; Roux, Sandrine; Freymond, Nathalie; Perrot, Emilie; Souquet, Pierre-Jean; Kiakouama-Maleka, Lize; Chidiac, Christian; Lina, G\u00E9rard; Dumitrescu, Oana; S\u00E9n\u00E9chal, Agathe; Ader, Florence","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5fdb40f1b5bddf4ab24efaddedc40d441e3a130.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6295085.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6295085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Aspergillus"],"organizations":["American Thoracic Society"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anti-NTM treatment initiation","prior anti-NTM treatment","decision of NTM lung disease treatment","treatment decision","anti-NTM drugs","untreated NTM-disease cases","untreated patients","cases of NTM lung diseases","Median treatment duration","independent determinant of treatment initiation","current international definitions of NTM lung disease","Radiological regression","Aspergillus","co-infection","radiological outcomes","factors","months","IQR","absence of systemic immunodeficiency","conditional logistic regression","similar rates of regression","Overall mortality rate","CT-scans","univariate analysis","multivariate analysis","stabilization of pulmonary lesions","American Thoracic Society criteria","adults","individuals","blinded computed tomography","scan review","requirement of long-term administration of multidrug therapies","relevant variable","body mass index","follow-up","institution","Nontuberculous mycobacteria","benefit assessment","careful risk","single center study","retrospective","expert radiologist","chronic opportunistic infections","wide variety of underlying conditions","limited evidence","interquartile range","assigned goal","METHODS","BMI","BACKGROUND","practice","CONCLUSION","primary objective","excavation","confidence interval","RESULTS","odds ratio","weeks","hemoptysis"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We hypothesized that highly immunodeficient NSG mice would support the survival and maturation of O. volvulus and alteration of the host microenvironment through the addition of various human cells and tissues would further enhance the level of parasite maturation. NSG mice were humanized with: (1) umbilical cord derived CD34(\u002B) stem cells, (2) fetal derived liver, thymus and CD34(\u002B) stem cells or (3) primary human skeletal muscle cells. NSG and humanized NSG mice were infected with 100 O. volvulus infective larvae (L3) for 4 to 12 weeks. When necropsies of infected animals were performed, it was observed that parasites survived and developed throughout the infection time course. In each of the different humanized mouse models, worms matured from L3 to advanced fourth stage larvae, with both male and female organ development. In addition, worms increased in length by up to 4-fold. Serum and urine, collected from humanized mice for identification of potential biomarkers of infection, allowed for the identification of 10 O. volvulus-derived proteins found specifically in either the urine or the serum of the humanized O. volvulus-infected NSG mice.

A recent interest has grown to create antimicrobial copper touch surfaces, in order to counteract microbial spread in the healthcare environment. For the first time, five French long-term care facilities were at 50% fitted with copper alloys door handles and handrails. Related to the environmental bacterial contamination, 1400 samples were carried out on copper and control surfaces over three years after copper installation. In addition, some copper door handles were taken from the different facilities, and their specific activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was tested in vitro. In comparison to control surfaces, copper door handles and handrails revealed significantly lower contamination levels. This difference was observed in the five long-term care facilities and it persists through the three years of the study. High and extreme levels of bacterial contamination were less frequent on copper surfaces. Although, the antibacterial activity of copper surfaces against MRSA was lowered after three years of regular use, it was still significant as compared to inert control surfaces. Therefore, copper containing surfaces are promising actors in the non-spreading of environmental bacterial contamination in healthcare facilities.","publish_time":"2018-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Colin, Marius; Klingelschmitt, Flora; Charpentier, Emilie; Josse, J\u00E9r\u00F4me; Kanagaratnam, Lukshe; De Champs, Christophe; Gangloff, Sophie C.","journal":"Materials (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e87256ec4a079c0792106d6503eb78af24aebdb4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6317222.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6317222/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. aureus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibacterial activity of copper surfaces","copper door handles","copper installation","antimicrobial copper touch surfaces","inanimate surfaces","healthcare facilities","copper alloys door handles","inert control surfaces","healthcare environment","healthcare workers","extreme levels of bacterial contamination","different facilities","lower contamination levels","healthcare-associated infections","non-spreading of environmental bacterial contamination","French long-term care facilities","handrails","MRSA","years of regular use","specific activity","microorganisms\u2019 cross-transmission","order","promising actors","methicillin-resistant","patients","microbial spread","aureus","time","samples","addition","comparison","difference","study"],"language":"en"},

Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at increased risk for ARDS. We hypothesized that HSCT patients with ARDS would have a unique transcriptomic profile identifiable in peripheral blood compared to those that did not undergo HSCT. METHODS: We isolated RNA from banked peripheral blood samples from a biorepository of critically ill ICU patients. RNA-Seq was performed on 11 patients with ARDS (5 that had undergone HSCT and 6 that had not) and 12 patients with sepsis without ARDS (5 that that had undergone HCST and 7 that had not). RESULTS: We identified 687 differentially expressed genes between ARDS and ARDS-HSCT (adjusted p-value \u003C 0.01), including IFI44L, OAS3, LY6E, and SPATS2L that had increased expression in ARDS vs. ARDS-HSCT; these genes were not differentially expressed in sepsis vs sepsis-HSCT. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that many differentially expressed genes were related to response to type I interferon. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal significant differences in whole blood transcriptomic profiles of patients with non-HSCT ARDS compared to ARDS-HSCT patients and point toward different immune responses underlying ARDS and ARDS-HSCT that contribute to lung injury.

A 62-year-old woman, with regular physical activity and no history of respiratory disease or smoking, was hospitalized for moderate ARDS with bilateral pneumonitis. Fourteen days later, she was discharged from the intensive care unit and received respiratory physical therapy. One month later, she experienced exertional dyspnea. A regression of alveolar condensation with persistent sequelae at the pulmonary bases was noted. Three months later, the patient continued daily physical activity with satisfactory tolerance. A reduction in alveolar-capillary transfer, inappropriate hyperventilation upon exercise, and impairment of gas exchanges at maximal effort, suggestive of pulmonary shunt, were demonstrated. At the 6-month evaluation, the patient displayed exertional dyspnea with residual bilateral basal consolidations. Six months later, the dyspnea had ceased. The persistence of bilateral basal interstitial syndrome associated with bronchial dilatation and pleural-based consolidations was noted, as well as a stable impaired alveolar-capillary diffusing capacity. DISCUSSION: Upon discharge from intensive care, pulmonary follow-up should be proposed to ARDS survivors. Moreover, pulmonary function testing at rest and exercise is advised as soon as possible to evaluate the respiratory sequelae. This will help to limit the severity of complications through adapted exercise rehabilitation and then regular physical activity.","publish_time":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Godeau, Elise; Debeaumont, David; Artaud-Macari, Elise; Lagache, Laurie; Bouar, Gurvan Le; Coquart, J\u00E9r\u00E9my","journal":"Case Rep Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2af9fe633f4839d908785d15bac5c5233a53aca0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6431389.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6431389/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["regular physical activity","respiratory physical therapy","respiratory sequelae","pulmonary follow-up","pulmonary bases","exertional dyspnea","history of respiratory disease","alveolar-capillary transfer","residual bilateral basal consolidations","patient","acute respiratory distress syndrome","suggestive of pulmonary shunt","bilateral pneumonitis","pulmonary function testing","moderate ARDS","ARDS survivors","months","persistence of bilateral basal interstitial syndrome","adapted exercise rehabilitation","intensive care unit","regression of alveolar condensation","stable impaired alveolar-capillary diffusing capacity","year-old woman","persistent sequelae","clinical case","CASE PRESENTATION","month evaluation","pleural-based consolidations","bronchial dilatation","maximal effort","impairment of gas exchanges","inappropriate hyperventilation","discharge","smoking","severity of complications","rest","satisfactory tolerance","DISCUSSION","reduction","days"],"language":"en"},

It is, therefore, particularly important to develop a universal vaccine against conserved proteins or conserved regions of the virus. In this study, we used N-terminal extracellular region of the influenza virus M2 protein (M2e) as the target antigen and constructed two optimized M2e DNA vaccines (p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e) with increased antigenic epitope density and enhanced antigen secretion. Both vaccines induced high M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in the vaccinated mice. These two vaccines also conferred protection against a lethal infection of homo-subtypic H1N1 virus, with p-tPA-p3M2e being the most effective. In addition, p-tPA-p3M2e also showed cross-protection against different subtypes of the influenza virus (H9N2, H6N6, and H10N8) at varying rates (80%, 40%, and 20%, respectively). After passive immunization, M2e DNA vaccine-induced antibodies in the sera provided complete protection against homologous virus challenge. An analysis of the mechanism underlying this immunization-mediated protection indicates that M2e-specific IgG and T-cell immune responses may play critical roles in the prevention of infection and viral clearance. Taken together, our results indicate that this optimized M2e DNA vaccine is a promising candidate for the development of a universal, broad-spectrum influenza virus vaccine.","publish_time":"2019-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yao, Yanfeng; Wang, Huadong; Chen, Jianjun; Shao, Zhiyong; He, Bin; Chen, Jie; Lan, Jiaming; Chen, Quanjiao; Chen, Ze","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/766f315970750baecd98b7fcc1a0ba8d7368d1cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6455129.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6455129/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p-p3M2e","cross-protection","optimized M2e DNA vaccines","broad-spectrum influenza virus vaccine","complete protection","p-tPA","M2e-specific IgG","M2e DNA vaccine-induced antibodies","universal vaccine","influenza virus M2 protein","Current influenza vaccines","immunization-mediated protection","high M2e-specific humoral","hemagglutinin strain-specific protection","subtypic H1N1 virus","homologous virus challenge","cellular immune responses","T-cell immune responses","conserved proteins","prevention of infection","target antigen","conserved regions","passive immunization","lethal infection of homo","enhanced antigen secretion","increased antigenic epitope density","sera","critical roles","promising candidate","N-terminal extracellular region","different subtypes","development","H6N6","H9N2","H10N8","vaccinated mice","mechanism","viral clearance","divergent strains","results","addition","varying rates","study","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Dysregulation of USP9X has been linked to cancers and X-linked intellectual disability. Here, we report the crystal structure of the USP9X catalytic domain at 2.5-\u00C5 resolution. The structure reveals a canonical USP-fold comprised of fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains, as well as an unusual \u03B2-hairpin insertion. The catalytic triad of USP9X is aligned in an active configuration. USP9X is exclusively active against ubiquitin (Ub) but not Ub-like modifiers. Cleavage assays with di-, tri-, and tetraUb chains show that the USP9X catalytic domain has a clear preference for K11-, followed by K63-, K48-, and K6-linked polyUb chains. Using a set of activity-based diUb and triUb probes (ABPs), we demonstrate that the USP9X catalytic domain has an exo-cleavage preference for K48- and endo-cleavage preference for K11-linked polyUb chains. The structure model and biochemical data suggest that the USP9X catalytic domain harbors three Ub binding sites, and a zinc finger in the fingers subdomain and the \u03B2-hairpin insertion both play important roles in polyUb chain processing and linkage specificity. Furthermore, unexpected labeling of a secondary, noncatalytic cysteine located on a blocking loop adjacent to the catalytic site by K11-diUb ABP implicates a previously unreported mechanism of polyUb chain recognition. The structural features of USP9X revealed in our study are critical for understanding its DUB activity. The new Ub-based ABPs form a set of valuable tools to understand polyUb chain processing by the cysteine protease class of DUBs.","publish_time":"2019-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paudel, Prajwal; Zhang, Qi; Leung, Charles; Greenberg, Harrison C.; Guo, Yusong; Chern, Yi-Hsuan; Dong, Aiping; Li, Yanjun; Vedadi, Masoud; Zhuang, Zhihao; Tong, Yufeng","journal":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d3facc82a83039b3871ebb8a299bcdb9700156f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6380762dca586738fd20d4b1c4bbdc3722a313aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6462090.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6462090/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ABP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["catalytic triad of USP9X","USP9X catalytic domain harbors","Dysregulation of USP9X","K11-linked polyUb chains","structural features of USP9X","catalytic site","polyUb chain processing","K6-linked polyUb chains","endo-cleavage preference","exo-cleavage preference","new Ub-based ABPs","unreported mechanism of polyUb chain recognition","based diUb","K11-diUb ABP","clear preference","Ub binding sites","K48","DUB activity","set of activity","Cleavage assays","tetraUb chains","crystal structure","structure model","unusual \u03B2-hairpin insertion","noncatalytic cysteine","fingers subdomain","active configuration","set of valuable tools","cysteine protease class of DUBs","important roles","blocking loop adjacent","zinc finger","biochemical data","triUb probes","linkage specificity","canonical USP-fold","palm","cancers","study","thumb subdomains","conserved deubiquitinase","multiple cellular processes","\u00C5 resolution","intellectual disability","K63","modifiers"],"language":"en"},

Modern pharmacological studies and clinical practices indicate that AR possesses various biological functions, including potent immunomodulation, antioxidant, anti-inflammation and antitumor activities. To date, more than 200 chemical constituents have been isolated and identified from AR. Among them, isoflavonoids, saponins and polysaccharides are the three main types of beneficial compounds responsible for its pharmacological activities and therapeutic efficacy. After ingestion of AR, the metabolism and biotransformation of the bioactive compounds were extensive in vivo. The isoflavonoids and saponins and their metabolites are the major type of constituents absorbed in plasma. The bioavailability barrier (BB), which is mainly composed of efflux transporters and conjugating enzymes, is expected to have a significant impact on the bioavailability of AR. This review summarizes studies on the phytochemistry, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics on AR. Additionally, the use of AR as a personalized medicine based on the BB is also discussed, which may provide beneficial information to achieve a better and more accurate therapeutic response of AR in clinical practice.","publish_time":"2019-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Zhenzhen; Lou, Yanmei; Kong, Muyan; Luo, Qing; Liu, Zhongqiu; Wu, Jinjun","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7a4eae5bc97a5dc97189e3faa40ef9a91bb3207.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6470777.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6470777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Astragali"],"organizations":["BB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of AR","ingestion of AR","accurate therapeutic response of AR","pharmacological activities","bioavailability of","saponins","BB","isoflavonoids","Modern pharmacological studies","clinical practices","bioactive compounds","antitumor activities","therapeutic efficacy","beneficial information","chemical constituents","bioavailability barrier","main types of beneficial compounds responsible","major type of constituents","potent immunomodulation","antioxidant","various biological functions","anti-inflammation","metabolites","metabolism","biotransformation","phytochemistry","polysaccharides","personalized medicine","traditional Chinese herbal medicines","efflux transporters","conjugating enzymes","pharmacokinetics","pharmacology","plasma","review","date","significant impact","Astragali radix"],"language":"en"},

To promote the study of HMPV, several groups have generated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing recombinant HMPV strains (HMPV(GFP)). However, the growing evidence has complicated the understanding of cell line specificity of HMPV, because it seems to vary notably among HMPV strains. In addition, unique A2b clade HMPV strains with a 180-nucleotide duplication in the G gene (HMPV A2b(180nt-dup) strains) have recently been detected. In this study, we re-evaluated and compared the cell line specificity of clinical isolates of HMPV strains, including the novel HMPV A2b(180nt-dup) strains, and six recombinant HMPV(GFP) strains, including the newly generated recombinant HMPV A2b(180nt-dup) strain, MG0256-EGFP. Our data demonstrate that VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells generally showed the highest infectivity with any clinical isolates and recombinant HMPV(GFP) strains. Other human-derived cell lines (BEAS-2B, A549, HEK293, MNT-1, and HeLa cells) showed certain levels of infectivity with HMPV, but these were significantly lower than those of VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells. Also, the infectivity in these suboptimal cell lines varied greatly among HMPV strains. The variations were not directly related to HMPV genotypes, cell lines used for isolation and propagation, specific genome mutations, or nucleotide duplications in the G gene. Thus, these variations in suboptimal cell lines are likely intrinsic to particular HMPV strains.","publish_time":"2019-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nao, Naganori; Sato, Ko; Yamagishi, Junya; Tahara, Maino; Nakatsu, Yuichiro; Seki, Fumio; Katoh, Hiroshi; Ohnuma, Aiko; Shirogane, Yuta; Hayashi, Masahiro; Suzuki, Tamio; Kikuta, Hideaki; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Takeda, Makoto","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/147b848766e7280950bd8ac4d1c02efb55e63ef3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6478314.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478314/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzYxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant HMPV strains","study of HMPV","particular HMPV strains","HMPV genotypes","HMPV replicates","novel HMPV A2b","generated recombinant HMPV A2b","unique A2b clade HMPV strains","cell line specificity of clinical isolates of HMPV strains","understanding of cell line specificity of HMPV","suboptimal cell lines","human-derived cell lines","limited number of cell lines","nt-dup","LLC-MK2 cells","highest infectivity","HeLa cells","G gene","VeroE6","variations","certain levels of infectivity","nucleotide duplications","Human metapneumovirus","isolation","specific genome mutations","notable etiological agent of acute respiratory infection","propagation","BEAS","MNT","groups","cytopathic effect","addition","green fluorescent protein","A549","humans","CPE","MG0256-EGFP","HEK293","growing evidence","data"],"language":"en"},

However, experiments with vesiculoviral particles pseudotyped with Bas-Congo glycoprotein suggested that BASV particles can enter cells from multiple animals, including humans. In 2015, genomes of two related viruses, Ekpoma virus 1 (EKV-1) and Ekpoma virus 2 (EKV-2), were detected in human sera in Nigeria. Isolates could not be obtained. Phylogenetic analyses led to the classification of BASV, EKV-1, and EKV-2 in the same genus, Tibrovirus, together with five biting midge-borne rhabdoviruses [i.e., Beatrice Hill virus (BHV), Bivens Arm virus (BAV), Coastal Plains virus (CPV), Sweetwater Branch virus (SWBV), and Tibrogargan virus (TIBV)] not known to infect humans. Using individual recombinant vesiculoviruses expressing the glycoproteins of all eight known tibroviruses and more than 75 cell lines representing different animal species, we demonstrate that the glycoproteins of all tibroviruses can mediate vesiculovirus particle entry into human, bat, nonhuman primate, cotton rat, boa constrictor, and Asian tiger mosquito cells. Using four of five isolated authentic tibroviruses (i.e., BAV, CPV, SWBV, and TIBV), our experiments indicate that many cell types may be partially resistant to tibrovirus replication after virion cell entry. Consequently, experimental data solely obtained from experiments using tibrovirus surrogate systems (e.g., vesiculoviral pseudotypes, recombinant vesiculoviruses) cannot be used to predict whether BASV, or any other tibrovirus, infects humans.","publish_time":"2019-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ca\u00EC, Y\u00EDngy\u00FAn; Y\u00FA, Shu\u01D0q\u00ECng; Jangra, Rohit K.; Postnikova, Elena N.; Wada, Jiro; Tesh, Robert B.; Whelan, Sean P.

Here we report a specific genomic signal that mediates the generation of a subset of RSV cbDVG species. Using a customized bioinformatics tool, we identified regions in the RSV genome frequently used to generate cbDVGs during infection. We then created a minigenome system to validate the function of one of these sequences and to determine if specific nucleotides were essential for cbDVG generation at that position. Further, we created a recombinant virus unable to produce a subset of cbDVGs due to mutations introduced in this sequence. The identified sequence was also found as a site for cbDVG generation during natural RSV infections, and common cbDVGs originated at this sequence were found among samples from various infected patients. These data demonstrate that sequences encoded in the viral genome determine the location of cbDVG formation and, therefore, the generation of cbDVGs is not a stochastic process. These findings open the possibility of genetically manipulating cbDVG formation to modulate infection outcome.","publish_time":"2019-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Yan; Kim, Eun Ji; Felt, S\u00E9bastien A.; Taylor, Louis J.; Agarwal, Divyansh; Grant, Gregory R.; L\u00F3pez, Carolina B.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fe53e5ca071be4ba98a8366548192fc00d35333b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6504078.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6504078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cbDVG generation","generation of cbDVGs","cbDVG content","subset of RSV cbDVG species","subset of cbDVGs","location of cbDVG formation","RSV genome","common cbDVGs","infection outcome","identified sequence","natural RSV infections","sequences","host response","specific nucleotides","antiviral immune response","respiratory syncytial virus","recombinant virus unable","Defective viral genomes","specific genomic signal","primary initiators","regions","copy","order","site","samples","type","ability","various infected patients","customized bioinformatics tool","function","possibility","mechanism","position","mutations","stochastic process","minigenome system","findings","data"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we hypothesized that diffusion of inhaled anesthetics from airway lumen to smooth muscle would yield significant bronchodilation in vivo, and systemic recirculation would not be necessary to reduce lung resistance (R(L)) and elastance (E(L)) during sustained bronchoconstriction. To test this hypothesis, we designed a delivery system for precise timing of inhaled volatile anesthetics during the course of a positive pressure breath. We compared changes in R(L), E(L), and anatomic dead space (V(D)) in canines (N = 5) during pharmacologically induced bronchoconstriction with intravenous methacholine, and following treatments with: (1) targeted anesthetic delivery to V(D) and (2) continuous anesthetic delivery throughout inspiration. Both sevoflurane and isoflurane were used during each delivery regimen. Compared to continuous delivery, targeted delivery resulted in significantly lower doses of delivered anesthetic and decreased end-expiratory concentrations. However, we did not detect significant reductions in R(L) or E(L) for either anesthetic delivery regimen. This lack of response may have resulted from an insufficient dose of the anesthetic to cause bronchodilation, or from the preferential distribution of air flow with inhaled anesthetic delivery to less constricted, unobstructed regions of the lung, thereby enhancing airway heterogeneity and increasing apparent R(L) and E(L).","publish_time":"2018-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mondo\u00F1edo, Jarred R.; McNeil, John S.; Herrmann, Jacob; Simon, Brett A.; Kaczka, David W.","journal":"J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc15950cd55e71458c7bace7537bdf1ad9725058.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6516463.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6516463/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhaled anesthetic delivery","continuous anesthetic delivery","anesthetic delivery regimen","continuous delivery","targeted delivery","delivery system","lung resistance","apparent R","diffusion of inhaled anesthetics","precise timing of inhaled volatile anesthetics","significant bronchodilation","airway lumen","airway heterogeneity","significant reductions","induced bronchoconstriction","sustained bronchoconstriction","dilation of constricted airways","smooth muscle","course","preferential distribution of air flow","lower doses","decreased end-expiratory concentrations","anatomic dead space","unobstructed regions","intravenous methacholine","systemic recirculation","positive pressure breath","canines","insufficient dose","isoflurane","inspiration","treatments","hypothesis","elastance","lack of response","sevoflurane","study","changes"],"language":"en"},

For this reason, detecting influenza infection patterns is critical. However, as the epidemic spread of influenza occurs sporadically and rapidly, it is not easy to estimate the future variance of influenza virus infection. Furthermore, accumulating influenza related data is not easy, because the type of data that is associated with influenza is very limited. For these reasons, identifying useful data and building a prediction model with these data are necessary steps toward predicting if the number of patients will increase or decrease. On the Internet, numerous press releases are published every day that reflect currently pending issues. RESULTS: In this research, we collected Internet articles related to infectious diseases from the Centre for Health Protection (CHP), which is maintained the by Hong Kong Department of Health, to see if news text data could be used to predict the spread of influenza. In total, 7769 articles related to infectious diseases published from 2004 January to 2018 January were collected. We evaluated the predictive ability of article text data from the period of 2013\u20132018 for each of the weekly time horizons. The support vector machine (SVM) model was used for prediction in order to examine the use of information embedded in the web articles and detect the pattern of influenza spread variance. The prediction result using news text data with SVM exhibited a mean accuracy of 86.7 % on predicting whether weekly ILI patient ratio would increase or decrease, and a root mean square error of 0.611 on estimating the weekly ILI patient ratio. CONCLUSIONS: In order to remedy the problems of conventional data, using news articles can be a suitable choice, because they can help estimate if ILI patient ratio will increase or decrease as well as how many patients will be affected, as shown in the result of research. Thus, advancements in research on using news articles for influenza prediction should continue to be pursed, as the result showed acceptable performance as compared to existing influenza prediction researches.","publish_time":"2019-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Juhyeon; Ahn, Insung","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9fa99532407c6f68ffa719e321870586363c18a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6528302.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6528302/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Centre for Health Protection","Hong Kong Department of Health","SVM","ILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["accumulating influenza related data","pattern of influenza","news text data","epidemic spread of influenza","news articles","useful data","type of data","influenza infection patterns","existing influenza prediction researches","prediction result","prediction model","Internet articles","problems of conventional data","future variance of influenza virus infection","web articles","weekly ILI patient ratio","result of research","predictive ability of article text data","SVM","Health Protection","human health","infectious diseases","order","predicting","weekly time horizons","Hong Kong Department of Health","mean accuracy","number of patients","day","Centre","necessary steps","acceptable performance","numerous press releases","support vector machine","use of information","serious threat","CHP","suitable choice","period","advancements","square error","root","pending issues","reasons","total","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The virus is widely distributed throughout southeastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Disease management has proven difficult and there are no broadly licensed vaccines or therapeutics. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSV) expressing foreign glycoproteins (GP) have shown promise as experimental vaccines for several viral hemorrhagic fevers. Here, we developed and assessed a replication competent rVSV vector expressing the CCHFV glycoprotein precursor (GPC), which encodes CCHFV structural glycoproteins. This construct drives strong expression of CCHFV-GP, in vitro. Using these vectors, we vaccinated STAT-1 knock-out mice, an animal model for CCHFV. The vector was tolerated and 100% efficacious against challenge from a clinical strain of CCHFV. Anti-CCHFV-GP IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were observed in surviving animals. This study demonstrates that a rVSV expressing only the CCHFV-GP has the potential to serve as a replication competent vaccine platform against CCHF infections.","publish_time":"2019-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez, Sergio E.; Cross, Robert W.; Fenton, Karla A.; Bente, Dennis A.; Mire, Chad E.; Geisbert, Thomas W.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d8e134d93a4666285518b7916316a97dcc258788.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6533279.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6533279/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recombinant","CCHFV","CCHF"],"locations":["Europe","Middle East","Africa","Asia"],"keyphrases":["CCHFV structural glycoproteins","Anti-CCHFV-GP IgG","CCHFV glycoprotein precursor","clinical strain of CCHFV","strong expression of CCHFV","replication competent rVSV vector","life-threatening hemorrhagic syndrome","viral hemorrhagic fevers","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus","replication competent vaccine platform","experimental vaccines","foreign glycoproteins","licensed vaccines","animal model","animal host","neutralizing antibody titers","Middle East","CCHF infections","humans","mice","GPC","Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses","southeastern Europe","Africa","challenge","tick-borne bunyavirus","potential","surviving animals","STAT","Asia","knock","construct","Disease management","therapeutics","vectors","study"],"language":"en"},

This tRNA(Leu) isoacceptor is particularly rare in human cell lines derived from T-lymphocytes, the cells that are targeted by HIV-1. When UUA decoding is delayed, the frameshifting follows an alternative route, which maintains the Gag to Gag-Pol ratio constant. A second potential slippery site downstream of the first one is normally inefficient but can also support \u20131-frameshifting when altered by a compensatory resistance mutation in response to current antiviral drug therapy.

The APR can be identified and monitored with some laboratory tests, such as the concentration of several plasma proteins, the acute phase proteins (APPs). The APPs are components of the non-specific innate immune response, and their plasma concentration is proportional to the severity and/or the extent of tissue damage. The evaluation of health status of marine mammals is difficult because the classical clinical signs of illness used for human and domestic animals are difficult to recognize and understand. For this reason, in the past years, several efforts were done to identify laboratory markers of disease in these animals. The APPs have demonstrated their role as early markers of inflammation in veterinary medicine, thus several APPs were tested in marine mammals, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid-A (SAA), and Haptoglobin (Hp). However, the difficulty to extrapolate the knowledge about APPs in one species to another, the lack of specie-specific reagents, the absence of data about negative APPs have hampered their extent use in marine mammals. Herein, the state of art of APPs in marine mammals is reviewed, with particular attention to pre-analytical and analytical factors that should be taken into account in validation and interpretation of APPs assays. Moreover, the current application, potential utility and the future developments of APPs in marine mammals is highlighted and discussed.","publish_time":"2019-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gelain, Maria Elena; Bonsembiante, Federico","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/236bd666a76213bc131969e1d5b66e410fc1cd45.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6549532.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6549532/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["negative APPs","future developments of APPs","interpretation of APPs assays","evaluation of health status of marine mammals","plasma proteins","plasma concentration","acute phase proteins","acute phase response","extent of tissue damage","early markers of inflammation","laboratory markers of disease","analytical factors","extent use","domestic animals","laboratory tests","non-specific innate immune response","particular attention","classical clinical signs of illness","potential utility","absence of data","specific reagents","CRP","C-reactive protein","infection","components","veterinary medicine","serum amyloid","SAA","lack of specie","organism","neoplasia","efforts","trauma","validation","account","severity","role","current application","state of art","past years","complex reaction","knowledge","species","term","Haptoglobin","Hp","reason","stress","difficulty"],"language":"en"},

However, healthcare use after discharge from ICU has received only little attention by research. This study sets out to investigate the extent of ambulatory and stationary healthcare use among survivors of ARDS in Germany (multicenter DACAPO cohort) and to analyze predictors of stationary healthcare use. RESULTS: A total of 396 survivors of ARDS provided data at 1 year after discharge from ICU. Fifty percent of 1-year survivors were hospitalized for 48 days or longer after discharge from ICU, with 10% spending more than six out of 12 months in stationary care. The duration of hospitalization increased significantly by the length of the initial ICU stay. All participants reported at least one outpatient visit (including visits to general practitioners), and 50% contacted four or more different medical specialties within the first year after discharge from ICU. CONCLUSIONS: For most of the patients, the first year after ARDS is characterized by an extensive amount of healthcare utilization, especially with regard to stationary health care. These findings shed light on the substantial morbidity of patients after ARDS and contribute to a better understanding of the situation of patients following discharge from ICU.","publish_time":"2019-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brandstetter, Susanne; Dodoo-Schittko, Frank; Brandl, Magdalena; Blecha, Sebastian; Bein, Thomas; Apfelbacher, Christian","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dcfbf04c5bf819de0d261d15a1936288f578d416.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6570725.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6570725/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","ARDS"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["discharge","survivors of ARDS","year survivors","initial ICU","stationary care","predictors of stationary healthcare use","stationary health care","healthcare utilization","situation of patients","substantial morbidity of patients","intensive care unit","survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome","Germany","process","multicenter DACAPO cohort","regard","extent of ambulatory","outpatient visit","visits","light","better understanding","recovery","data","days","general practitioners","little attention","different medical specialties","findings","length","total","research","participants","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","months","percent","duration of hospitalization","study","CONCLUSIONS","spending"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we used ex vivo invasion assays and population genetic analyses to investigate the involvement of complement receptor 1 (CR1) in P. vivax invasion. First, we observed that P. vivax invasion of reticulocytes was consistently reduced when CR1 surface expression was reduced through enzymatic cleavage, in the presence of naturally low-CR1-expressing cells compared with high-CR1-expressing cells, and with the addition of soluble CR1, a known inhibitor of P. falciparum invasion. Immuno-precipitation experiments with P. vivax Reticulocyte Binding Proteins showed no evidence of complex formation. In addition, analysis of CR1 genetic data for worldwide human populations with different exposure to malaria parasites show significantly higher frequency of CR1 alleles associated with low receptor expression on the surface of RBCs and higher linkage disequilibrium in human populations exposed to P. vivax malaria compared with unexposed populations. These results are consistent with a positive selection of low-CR1-expressing alleles in vivax-endemic areas. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CR1 availability on the surface of RBCs modulates P. vivax invasion. The identification of new molecular interactions is crucial to guiding the rational development of new therapeutic interventions against vivax malaria.","publish_time":"2019-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prajapati, Surendra Kumar; Borlon, C\u00E9line; Rovira-Vallbona, Eduard; Gruszczyk, Jakub; Menant, Sebastien; Tham, Wai-Hong; Kattenberg, Johanna Helena; Villasis, Elizabeth; De Meulenaere, Katlijn; Gamboa, Dionicia; Vinetz, Joseph; Fujita, Ricardo; Xuan, Xa Nguyen; Urbano Ferreira, Marcelo; Ni\u00F1o, Carlos H.; Patarroyo, Manuel A.; Spanakos, Gregory; Kestens, Luc; Abbeele, Jan Van Den; Rosanas-Urgell, Anna","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6b7bfae68c5c25203f76616c028668feea39e8e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6586822.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6586822/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzczMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Reticulocyte Binding Proteins"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["low-CR1","vivax malaria","CR1 availability","high-CR1","CR1 surface expression","vivax invasion of reticulocytes","addition of soluble CR1","Plasmodium vivax parasites","higher frequency of CR1 alleles","vivax-endemic areas","analysis of CR1 genetic data","vivax Reticulocyte Binding Proteins","invasion assays","falciparum invasion","human populations","surface of RBCs","malaria parasites","reticulocyte cells","low receptor expression","unexposed populations","positive selection of low","population genetic analyses","higher linkage disequilibrium","involvement of complement receptor","identification of new molecular interactions","rational development of new therapeutic interventions","different exposure","known inhibitor of","Immuno-precipitation experiments","enzymatic cleavage","evidence of complex formation","presence","results","multistep process","study","findings"],"language":"en"},

Despite intense research, targeted sepsis therapies beyond antibiotics have remained elusive. The cornerstone of sepsis research is the development of animal models to mimic human bacterial infections and test novel pharmacologic targets. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) have served as an attractive, but expensive, animal to model human bacterial infections due to their nearly identical cardiopulmonary anatomy and physiology, as well as host response to infection. Several NHP species have provided substantial insight into sepsis-mediated inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, acute lung injury, and multi-organ failure. The use of NHPs has usually focused on translating therapies from early preclinical models to human clinical trials. However, despite successful sepsis interventions in NHP models, there are still no FDA-approved sepsis therapies. This review highlights major NHP models of bacterial sepsis and their relevance to clinical medicine.","publish_time":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Lingye; Welty-Wolf, Karen E.; Kraft, Bryan D.","journal":"Lab Anim (NY)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4041dbdf50df73b5c4dd4f9d11f74c7335c33564.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6613635.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6613635/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["targeted sepsis therapies","cornerstone of sepsis research","sepsis-mediated inflammation","successful sepsis interventions","FDA-approved sepsis therapies","review highlights major NHP models of bacterial sepsis","human bacterial infections","development of animal models","early preclinical models","human clinical trials","translating therapies","NHP species","disordered host response","systemic infection","intense research","clinical medicine","use of NHPs","acute lung injury","endothelial dysfunction","substantial insight","test novel pharmacologic targets","physiology","antibiotics","relevance","multi-organ failure","high morbidity","identical cardiopulmonary anatomy","mortality","Nonhuman primates"],"language":"en"},

Evolutionary adaptations would have been required to survive the elevated body temperatures during flight. Heat shock protein (HSP), highly conserved master regulators of cell stress, expression was examined across tissues and various cell lines in bats. Basal expression level of major HSPs (HSP70 and HSP90) is significantly higher in two different bat species compared to other mammals. This HSP expression could be a bat-unique, key factor to modulate cellular stress and death. Consequently, bat cells survive prolonged heat treatment, along with other stress stimuli, in a HSP-dependent manner, whereas other mammalian cells succumbed. This suggests HSP expression in bats could be an important adaption to intrinsic metabolic stresses like flight and therefore an important model to study stress resilience and longevity in general.

However, an unintended consequence is the potential for fugitive emissions during patient treatment, which may pose a risk factor in both clinical and homecare settings. Methods: The current study examined the potential for fugitive emissions, using albuterol sulphate as a tracer aerosol during high-flow therapy. A nasal cannula was connected to a head model or alternatively, a interface was connected to a tracheostomy tube in combination with a simulated adult and paediatric breathing profile. Two aerodynamic particle sizers (APS) recorded time-series aerosol concentrations and size distributions at two different distances relative to the simulated patient. Results: The results showed that the quantity and characteristics of the fugitive emissions were influenced by the interface type, patient type and supplemental gas-flow rate. There was a trend in the adult scenarios; as the flow rate increased, the fugitive emissions and the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol both decreased. The fugitive emissions were comparable when using the adult breathing profiles for the nasal cannula and tracheostomy interfaces; however, there was a noticeable distinction between the two interfaces when compared for the paediatric breathing profiles. The highest recorded aerosol concentration was 0.370 \u00B1 0.046 mg m(\u22123) from the tracheostomy interface during simulated paediatric breathing with a gas-flow rate of 20 L/min. The averaged MMAD across all combinations ranged from 1.248 to 1.793 \u00B5m by the APS at a distance of 0.8 m away from the patient interface. Conclusions: Overall, the results highlight the potential for secondary inhalation of fugitive emissions released during simulated aerosol treatment with concurrent high-flow therapy. The findings will help in developing policy and best practice for risk mitigation from fugitive emissions.","publish_time":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGrath, James A.; O\u2019Toole, Ciarra\u00ED; Bennett, Gavin; Joyce, Mary; Byrne, Miriam A.; MacLoughlin, Ronan","journal":"Pharmaceutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2269f102137c683d0a7871a9ea5110298bd3598c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6630289.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6630289/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APS","MMAD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["simulated aerosol treatment","secondary inhalation of fugitive emissions","simulated patient","patient interface","simulated paediatric breathing","simulated adult","patient treatment","potential","tracer aerosol","adult breathing profiles","patient type","interface type","paediatric breathing profiles","Results","supplemental gas-flow rate","concurrent high-flow therapy","tracheostomy interfaces","highest recorded aerosol concentration","time-series aerosol concentrations","adult scenarios","nasal cannula","tracheostomy tube","APS","treatment of respiratory diseases","risk mitigation","risk factor","averaged MMAD","aerodynamic particle sizers","mass median aerodynamic diameter","size distributions","best practice","different distances relative","albuterol sulphate","developing policy","current study","quantity","characteristics","Nebulised medical aerosols","homecare settings","head model","unintended consequence","drugs","Background","combinations","\u00B5m","findings","Methods","noticeable distinction","lungs","trend","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Thus far, research on picornaviruses has mainly focused on structural proteins such as VP1, whereas the non-structural protein 2B, which plays vital roles in the life cycle of the viruses and exhibits a viroporin or viroporin-like activity, has been overlooked. Viroporins are viral proteins containing at least one amphipathic \u03B1-helical structure, which oligomerizes to form transmembrane hydrophilic pores. In this review, we mainly summarize recent research data on the viroporin or viroporin-like activity of 2B proteins, which affects the biological function of the membrane, regulates cell death, and affects the host immune response. Considering these mechanisms, the potential application of the 2B protein as a candidate target for antiviral drug development is discussed, along with research challenges and prospects toward realizing a novel treatment strategy for picornavirus infections.","publish_time":"2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Zengbin; Zou, Zixiao; Jiang, Zeju; Huang, Xiaotian; Liu, Qiong","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6ea115f3fa7ea76715b04ee4a3f3a55add45397.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6630369.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6630369/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B proteins","picornavirus infections","viral proteins","structural proteins","research challenges","activity","Picornaviruses","clinical manifestations of infections","recent research data","non-structural protein","human health","economic losses","oligomerizes","serious impacts","candidate target","novel treatment strategy","gastroenteritis","myocarditis","meningitis","hepatitis","poliomyelitis","amphipathic \u03B1-helical structure","prospects","antiviral drug development","animal husbandry","respiratory symptoms","vital roles","cell death","life cycle","biological function","VP1","potential application","transmembrane hydrophilic pores","host immune response","chronic diseases","mechanisms","Viroporins","review"],"language":"en"},

The peptide candidate SPHLHTSSPWER, named SP, was fused to the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) structural protein and protective antigen VP2. In vitro, the expression of DC markers (CD80, CD83, CD86, DEC205, and MHCII) and some cytokines (IFN-\u03B3, IL-12, TNF-\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, and CXCLi1) by VP2-SP-stimulated DCs was significantly higher than that by DCs treated with the VP2-control peptide at 4 h (p \u003C 0.001). In addition, an oral vaccine targeting DCs was generated using chicken-borne Lactobacillus saerimneri M11 (L. sae M11) to deliver VP2 fused with SP. Anti-IBDV mucosal and humoral immune responses were induced efficiently via oral administration, resulting in higher protective efficacy in the VP2-SP group than the VP2 group. Therefore, chicken DC targeting of IBDV protective antigen VP2 delivered by L. sae provides effective immune protection in chicken.

Adaptive mutations could have contributed to the successful emergence of ZIKV as a global health threat to a nonimmune population. However, the causal relationships between the ZIKV genetic determinants, the pathogenesis and the rapid spread in Latin America and in the Caribbean remain widely unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterise three ZIKV isolates obtained from patient samples during the 2015/2016 Brazilian epidemics. METHODS: The ZIKV genomes of these strains were completely sequenced and in vitro infection kinetics experiments were carried out in cell lines and human primary cells. FINDINGS: Eight nonsynonymous substitutions throughout the viral genome of the three Brazilian isolates were identified. Infection kinetics experiments were carried out with mammalian cell lines A549, Huh7.5, Vero E6 and human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDCs) and insect cells (Aag2, C6/36 and AP61) and suggest that some of these mutations might be associated with distinct viral fitness. The clinical isolates also presented differences in their infectivity rates when compared to the well-established ZIKV strains (MR766 and PE243), especially in their abilities to infect mammalian cells.

Best examples of viral infections that have been proposed to modulate the induction and development of autoimmune diseases are the infections with enteric viruses such as Coxsackie B virus (CVB) and rotavirus, as well as influenza A viruses (IAV), and herpesviruses. Other viruses that have been studied in this context include, measles, mumps, and rubella. Epidemiological studies in humans and experimental studies in animal have shown that viral infections can induce or protect from autoimmunopathologies depending on several factors including genetic background, host-elicited immune responses, type of virus strain, viral load, and the onset time of infection. Still, data delineating the clear mechanistic interaction between the virus and the immune system to induce autoreactivity are scarce. Available data indicate that viral-induced autoimmunity can be activated through multiple mechanisms including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, bystander activation, and immortalization of infected B cells. Contrarily, the protective effects can be achieved via regulatory immune responses which lead to the suppression of autoimmune phenomena.

A DNA-launched rescue system initiates the transcription of viral genomic cDNA from eukaryotic promoter in transfected cells, generating homogenous RNA transcripts in vitro and thus enhancing virus rescue efficiency. As one of the hazardous pathogens to ducklings, the current knowledge of the pathogenesis of duck astrovirus type 1 (DAstV-1) is limited. The construction of a DNA-launched rescue system can help to accelerate the study of the virus pathogenesis. However, there is no report of such a system for DAstV-1. METHODS: In this study, a DNA-launched infectious clone of DAstV-1 was constructed from a cDNA plasmid, which contains a viral cDNA sequence flanked by hammerhead ribozyme (HamRz) and a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HdvRz) sequence at both terminals of the viral genome. A silent nucleotide mutation creating a Bgl II site in the ORF2 gene was made to distinguish the rescued virus (rDAstV-1) from the parental virus (pDAstV-1). Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and western blot were conducted for rescued virus identification in duck embryo fibroblast (DEF) cells pre-treated with trypsin. The growth characteristics of rDAstV-1 and pDAstV-1 in DEF cells and the tissue tropism in 2-day-old ducklings of rDAstV-1 and pDAstV-1 were determined. RESULTS: The infectious DAstV-1 was successfully rescued from baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and could propagate in DEF cells pre-treated with 1 \u03BCg/ml trypsin. Upon infection of DEF cells pre-treated with trypsin, DAstV-1 mRNA copies were identified after serial passaging, and the result showed that rDAstV-1 and pDAstV-1 shared similar replication kinetics. Animal experiment showed that the rDAstV-1 had an extensive tissue tropism, and the virus was capable of invading both the central and the peripheral immune organs in infected ducklings. CONCLUSIONS: An improved DNA-launched reverse genetics system for DAstV-1 was firstly constructed. Infectious virus recovered from BHK-21 cells could propagate in DEF cells pre-treated with trypsin. This is the first report of the successful in vitro cultivation of DAstV-1. We believe this valuable experimental system will contribute to the further study of DAstV-1 genome function and pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ruihua; Lan, Jingjing; Li, Haie; Chen, Junhao; Yang, Yupeng; Lin, Shaoli; Xie, Zhijing; Jiang, Shijin","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab49a01b79f3623438ca5e7f5833d95ef1701a55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6729042.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6729042/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bgl II"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of DAstV","virus pathogenesis","Infectious virus","infectious DAstV","infection of DEF cells","transfected cells","parental virus","cultivation of DAstV","rescued virus identification","virus rescue efficiency","rescue system","pDAstV","infectious clone of DAstV","trypsin","viral cDNA sequence","hepatitis delta virus ribozyme","day-old ducklings of rDAstV","improved DNA","valuable experimental system","growth characteristics of rDAstV","transcription of viral genomic cDNA","manipulation of viral genomes","Reverse genetics systems","infected ducklings","cDNA plasmid","BHK","report","pathogenesis of duck astrovirus type","extensive tissue tropism","hammerhead ribozyme","robust reverse genetic tools","RNA viruses","genome function","duck embryo fibroblast","homogenous RNA transcripts","eukaryotic promoter","Bgl","current knowledge","western blot","HdvRz","HamRz","peripheral immune organs","site","mRNA copies","serial passaging","IFA","shared similar replication kinetics","capable of invading","terminals","silent nucleotide mutation","Immunofluorescence assay","ORF2 gene","hazardous pathogens","baby hamster kidney","BACKGROUND","\u03BCg","CONCLUSIONS","Animal experiment","construction","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Although risk factors for RSV infection have been identified, the role of microbial species in the respiratory tract is only partially known. We aimed to understand the impact of interactions between the nasal microbiome and host transcriptome on the severity and clinical outcomes of RSV infection. We used 16 S rRNA sequencing to characterize the nasal microbiome of infants with RSV infection. We used RNA sequencing to interrogate the transcriptome of CD4(\u002B) T cells obtained from the same set of infants. After dimension reduction through principal component (PC) analysis, we performed an integrative analysis to identify significant co-variation between microbial clade and gene expression PCs. We then employed LIONESS (Linear Interpolation to Obtain Network Estimates for Single Samples) to estimate the clade-gene association patterns for each infant. Our network-based integrative analysis identified several clade-gene associations significantly related to the severity of RSV infection. The microbial taxa with the highest loadings in the implicated clade PCs included Moraxella, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus. Interestingly, many of the genes with the highest loadings in the implicated gene PCs are encoded in mitochondrial DNA, while others are involved in the host immune response. This study on microbiome-transcriptome interactions provides insights into how the host immune system mounts a response against RSV and specific infectious agents in nasal microbiota.","publish_time":"2019-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sonawane, Abhijeet R.; Tian, Liang; Chu, Chin-Yi; Qiu, Xing; Wang, Lu; Holden-Wiltse, Jeanne; Grier, Alex; Gill, Steven R.; Caserta, Mary T.; Falsey, Ann R.; Topham, David J.; Walsh, Edward E.; Mariani, Thomas J.; Weiss, Scott T.; Silverman, Edwin K.; Glass, Kimberly; Liu, Yang-Yu","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74af665d4b129e0ed662f50fa0d215f4ff2c2c52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6761288.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6761288/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of RSV infection","microbial clade","implicated clade PCs","implicated gene PCs","clade-gene associations","host transcriptome","clinical outcomes of RSV infection","gene expression PCs","microbiome-transcriptome interactions","nasal microbiome of infants","clade-gene association patterns","integrative analysis","host immune response","highest loadings","nasal microbiota","transcriptome of CD4","microbial taxa","host immune system","role of microbial species","Respiratory syncytial virus","major cause of lower respiratory tract infections","Network Estimates","impact of interactions","set of infants","S rRNA sequencing","hospital visits","Corynebacterium","significant co-variation","Streptococcus","Moraxella","specific infectious agents","insights","infancy","principal component","Haemophilus influenzae","Linear Interpolation","Single Samples","dimension reduction","T cells","mitochondrial DNA","Staphylococcus","childhood","LIONESS","study","risk factors","genes"],"language":"en"},

Glycoproteins (GP, including Gn and Gc) on the surface of Guertu virus (GTV) could bind to receptors on host cells and induce protective immunity in the host, but knowledge is now lacking on the information of B cell epitopes (BCEs) present on GTV-GP protein. The aim of this study was to identify all BCEs on Gn of the GTV DXM strain using rabbit pAbs against GTV-Gn. Seven fine BCEs and two antigenic peptides (APs) from nine reactive 16mer-peptides were identified, which are E(Gn)1 ((2)PIICEGLTHS(11)), E(Gn)2 ((135)CSQDSGT(141)), E(Gn)3 ((165)IP EDVF(170)), E(Gn)4 ((169)VFQEL K(174)), E(Gn)5 ((187)IDGILFN(193)), E(Gn)6 ((223)QTKWIQ(228)), E(Gn)7 ((237)CHKDGIGPC(245)), AP-8 ((299)GVRVRPKCYGFSRMMA(314)) and AP-9 ((355)CASH FCSSAESGKKNT(370)), of which six of mapped BCEs were recognized by the IgG-positive sheep serum obtained from sheep GTV-infected naturally.

This is the finest tradition of humanity and medicine, and all of these efforts at service through science inspire and give heart.","publish_time":"2020-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"McLean, Samuel","journal":"Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32223035/; https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.13974","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["AEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["triumphs","recent days","experienced moments of fear","great anxiety","experienced awe","place of great stress","time","year old ED clerk","healthcare providers","kid","medicine","teeth","buses","month","examples","shift","individuals","service","science","dark shadow","efforts","finest tradition of humanity","impulse","pages of AEM","bed","night","heart","Wuhan epidemic","corner","Feelings"],"language":"en"},

Generally, viroporins are composed of 50\u2013120 amino acid residues and possess a minimum of one hydrophobic region that interacts with the lipid bilayer and leads to dispersion. Viroporins are involved in destroying the morphology of host cells and disturbing their biological functions to complete the life cycle of the virus. The 2B proteins encoded by enteroviruses, which belong to the family Picornaviridae, can form transmembrane pores by oligomerization, increase the permeability of plasma membranes, disturb the homeostasis of calcium in cells, induce apoptosis, and cause autophagy; these abilities are shared among viroporins. The present paper introduces the structure and biological characteristics of various 2B proteins encoded by enteroviruses of the family Picornaviridae and may provide a novel idea for developing antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2014-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ao, Da; Sun, Shi-Qi; Guo, Hui-Chen","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fadcd6b5c3ddc519094af150095be7578d8499b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4155101.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-014-0087-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25163654/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Viroporins"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Viroporins","B proteins","group of transmembrane proteins","enteroviruses","family Picornaviridae","biological functions","transmembrane pores","biological characteristics of various","morphology of host cells","minimum","structure","low molecular weight","novel idea","permeability of plasma membranes","apoptosis","homeostasis of calcium","life cycle","oligomerization","lipid bilayer","hydrophobic region","cause autophagy","present paper","amino acid residues","antiviral drugs","abilities","dispersion","animal viruses"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Infants with CF identified by newborn screening were enrolled prior to 4 months of age to participate in a prospective observational study at 4 centers. Clinical data were collected at clinic visits and weekly phone calls. Multiplex PCR assays were performed on nasopharyngeal swabs to detect respiratory viruses during routine visits and when symptomatic. Participants underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and a subset underwent pulmonary function testing. We present findings through 8.5 months of life. RESULTS: Seventy infants were enrolled, mean age 3.1 \u00B1 0.8 months. Rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus (66%), followed by parainfluenza (19%), and coronavirus (16%). Participants had a median of 1.5 viral positive swabs (range 0\u201310). Past viral infection was associated with elevated neutrophil concentrations and bacterial isolates in BAL fluid, including recovery of classic CF bacterial pathogens. When antibiotics were prescribed for respiratory-related indications, viruses were identified in 52% of those instances. CONCLUSIONS: Early viral infections were associated with greater neutrophilic inflammation and bacterial pathogens. Early viral infections appear to contribute to initiation of lower airway inflammation in infants with CF. Antibiotics were commonly prescribed in the setting of a viral infection. Future investigations examining longitudinal relationships between viral infections, airway microbiome, and antibiotic use will allow us to elucidate the interplay between these factors in young children with CF.","publish_time":"2019-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deschamp, Ashley R.; Hatch, Joseph E.; Slaven, James E.; Gebregziabher, Netsanet; Storch, Gregory; Hall, Graham L.; Stick, Stephen; Ranganathan, Sarath; Ferkol, Thomas W.; Davis, Stephanie D.","journal":"J Cyst Fibros","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fde8ec984e9fab26dbb6c3f55318ca2f695b298f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6711838.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S156919931830804X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156919931830804X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2019.02.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826285/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Early viral infections","viral positive swabs","Past viral infection","Infants","months of age","impact of respiratory viruses","airway microbiome","bacterial isolates","recovery of classic CF bacterial pathogens","antibiotics","months of life","Participants","initiation of lower airway inflammation","development of airway disease","respiratory-related indications","BAL fluid","clinic visits","nasopharyngeal swabs","routine visits","mean age","greater neutrophilic inflammation","elevated neutrophil concentrations","longitudinal relationships","morbidity","subset","bronchoalveolar lavage","Future investigations","cystic fibrosis","weekly phone calls","bronchoscopy","median","newborn screening","prospective observational study","Multiplex PCR assays","antibiotic use","pulmonary function testing","interplay","factors","young children","centers","Clinical data","present findings","range","BACKGROUND","setting","CONCLUSIONS","Rhinovirus","prevalent virus","RESULTS","METHODS","parainfluenza","coronavirus","instances"],"language":"en"},

Upon sequence analysis of the short RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, the three strains displayed the highest nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identities to the prototype GIV.2 strain lion/Pistoia/387/06/ITA (91.0\u201393.0% nt and 97.0\u201398.0% aa). The sequence of ~ 3.4-kb portion at the 3\u2032 end of the genome of a NoV strain, TE/77-13/ITA, was determined. In the full-length ORF2, encoding the VP1 capsid protein, the virus was genetically closest to the canine GVI.2 NoV strains C33/Viseu/2007/PRT and FD53/2007/ITA (81.0\u201384.0% nt and 93.0\u201394.0% aa identities), suggesting a recombination nature, with the cross-over site being mapped to the ORF1-ORF2 junction. Based on the full-length VP1 amino acid sequence, we classified the novel feline NoV, together with the canine strains Viseu and FD53, as a genotype 2, within the genogroup GVI. These findings indicate that, as observed for GIV NoV, GVI strains may infect both the canine and feline host. Unrestricted circulation of NoV strains in small carnivores may provide the basis for quick genetic diversification of these viruses by recombination. Interspecies circulation of NoVs in pets must also be considered when facing outbreaks of enteric diseases in these animals.","publish_time":"2015-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Martino, Barbara; Di Profio, Federica; Melegari, Irene; Sarchese, Vittorio; Cafiero, Maria Assunta; Robetto, Serena; Aste, Giovanni; Lanave, Gianvito; Marsilio, Fulvio; Martella, Vito","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2baa4e07df066fb5c7cd8cf4445966cfcdfcf30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185403.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134815300848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26739218/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2015.12.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134815300848","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GVI strains","canine strains Viseu","strains C33","canine GVI","aa identities","full-length VP1 amino acid sequence","sequence analysis","FD53","full-length ORF2","genogroup GVI","Interspecies circulation of NoVs","young cats","prototype GIV","strain lion","healthy cats","recombination nature","Unrestricted circulation","specimens of animals","feline host","short RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","VP1 capsid protein","collection of fecal samples","ORF1-ORF2 junction","different shelters","RdRp","basis","quick genetic diversification","South Italy","noroviruses","small carnivores","region","highest nucleotide","genotype","Pistoia","PRT","genome","enteritis signs","outbreaks of enteric diseases","cross","pets","site","portion","findings"],"language":"en"},

Such events of reconnection and secondary contact of previously isolated populations are widely observed at different time scales. For example, during the quaternary glaciation, sea water level fluctuations caused temporal isolation of populations, often to be followed by secondary contact. At shorter time scales, population isolation and reconnection of viruses are commonly observed, and such events are often associated with epidemics and pandemics. Here, using coalescent theory and simulations, we describe the temporal impact of population reconnection after isolation on nucleotide differences and the site frequency spectrum, as well as common summary statistics of DNA variation. We identify robust genomic signatures of population reconnection after isolation. We utilize our development to infer the recent evolutionary history of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in Asia and South America, successfully retrieving the successive HIV subtype colonization events in these regions. Our analysis reveals that divergent HIV-1 subtype populations are currently admixing in these regions, suggesting that HIV-1 may be undergoing a process of homogenization, contrary to popular belief.","publish_time":"2015-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alcala, Nicolas; Jensen, Jeffrey D.; Telenti, Amalio; Vuilleumier, S\u00E9verine","journal":"G3 (Bethesda)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8d703462f802321d816c81555d52174ef477674.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4704709.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.115.024208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26546308/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","South America"],"keyphrases":["population isolation","events of reconnection","temporal isolation of populations","subtype populations","temporal impact of population reconnection","reconnection of viruses","isolated populations","divergent HIV","diverged populations","successive HIV subtype colonization events","robust genomic signatures of population reconnection","secondary contact","regions","different time scales","shorter time scales","sea water level fluctuations","nucleotide differences","organisms","quaternary glaciation","recent evolutionary history of human immunodeficiency virus","site frequency spectrum","increased opportunities","Ease of worldwide travel","common summary statistics of DNA variation","simulations","process of homogenization","popular belief","South America","new environments","development","Asia","coalescent theory","example","epidemics","analysis","pandemics"],"language":"en"},

To date, methods such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have not been developed for the rapid detection, quantitation and diagnosis of BECV. Presently, a BECV-specific SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay was evaluated and optimized. Diarrheic specimens (n = 118) collected from 2004 to 2005 were subjected to RT-PCR, nested PCR and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR. By conventional RT-PCR and nested PCR, 9 (7.6%) and 59 (50%) samples tested positive, respectively, whereas the SYBR Green assay detected BECV in 91 (77.1%) samples. Using BECV RNA standards generated by in vitro transcription, the SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay sensitively detected BECV RNA to 1.1 \u00D7 10(0) copies/\u03BCl (correlation coefficiency = 0.98). The detection limits of the RT-PCR and nested PCR were 1.1 \u00D7 10(5) and 1.1 \u00D7 10(2) copies/\u03BCl, respectively.

Two outcome measures were considered, with the first aiming to study SARS-CoV-2 infections and the second aiming to study COVID-19 mortality. Daily data as well as data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 mortality obtained between December 1, 2019 and March 28, 2020 were collected from weather stations around the world. The country\u0027s population density and time of exposure to the disease were used as control variables. Finally, a month dummy variable was added. Daily data by country were analyzed using the panel data model. An increase in the average daily temperature by one degree Fahrenheit reduced the number of cases by approximately 6.4 cases/day. There was a negative correlation between the average temperature per country and the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This association remained strong even with the incorporation of additional variables and controls (maximum temperature, average temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation) and fixed country effects. There was a positive correlation between precipitation and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Countries with higher rainfall measurements showed an increase in disease transmission. For each average inch/day, there was an increase of 56.01 cases/day. COVID-19 mortality showed no significant association with temperature.","publish_time":"2020-08-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sobral, Marcos Felipe Falc\u00E3o; Duarte, Gisleia Benini; da Penha Sobral, Ana Iza Gomes; Marinho, Marcelo Luiz Monteiro; de Souza Melo, Andr\u00E9","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c1d113f638776e2e4b6463752fe0752f1955c37.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7195330.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353724/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138997; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720325146; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720325146","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["average temperature","average daily temperature","maximum temperature","minimum temperature","study SARS-CoV","Daily data","average inch","precipitation","number of cases","increase","infections","mortality","study COVID","day","disease transmission","meteorological variables","aiming","control variables","panel data model","incorporation of additional variables","fixed country effects","positive correlation","negative correlation","significant association","controls","degree Fahrenheit","time of exposure","higher rainfall measurements","country\u0027s population density","deaths","Countries","weather stations","world","month dummy variable","associations","outcome measures","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

There is currently a lack of knowledge about the antibody response elicited from SARS-CoV-2 infection. One major immunological question concerns antigenic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We address this question by analyzing plasma from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV, and from infected or immunized mice. Our results show that, while cross-reactivity in antibody binding to the spike protein is common, cross-neutralization of the live viruses may be rare, indicating the presence of non-neutralizing antibody response to conserved epitopes in the spike. Whether such low or non-neutralizing antibody response leads to antibody-dependent disease enhancement needs to be addressed in the future. Overall, this study not only addresses a fundamental question regarding antigenicity differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, but also has implications for immunogen design and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Huibin; Wu, Nicholas C.; Tak-Yin Tsang, Owen; Yuan, Meng; Perera, Ranawaka A.P.

Chemical shifts of protons in GH1, UH3, and UH5 of GU pairs, UH3, UH5, and AH2 of AU pairs, and GH1 of GC pairs were analyzed to identify constraints for the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 directionality of base pairs in helices. The 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 directionality constraints were incorporated into an NMR-assisted prediction of secondary structure (NAPSS-CS) program. When it was tested on 18 structures, including nine pseudoknots, the sensitivity and positive predictive value were improved relative to those of three unrestrained programs.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: We review amassing evidence to help guide the management and timing of brachytherapy for gynecologic, breast, and prostate cancers. Where concrete data could not be found, peer-reviewed expert opinion is provided. RESULTS: There may be a significant negative impact on oncologic outcomes for patients with gynecologic malignancies who have a delay in the timely completion of therapy. Delay of prostate or breast cancer treatment may also impact oncologic outcomes. If a treatment delay is expected, endocrine therapy may be an appropriate temporizing measure before delivery of radiation therapy. The use of shorter brachytherapy fractionation schedules will help minimize patient exposure and conserve resources. CONCLUSIONS: Brachytherapy remains a critical treatment for patients and may shorten treatment time and exposure for some. Reduced patient exposure and resource utilization is important during COVID-19. Every effort should be made to ensure timely brachytherapy delivery for patients with gynecologic malignancies, and endocrine therapy may help temporize treatment delays for breast and prostate cancer patients. Physicians should continue to follow developing institutional, state, and federal guidelines/recommendations as challenges in delivering care during COVID-19 will continue to evolve.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Williams, Vonetta M.; Kahn, Jenna M.; Harkenrider, Matthew M.; Chino, Junzo; Chen, Jonathan; Fang, L.

Recombinant protein-based vaccines are usually formulated with aluminum (alum)-based adjuvants to ensure an adequate immune response. However, use of alum triggers a Th2-biased immune induction, and hence is not optimal. Although the adjuvanticity of RNA has been reported, a systematic and overall investigation on its efficacy is lacking. We found that single strand RNA (termed RNA adjuvant) derived from cricket paralysis virus intergenic region internal ribosome entry site induced the expression of various adjuvant-function-related genes, such as type 1 and 2 interferon (IFN) and toll-like receptor (TLR), T cell activation, and leukocyte chemotaxis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; furthermore, its innate and IFN transcriptome profile patterns were similar to those of a live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine. This suggests that protein-based vaccines formulated using RNA adjuvant function as live-attenuated vaccines. Application of the RNA adjuvant in mouse enhanced the efficacy of Middle East respiratory syndrome spike protein, a protein-subunit vaccine and human papillomavirus L1 protein, a virus-like particle vaccine, by activating innate immune response through TLR7 and enhancing pAPC chemotaxis, leading to a balanced Th1/Th2 responses. Moreover, the combination of alum and the RNA adjuvant synergistically induced humoral and cellular immune responses and endowed long-term immunity. Therefore, RNA adjuvants have broad applicability and can be used with all conventional vaccines to improve vaccine efficacy qualitatively and quantitively.","publish_time":"2019-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwak, Hye Won; Park, Hyo-Jung; Ko, Hae Li; Park, Hyelim; Cha, Min Ho; Lee, Sang-Myeong; Kang, Kyung Won; Kim, Rhoon-Ho; Ryu, Seung Rok; Kim, Hye-Jung; Kim, Jae-Ouk; Song, Manki; Kim, Hun; Jeong, Dae Gwin; Shin, Eui-Cheol; Nam, Jae-Hwan","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53ad783bd651dab3f1ff08e681a286db611075aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115557.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19309910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31371226/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X19309910; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.070","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","IFN"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["RNA adjuvant function","termed RNA adjuvant","vaccine efficacy","RNA adjuvants","adjuvanticity of RNA","protein-subunit vaccine","ideal adjuvant","Recombinant protein-based vaccines","particle vaccine","single strand RNA","Th2 responses","cellular immune responses","innate immune response","live-attenuated vaccines","expression of various adjuvant-function","based adjuvants","conventional vaccines","adequate immune response","yellow fever vaccine","human papillomavirus L1 protein","Th2-biased immune induction","efficacy of Middle East respiratory syndrome spike protein","balanced Th1","combination of alum","leukocyte chemotaxis","pAPC chemotaxis","IFN transcriptome profile patterns","human peripheral blood mononuclear cells","cricket paralysis virus intergenic region internal ribosome entry site","T cell activation","mouse","endowed long-term immunity","receptor","TLR7","aluminum","toll","related genes","overall investigation","broad applicability","Application","interferon"],"language":"en"},

In 2009, pregnant women accounted for 1% of patients infected with influenza A subtype H1N1 virus, but they accounted for 5% of all H1N1-related deaths6. In addition, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two notable strains of the coronavirus family, are both known to be responsible for severe complications during pregnancy, including the need for endotracheal intubation, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), renal failure and death7, 8. Interestingly, the impact of COVID-19 infection on pregnant women appears to be less severe. Chen et al.9 reported the clinical characteristics of nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the third trimester, which comprised mainly fever and cough. Other symptoms included myalgia, malaise, sore throat, diarrhea and shortness of breath. Data from laboratory tests showed that the majority of patients had lymphopenia and increased C-reactive protein, and chest CT scans showed multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs. Pregnancy complications that appeared after the onset of COVID-19 infection included fetal distress in two of nine patients and premature rupture of the membranes in two of nine patients. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. Another series10 of nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting from mid-trimester onwards, or during the postpartum period, reported similar findings except for one woman requiring ICU care and ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome after the infection was diagnosed 2?days postpartum. In general, both studies reported that the clinical characteristics of the pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia2-4. These observations are also in line with what has been learned about COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy in several other hospitals in Wuhan, China. Pregnant healthcare professionals should follow risk-assessment and infection-control guidelines following exposure to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Adherence to recommended infection prevention and control practices is an important part of protecting all healthcare professionals in clinical settings11.","publish_time":"2020-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, H.; Wang, C.; Poon, L.

To assess the in vitro antiviral activity of swine intestine antimicrobial peptides (SIAMP) against IBV, 45 chick embryos were randomly assigned into 3 groups, 15 for each group. Embryos in group 1 were inoculated with IBV. Group 2 was inoculated with SIAMP-IBV intermixture. Group 3 was used as a control and inoculated with sterile PBS. Allantoic fluid was collected for hemagglutination titer assay. In addition, weight gain, mortality, and pathological changes for each group were recorded. The results showed that no distinct pathological changes were found in chick embryos after they were inoculated with SIAMP-IBV intermixture and the mortality was reduced remarkably compared with the IBV-infected group. Weight gain of embryos in the SIAMP-IBV intermixture group was significantly higher than the IBV-infected embryos (P \u003C 0.01), which was also higher than the control group (P \u003C 0.05). Furthermore, the hemagglutination titer in the SIAMP-IBV group was significantly lower than that in the IBV-infected group (P \u003C 0.01).

The mean \u2211PAH levels in the waste ashes varied widely from 4.16 mg kg\u22121 to 198.92 mg kg\u22121, and the mean amounts of carcinogenic PAHs ranged from 0.74 to 96.77 mg kg\u22121, exceeding the limits regulated by several countries. Among the three types of incinerators, two medium-scale incinerators generated relatively high levels of PAHs (mean \u2211PAH 22.50 and 198.92 mg kg\u22121) compared to small-scale and large-scale incinerators (mean \u2211PAH 4.16 and 16.43 mg kg\u22121). Bottom ashes were dominated by low molecular weight PAHs (LM-PAH; containing two- to three-ringed PAHs) and medium molecular weight PAHs (MM-PAH; containing four-ringed PAHs), while fly ashes were abundant in MM-PAH and high molecular weight PAHs (HM-PAH, containing five- to six-ringed PAHs). Statistical analysis indicated that there was a positive relationship (R 2 =0.88) between organic matter and total PAHs thus it has the potential to be used as an indicator for PAHs in HW ashes. Moreover, it was found that PAHs in the ashes correlated highly with some metallic elements either positively (e.g. Fe, Ti, Mg) or negatively (Ca), indicating that these elements might promote or prevent PAH formation during HW combustion. Although bottom ash resulted from HW incinerators has not been classified as hazardous material, the results of this study indicated that this type of waste ash contained high levels of PAHs thus need special treatment before landfill.","publish_time":"2008-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Lijuan; Zhang, Fu-Shen; Hao, Zhengping; Wang, Hailin","journal":"Science of The Total Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b91e1cbee2ed8a6aed708faa79d48cb0732cac8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112068.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896970800226X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896970800226X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18440054/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.02.040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ringed PAHs","total PAHs","high levels of PAHs","PAH levels","HW ashes","high molecular weight PAHs","medium molecular weight PAHs","LM-PAH","HM-PAH","PAH formation","low molecular weight PAHs","HW incinerators","mean amounts of carcinogenic PAHs","Abstract Waste ashes","types of incinerators","large-scale incinerators","medium-scale incinerators","HW combustion","types of hospital waste","type of waste ash","metallic elements","SARS","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","period","properties","polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","special treatment","study","indicator","organic matter","results","China","Fe","hazardous material","potential","landfill","positive relationship","Statistical analysis","limits","countries"],"language":"en"},

The relative contribution of viruses in acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) is, however, poorly documented in Lao PDR. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the etiology of ALRI in patients of all ages in two hospitals of Laos. METHODS: Multiplex PCR/RT\u2010PCR methods were used to target 18 major common respiratory viruses. Between August 2009 and October 2010, samples from 292 patients presenting with ALRI were collected. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Viruses were detected in 162 (55%) samples. In 48% (140/292) of the total ALRI cases, a single virus was detected while coinfections were observed in 8% (22/292) of the samples. The most frequent viruses were rhinovirus/enterovirus (35%), human respiratory syncytial virus (26%), and influenza viruses (13%). Parainfluenza viruses were detected in 9%, adenovirus in 6%, human metapneumovirus in 4%, coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1) in 4%, and bocavirus in 3% of ALRI specimens. Most viral infections occurred in patients below 5 years of age. The distribution of viruses varied according to age\u2010groups. No significant correlation was observed between the severity of the disease and the age of patients or the virus species. This study provides the description of viral etiology among patients presenting with ALRI in Lao PDR. Additional investigations are required to better understand the clinical role of the different viruses and their seasonality in Laos.","publish_time":"2013-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sentilhes, Anne\u2010Charlotte; Choumlivong, Khamla; Celhay, Olivier; Sisouk, Thongchanh; Phonekeo, Darouny; Vongphrachanh, Phengta; Brey, Paul; Buchy, Philippe","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/608318d1cbddf1a10ea1d6faca8b4cacf8467c29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4634274.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23796419/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALRI"],"locations":["Laos"],"keyphrases":["different viruses","frequent viruses","distribution of viruses","Parainfluenza viruses","age of patients","etiology of ALRI","major common respiratory viruses","ALRI specimens","relative contribution of viruses","Acute respiratory infections","samples","total ALRI cases","acute lower respiratory infections","viral infections","human respiratory syncytial virus","PCR methods","single virus","virus species","years of age","study","OBJECTIVE","Lao PDR","major burden of disease","description of viral etiology","Multiplex PCR","human metapneumovirus","hospitals of Laos","important cause of morbidity","mortality","NL63","coronaviruses","developing countries","severity","enterovirus","ages","OC43","HKU1","rhinovirus","clinical role","seasonality","BACKGROUND","significant correlation","adenovirus","coinfections","bocavirus","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","groups","Additional investigations"],"language":"en"},

The coronavirus spike proteins are very effective molecular mechanisms, which provide the coronavirus entrance to the host cell. The number of these spikes is different; it dramatically depends on external conditions and determines the degree of danger of the virus. A larger number of spike proteins makes the virus infectivity stronger. This paper describes a mathematical model of the shape of coronavirus virions. Based on this model, the characteristics of light scattered by the coronavirus virions were calculated. It was found two main features of coronavirus model particles in the spectral region near 200 nm: a minimum of intensity and a sharp leap of the linear polarization degree. The effect of the spike protein number on the intensity and polarization properties of the scattered light was studied. It was determined that when the number of spike proteins decreases, both the intensity minimum and the position of the linear polarization leap shift to shorter wavelengths. This allows us to better evaluate the shape of the coronavirus virion, and, therefore, the infectious danger of the virus. It was shown that the shorter the wavelength of scattered light, the more reliably one can distinguish viruses from non-viruses. The developed model and the light scattering simulations based on it can be applied not only to coronaviruses, but also to other objects of a similar structure, for example, pollen.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petrov, Dmitry","journal":"Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59e07d155f16408cae49a9314d40eb8ad7264d7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152864.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2020.107005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292212/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022407320302363; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407320302363","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coronavirus spike proteins","shape of coronavirus virions","coronavirus entrance","Abstract Coronavirus virions","larger number of spike proteins","spike protein number","main features of coronavirus model particles","wavelength of scattered light","minimum of intensity","intensity minimum","developed model","mathematical model","characteristics of light","linear polarization degree","linear polarization leap shift","polarization properties","spherical shape","light scattering simulations","degree of danger","virus infectivity stronger","sharp leap","shorter wavelengths","infectious danger","non-viruses","position","effective molecular mechanisms","spectral region","similar structure","nm","objects","example","pollen","external conditions","host cell","spikes","paper","coronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

To define the region conferring residency in the ER, we examined two mutant forms of the viral protein. A 5 amino acid extension of the 15-membered cytoplasmic tail of the protein reduces its interaction with class I antigens but does not change its intracellular distribution. Shortening the tail to 7 amino acids also diminishes the affinity for class I antigens; however, this mutant E19 protein becomes transported to the cell surface.

ANIMALS: Forty\u2010three horses \u003E1 year of age with results of CBC, serum biochemistry, and fecal diagnostic testing for ECoV and Salmonella spp. METHODS: Medical records of horses presented to the North Carolina State University Equine and Farm Animal Veterinary Center (2003\u2010016) were retrospectively reviewed. Horses were divided into 3 groups based on fecal diagnostic test results: ECoV\u2010positive, Salmonella\u2010positive, or unknown diagnosis (UNK).

Data were analyzed by 1\u2010way analysis of variance, Kruskal\u2010Wallis test, or Fisher\u0027s exact test with significance set at P \u003C .05. RESULTS: Most common presenting complaints were fever and colic and were similar across groups.

The experimental and control groups performed balance training by using the newly developed Spine Balance 3D system and the well-known Biodex Balance System 30 minutes per day, three times a week for 7 weeks. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS), 10-m walking test (10mWT), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), Functional Reach Test (FRT), the Korean version of the Fall Efficacy Scale-International (KFES-I), trunk muscle strength and stability were evaluated before and after 7 weeks of intervention.

The complex interplay between host, pathogen and environment creates a challenge for conserving species, communities and ecosystem functions, while mediating the many known ecological and socio-economic negative effects of disease. Despite the clear ecological and evolutionary contexts of host\u2013pathogen dynamics, approaches to managing wildlife disease remain predominantly reactionary, focusing on surveillance and some attempts at eradication. A few exceptional studies have heeded recent calls for better integration of ecological concepts in the study and management of wildlife disease; however, evolutionary concepts remain underused. Applied evolution consists of four principles: evolutionary history, genetic and phenotypic variation, selection and eco-evolutionary dynamics. In this article, we first update a classical framework for understanding wildlife disease to integrate better these principles. Within this framework, we explore the evolutionary implications of environment\u2013disease interactions. Subsequently, we synthesize areas where applied evolution can be employed in wildlife disease management. Finally, we discuss some future directions and challenges. Here, we underscore that despite some evolutionary principles currently playing an important role in our understanding of disease in wild animals, considerable opportunities remain for fostering the practice of evolutionarily enlightened wildlife disease management.","publish_time":"2014-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vander Wal, Eric; Garant, Dany; Calm\u00E9, Sophie; Chapman, Colin A; Festa-Bianchet, Marco; Millien, Virginie; Rioux-Paquette, S\u00E9bastien; Pelletier, Fanie","journal":"Evol Appl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c992817218f27eaa39a7bc3b90e9bd0538017eb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4227862.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25469163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of wildlife disease","understanding of disease","evolutionary principles","disease interactions","enlightened wildlife disease management","evolutionary concepts","evolutionary history","evolutionary contexts of host","evolutionary implications of environment","eco-evolutionary dynamics","socio-economic negative effects of disease","pathogen dynamics","better integration of ecological concepts","Applied evolution","classical framework","phenotypic variation","biodiversity","food safety","recent calls","conserving species","selection","practice","pressing global threats","study","communities","considerable opportunities","wild animals","important role","emerging infectious diseases","ecosystem functions","human health","exceptional studies","complex interplay","surveillance","future directions","challenges","attempts","eradication","areas","article"],"language":"en"},

Applying their antipathogenic, antiproliferative, and immune stimulatory capacities, recombinant IFNs are frequently prescribed as drugs to treat different diseases. IFNs act by changing the gene expression profile of cells. Due to characteristics such as rapid gene induction and signaling, IFNs also represent prototypical model systems for various aspects of biomedical research (e.g., signal transduction). In regard to the signaling and activated promoters, IFNs can be subdivided into two groups. Here, alterations of the cellular proteome of human cells treated with IFN\u03B1 and IFN\u03B3 were elucidated in a time-resolved manner by quantitative proteome analysis. The majority of protein regulations were strongly IFN type and time dependent. In addition to the expected upregulation of IFN-responsive proteins, an astonishing number of proteins became profoundly repressed especially by IFN\u03B3. Thus, our comprehensive analysis revealed important insights into the human IFN-regulated proteome and its dynamics of protein induction and repression.

Enterovirus, a genus of positive-strand RNA virus, can cause various human diseases and is one of main public health threat globally, yet no effective clinical intervention is available for enterovirus infection. Here we summarized recent literature on how enteroviruses regulate and utilize autophagy process to facilitate their propagation in the host cells.

Through such an analysis, the regression period of maternally derived antibodies and optimum vaccination time in calves can be recommended. A total of 10 farms were grouped as large (4)-, medium (2)- and small (4)- sized enterprises according to their animal population. Newborn calves (n: 94) delivered during a calendar month on the farms were studied. Blood samples were collected from these calves during their 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th months of age. Blood samples were also taken from their dams during the first sampling. Neutralizing antibody titers were detected using the serum neutralization test (SN50). New PI-3 and BVDV infections at the early stages of life were determined in the calves. Maternal antibodies began to decrease in the 2nd month for BRSV, BHV-1 and BAV-3 (97.8%, 25.5% and 91.4%) and in the 3rd month for PI-3, BVDV and BCoV (85.1%, 67% and 93.6%). It was concluded that maternal antibodies begin to decrease after the 1st month and that the possible first exposure of calves to respiratory viruses is after the 2nd month. Therefore, it is recommended that the first vaccination program including prime and booster doses can be applied between 2 and 4 months of age. Furthermore, re-vaccination of animals at 6 months after the booster dose is also suggested.","publish_time":"2015-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuncer, Pelin; Ye\u015Filba\u011F, Kadir","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3ca6acccd863652e5bef86e36e8df64c2069cff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131052.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26380946/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515300146; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515300146; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.08.025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BVDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bovine coronavirus","bovine herpesvirus","bovine viral diarrhea virus","bovine parainfluenza virus type","bovine adenovirus type","exposure of calves","Newborn calves","calendar month","infection dynamics of bovine respiratory syncytial virus","Maternal antibodies","months of age","BRSV","respiratory viruses","BVDV infections","vaccination program","derived antibodies","New PI","BAV","BHV","BCoV","farms","Blood samples","optimum vaccination time","re-vaccination of animals","important viral pathogens of respiratory disease complex","booster doses","regression period","sized enterprises","serum neutralization test","ruminants","early stages of life","Neutralizing antibody titers","animal population","SN50","study","analysis","dams","sampling","aim","total"],"language":"en"},

We analyzed the mechanisms by which HBD 2 primes innate antiviral immunity and polarized activation of macrophage-like THP-1 cells using the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein (S RBD) as a model antigen. The expression of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (Nod2), type I interferons, (IFNs), and proinflammatory mediators was enhanced in S RBD-HBD 2-treated THP-1 cells. S RBD-HBD 2 treatment also enhanced phosphorylation and activation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 and IFN regulatory factor 3 compared to S RBD alone. Finally, HBD 2-conjugated S RBD interacted with C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), and Nod2 was involved in HBD 2-mediated CCR2 signaling, which was associated with the activation and M1 polarization of THP-1 cells. Therefore, HBD 2 promotes CCR2-mediated Nod2 signaling, which induces production of type I IFNs and an inflammatory response, and enhances primary innate immunity leading to an effective adaptive immune response to HBD 2-conjugated antigen.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Ju; Yang, Ye Lin; Jang, Yong-Suk","journal":"Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/251aa85d0c8bd8dcf09af2e7c99cc8da128614d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114636.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171298519301123; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2019.05.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171298519301123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31126693/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HBD","RBD","C-C"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["S RBD-HBD","conjugated S RBD","innate immune cells","primary innate immunity","innate defense","activation of receptor","CCR2-mediated Nod2","mediated CCR2","receptor-binding domain","effective adaptive immune response","antiviral immunity","C-C chemokine receptor","inflammatory response","treated THP","IFNs","conjugated antigen","binding oligomerization domain","polarized activation of macrophage","M1 polarization of THP","spike protein","model antigen","production of type","threonine-protein kinase","MERS-CoV","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","IFN regulatory factor","primes","serine","roles","treatment","viruses","expression of nucleotide","various pathogens","details","induction","viral infection","proinflammatory mediators","phosphorylation","Abstract Beta-defensins","human \u03B2-defensin","interferons","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Steviol glucosides include rubusoside (Ru), stevioside (Ste), and rebaudioside (Reb), which have immunomodulatory capability and protective effects against hyperglycemia, hypertension, inflammation, tumors, and diarrhea. In addition, they can enhance the solubility of epotoside, liquiritin, paclitaxel, curcuminoids, quercetin, and wheat bran flavonoids, thus increasing their permeability. The hydrolysis of three glucosyl groups at positions C13 and C19 of Ste will produce steviolbioside, steviol, isosteviol, steviol mono-glucoside, or Ru. S. rebaudiana contains these hydrolyzed products in trace amounts. This chapter describes recent advances in the preparation of various steviol glycosides from Ste by using different \u03B2-glycosidases, with particular focus on their potential industrial applications as natural solubilizers of insoluble compounds.

Despite extensive studies, it remains unresolved how cis-elements just downstream of the recoding site promote a precise level of frameshifting. The Umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus RNA2 expresses its RNA polymerase by -1 PRF of the 5\u2032-proximal ORF (p33). Three hairpins located in the vicinity of the recoding site are phylogenetically conserved among Umbraviruses. The central Recoding Stimulatory Element (RSE), located downstream of the p33 termination codon, is a large hairpin with two asymmetric internal loops. Mutational analyses revealed that sequences throughout the RSE and the RSE lower stem (LS) structure are important for frameshifting. SHAPE probing of mutants indicated the presence of higher order structure, and sequences in the LS may also adapt an alternative conformation. Long-distance pairing between the RSE and a 3\u2032 terminal hairpin was less critical when the LS structure was stabilized. A basal level of frameshifting occurring in the absence of the RSE increases to 72% of wild-type when a hairpin upstream of the slippery site is also deleted. These results suggest that suppression of frameshifting may be needed in the absence of an active RSE conformation.","publish_time":"2016-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Feng; Simon, Anne E.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e745a55d651d2f45443c39ed949185d8f968500a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4737148.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv1241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26578603/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Mutational","RSE","LS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LS structure","active RSE conformation","recoding site","suppression of frameshifting","ribosomal frameshifting","RSE lower stem","precise level of frameshifting","basal level of frameshifting","large hairpin","terminal hairpin","sequences","absence","PRF","slippery site","RNA polymerase","presence of higher order structure","central Recoding Stimulatory Element","alternative conformation","p33 termination codon","positive-strand RNA viruses","Umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus RNA2","translation of required products","asymmetric internal loops","SHAPE probing of mutants","cis-elements","vicinity","extensive studies","proximal ORF","Mutational analyses","wild-type","results","Long-distance pairing","Umbraviruses","hairpins"],"language":"en"},

The traditional focus on border screening, and by airline and cruise industries may be inadequate due to the incubation period of an infectious disease. This case study highlights the potential role of the hotel industry in epidemic preparedness and response. METHODS: This case study focuses on the epidemic outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and H1N1 swine flu in 2009 in Hong Kong, and the subsequent guidelines published by the health authority in relation to the hotel industry in Hong Kong which provide the backbone for discussion. RESULTS: The Metropole Hotel hastened the international spread of the 2003 SARS outbreak by the index case infecting visitors from Singapore, Vietnam, Canada as well as local people via close contact with the index case and the environmental contamination. The one-week quarantine of more than 300 guests and staff at the Metropark Hotel during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu exposed gaps in the partnership with the hotel industry. The subsequent guidelines for the hotel industry from the Centre of Health Protection focused largely on the maintenance of hygiene within the hotel premises. CONCLUSION: Positive collaborations may bring about effective preparedness across the health and the tourism sectors for future epidemics. Regular hygiene surveillance at hotel facilities, and developing coordination mechanism for impending epidemics on the use of screening, swift reporting and isolation of infected persons may help mitigate the impact of future events. Preparedness and contingency plans for infectious disease control for the hotel industry requires continuous engagement and dialogue.","publish_time":"2018-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hung, Kevin K.

Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for deciding the appropriate clinical approach and minimizing unnecessary prescription of antibiotics. Diagnosis of RV is extremely challenging due to genetic and serological variability among its numerous types and their similarity to enteroviruses. Objective: We sought to develop a rapid nucleic acid test that can be used for the detection of Rhinovirus within both laboratory and near patient settings. Study design: We developed and evaluated a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method called Reverse Transcription Strand Invasion-Based Amplification (RT-SIBA) to rapidly detect Rhinovirus from clinical specimens. Result: The method, RT-SIBA, detected RV in clinical specimens with high analytical sensitivity (96%) and specificity (100%). The time to positive result was significantly shorter for the RV RT-SIBA assay than for a reference RV nucleic acid amplification method (RT-qPCR). Conclusion: The rapid detection time of the RV SIBA assay, as well as its compatibility with portable instruments, will facilitate prompt diagnosis of infection and thereby improve patient care.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kainulainen, Veera; Elf, Sonja; Susi, Petri; M\u00E4ki, Minna; Pitk\u00E4ranta, Anne; Koskinen, Janne O.; Korpela, Riitta; Eboigbodin, Kevin E.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1de4fa1d2edead95545fa80b36501f2491b94ce5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113843.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.10.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093418303902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347198/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093418303902","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Reverse Transcription Strand"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Diagnosis of RV","RV SIBA assay","RV RT-SIBA assay","detected RV","reference RV nucleic acid amplification method","RT-qPCR","clinical specimens","detection of Rhinovirus","novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method","rapid nucleic acid test","rapid detection time","prompt diagnosis of infection","timely diagnosis","appropriate clinical approach","positive result","patient settings","patient care","Reverse Transcription Strand Invasion-Based Amplification","major cause of respiratory infection","humans","numerous types","high analytical sensitivity","serological variability","enormous economic burden","unnecessary prescription of antibiotics","portable instruments","laboratory","indirect costs","similarity","enteroviruses","compatibility","Conclusion","Abstract Background","illness","Study design","specificity","Objective"],"language":"en"},

As the world\u2019s most populated country and the second biggest economy in the world, China used to have a fragile PHEMS; however, the government took forceful actions to build PHEMS after the 2003 SARS outbreak. After more than one decade\u2019s efforts, we tried to assess the improvements and problems of China\u2019s PHEMS between 2002 and 2012. METHODS: We conducted two rounds of national surveys and collected the data of the year 2002 and 2012, including all 32 provincial, 139 municipal, and 489 county CDCs. The municipal and county CDCs were selected by systematic random sampling. Twenty-one indicators of four stages (preparation, readiness, response and recovery) from the National Assessment Criteria for CDC Performance were chosen to assess the ten-year trends. RESULTS: At the preparation stage, organization, mechanisms, workforce, and stockpile across all levels and regions were significantly improved after one decade\u2019s efforts. At the readiness stage, the capability for formulating an emergency plan was also significantly improved during the same period. At the response stage, internet-based direct reporting was 98.8%, and coping scores were nearly full points of ten in 2012. At the recovery stage, the capabilities were generally lower than expected. CONCLUSIONS: Due to forceful leadership, sounder regulations, and intensive resources, China\u2019s PHEMS has been improved at the preparation, readiness, and response stages; however, the recovery stage was still weak and could not meet the requirements of crisis management and preventive governance. In addition, CDCs in the Western region and counties lagged behind in performance on most indicators. Future priorities should include developing the recovery stage, establishing a closed feedback loop, and strengthening the capabilities of CDCs in Western region and counties.","publish_time":"2018-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Mei; Xu, Ningze; Li, Chengyue; Wu, Dan; Zou, Jiatong; Wang, Ying; Luo, Li; Yu, Mingzhu; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Hua; Shi, Peiwu; Chen, Zheng; Wang, Jian; Lu, Yueliang; Li, Qi; Wang, Xinhua; Bi, Zhenqiang; Fan, Ming; Fu, Liping; Yu, Jingjin; Hao, Mo","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbbac6572458c12b598b642d848b3852f2999573.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5896068.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-5284-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29642902/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Assessment Criteria","CDC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["recovery stage","preparation stage","readiness stage","capabilities of CDCs","county CDCs","response stages","fragile PHEMS","problems of China\u2019s PHEMS","Western region","counties","indicators","decade\u2019s efforts","public health emergency management systems","Public health emergencies","forceful leadership","CDC Performance","emergency plan","forceful actions","National Assessment Criteria","requirements of crisis management","rounds of national surveys","PHEMSs","sounder regulations","intensive resources","biggest economy","workforce","mechanisms","government","closed feedback loop","populated country","stockpile","preventive governance","direct reporting","internet","organization","capability","systematic random sampling","levels","countries","regions","data","BACKGROUND","improvements","addition","coping scores","Future priorities","points","world\u2019s","CONCLUSIONS","SARS outbreak","RESULTS","ten-year trends","century","METHODS","period"],"language":"en"},

Virus budding in general involves the distortion of a cellular membrane away from the cytoplasm, envelopment of the viral capsid by one or more lipid bilayers that are enriched in viral membrane glycoproteins, and a fission event that separates the enveloped virion from the cellular membrane. While it was initially thought that virus budding is always driven by viral transmembrane proteins interacting with the inner structural proteins, it is now clear that the driving force may be different depending on the virus. Research over the past years has shown that viral components specifically interact with host cell lipids and proteins, thereby adopting cellular functions and pathways to facilitate virus release. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the cellular membrane systems that serve as viral budding sites and of the viral and cellular factors involved in budding. One of the best studied cellular machineries required for virus egress is the ESCRT complex, which will be described in more detail.","publish_time":"2007-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Welsch, Sonja; M\u00FCller, Barbara; Kr\u00E4usslich, Hans-Georg","journal":"FEBS Lett","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f513f58f3b0468656b956aa6067d15e744edb486.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4ad9cd9f0c8f9f9b0f1d0ac051a356ee997dcbc5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126970.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014579307003146; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014579307003146","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus budding","cellular membrane systems","viral membrane glycoproteins","cellular functions","cellular factors","viral budding sites","viral components","viral capsid","viral transmembrane proteins","virus egress","virus release","best studied cellular machineries","host cell lipids","inner structural proteins","enveloped virion","Enveloped viruses","fission event","current knowledge","cytoplasm","driving force","different depending","past years","envelopment","pathways","lipid bilayers","distortion","ESCRT complex","general","Research","review"],"language":"en"},

Pregnancy and weaning rates have generally been used to measure the reproductive performance of herds.

More specifically, reproductive efficiency is influenced by (1) pregnancy rate which is influenced by (i) age at puberty; (ii) duration of post-partum anoestrus; (iii) fertilisation failure and (iv) embryo survival; while (2) weight by number of calves per breeding female retained for mating is influenced by (i) cow survival; (ii) foetal survival; and (iii) calf survival; and (3) overall lifetime calf weight weaned per mating. These measures of reproductive efficiency are discussed in depth. Further, a range of infectious and non-infectious factors, namely, environmental, physiological, breed and genetic factors and their impact on these stages of the reproductive cycle are investigated and implications for the northern Australian beef industry are discussed. Finally, conclusions and recommendations to minimise reproductive inefficiencies based on current knowledge are presented.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burns, B.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all the patients admitted to the acute MERS inpatient unit at the NMC during the 2015 outbreak. RESULTS: 30 (75%) were confirmed to be MERS-CoV positive among 40 admitted cases. Among the 24 MERS survivors, 17 (70.8%) exhibited psychiatric symptoms and 10 (41.7%) received a psychiatric diagnosis and medication during their hospital stay. Suspected MERS patients did not exhibit psychiatric symptoms or receive a psychiatric diagnosis. 27 suspected or confirmed MERS patients (age 41.15\u00B118.64, male 37.0%) completed psychological assessments. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-Short form and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores were significantly positively correlated with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the acute treatment of MERS-CoV infections in quarantine had a significant impact on the patients\u2019 mental health.

While there is neither an effective vaccine, nor a curative treatment for FIP, a diagnostic protocol for FCoV would greatly assist in the management and control of the virus. Clinical findings in FIP are non-specific and not helpful in making a differential diagnosis. Haematological and biochemical abnormalities in FIP cases are also non-specific. The currently available serological tests have low specificity and sensitivity for detection of active infection and cross-react with FCoV strains of low pathogenicity, the feline enteric coronaviruses (FECV). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used to detect FCoV and is rapid and sensitive, but results must be interpreted in the context of clinical findings. At present, a definitive diagnosis of FIP can be established only by histopathological examination of biopsies.

To stop the spread of an emerging disease, it is important to practice prevention guidelines correctly. Objectives The purpose of this study was to investigate factors influencing preventive behavior against MERS-CoV among Korean nursing students. Methods This is a cross-sectional study using a questionnaire survey. Data were collected from 429 nursing students from three colleges of nursing in Korea from June 25 to July 3 in 2015. Results Preventive behavior against MERS-CoV was affected mostly by attitude (\u03B2=.243, p \u003C.001). Such behavior was also high in relation to the variables of perceived risk (\u03B2=.232, p \u003C.001), older students (\u03B2=.202, p \u003C.001), knowledge level (\u03B2=.153, p \u003C.01), and female respondents (\u03B2=.115, p \u003C.05). Conclusion Preventive behavior against emerging infectious diseases such as MERS-CoV was found to be affected most significantly by attitude and risk perception. It is crucial to provide nursing students with information or knowledge, but it is also important to help those in nursing education recognize that active preventive behavior can prevent this infectious disease and stop its spread.","publish_time":"2016-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Jeong-Sil; Kim, Ji-Soo","journal":"Nurse Education Today","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ab59d507a063d4384a5393841f677a81c20837a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130744.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0260691716001052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27125168/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691716001052; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2016.03.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Middle East","Korea"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","emerging disease","Conclusion Preventive behavior","active preventive behavior","Korean nursing students","nursing education","colleges of nursing","older students","emerging infectious diseases","South Korea","attitude","spread","Middle East region","cross-sectional study","knowledge level","risk perception","Abstract Background Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","variables of perceived risk","relation","information","factors","questionnaire survey","major areas","female respondents","Objectives","purpose","prevention guidelines","Methods","Data","hospitals"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The HIS (hospital information system) modified influenza surveillance system (ISS) and a newly built pneumonia surveillance system (PSS) were used to monitor the influenza viruses in Changsha City, China. The ISS was used to monitor outpatients in two sentinel hospitals and to detect mild influenza and avian influenza cases, and PSS was used to monitor inpatients in 49 hospitals and to detect severe and death influenza cases. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2016, there were 3,551,917 outpatients monitored by the ISS system, among whom 126,076 were influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, with the ILI proportion (ILI%) of 3.55%. After the HIS was used, the reported incident cases of ILI and ILI% were increased significantly. From March, 2009 to September, 2016, there were 5,491,560 inpatient cases monitored by the PSS system, among which 362,743 were pneumonia cases, with a proportion of 6.61%. Among pneumonia cases, about 10.55% (38,260/362,743) of cases were severe or death cases. The pneumonia incidence increased each year in the city. Among 15 avian influenza cases reported from January, 2005 to September, 2016, there were 26.7% (4/15) mild cases detected by the HIS-modified ISS system, while 60.0% (9/15) were severe or death cases detected by the PSS system. Two H5N1 severe cases were missed by the ISS system in January, 2009 when the PSS system was not available. CONCLUSIONS: The HIS was able to improve the efficiency of the ISS for monitoring ILI and emerging avian influenza virus. However, the efficiency of the system needs to be verified in a wider area for a longer time span in China.","publish_time":"2019-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Xiaorong; Yang, Dong; Liu, Ruchun; Li, Yaman; Hu, Qingqing; Ma, Xinrui; Li, Yelan; Zhang, Heng; Zhang, Xixing; Zhao, Benhua; Chen, Tianmu","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb02e66bf6c521ac15b2dfa14b2b7966f137c876.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6751661.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-4405-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533638/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ISS","PSS","ILI"],"locations":["Changsha City","China"],"keyphrases":["avian influenza cases","pneumonia cases","death influenza cases","death cases","PSS system","mild cases","influenza surveillance system","inpatient cases","H5N1 severe cases","modified ISS system","mild influenza","reported incident cases of ILI","influenza viruses","emerging avian influenza virus","built pneumonia surveillance system","ILI proportion","hospital information system","monitoring ILI","pneumonia incidence","China","efficiency","outpatients","sentinel hospitals","Changsha City","emerging infectious disease","important public health strategy","longer time span","wider area","year","BACKGROUND","illness","METHODS","inpatients","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a \u201Cpublic-health emergency of international concern\u201D due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus the objective of this study is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using immunoinformatics approach. Several techniques facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine is rapidly needed to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety, immunogenic profile and to help on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdelmageed, Miyssa I.; Abdelmoneim, Abdelrahman H.; Mustafa, Mujahed I.; Elfadol, Nafisa M.; Murshed, Naseem S.; Shantier, Shaza W.; Makhawi, Abdelrafie M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d804bde249ed35784ae7ee4350a4acde52c83c3d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/74b00f19c3af87d1081644f02490ba250f57b7ca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.934232","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","MHC"],"locations":["Wuhan City","China"],"keyphrases":["vaccine design","COVID","proposed vaccine","T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine","multi epitope peptide vaccine","coronavirus disease","comparative genomic approach","combination of immunoinformatics approach","envelope protein","MHC class","order","immunogenic target","spread","World Health Organization","New endemic disease","comparative sequencing","potential peptides","novel coronavirus","immunogenic profile","adequate world population coverage","public-health emergency of international concern","deletion","promising candidates","emerging infection","insertion","approved treatment","Wuhan City","Extensive mutations","objective","study","safety","weeks","techniques","strain","nCoV","devastating global outbreaks","epidemic","China"],"language":"en"},

Without knowledge of virus viability, infection risk analyses lack accuracy. This pilot study was performed to (i) determine whether infectious (viable) respiratory viruses in aerosols could be collected from air in a real world environment by the viable virus aerosol sampler (VIVAS), (ii) compare and contrast the efficacy of the standard bioaerosol sampler, the BioSampler, with that of the VIVAS for the collection of airborne viruses in a real world environment, and (iii) gain insights for the use of the VIVAS for respiratory virus sampling. The VIVAS operates via a water vapor condensation process to enlarge aerosolized virus particles to facilitate their capture. A variety of viable human respiratory viruses, including influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and influenza B viruses, were collected by the VIVAS located at least 2 m from seated patients, during a late-onset 2016 influenza virus outbreak. Whereas the BioSampler when operated following our optimized parameters also collected virus aerosols, it was nevertheless overall less successful based on a lower frequency of virus isolation in most cases. This side-by-side comparison highlights some limitations of past studies based on impingement-based sampling, which may have generated false-negative results due to either poor collection efficiency and/or virus inactivation due to the collection process. IMPORTANCE The significance of virus aerosols in the natural transmission of respiratory diseases has been a contentious issue, primarily because it is difficult to collect or sample virus aerosols using currently available air sampling devices. We tested a new air sampler based on water vapor condensation for efficient sampling of viable airborne respiratory viruses in a student health care center as a model of a real world environment. The new sampler outperformed the industry standard device (the SKC BioSampler) in the collection of natural virus aerosols and in maintaining virus viability. These results using the VIVAS indicate that respiratory virus aerosols are more prevalent and potentially pose a greater inhalation biohazard than previously thought. The VIVAS thus appears to be a useful apparatus for microbiology air quality tests related to the detection of viable airborne viruses.","publish_time":"2017-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Maohua; Bonny, Tania S.; Loeb, Julia; Jiang, Xiao; Lednicky, John A.; Eiguren-Fernandez, Arantzazu; Hering, Susanne; Fan, Z.

Evaluations of an inactivated whole virus vaccine in ferrets and nonhuman primates and a virus-like-particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited an immunopathologic-type lung disease. DESIGN: Four candidate vaccines for humans with or without alum adjuvant were evaluated in a mouse model of SARS, a VLP vaccine, the vaccine given to ferrets and NHP, another whole virus vaccine and an rDNA-produced S protein. Balb/c or C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated IM on day 0 and 28 and sacrificed for serum antibody measurements or challenged with live virus on day 56. On day 58, challenged mice were sacrificed and lungs obtained for virus and histopathology. RESULTS: All vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody with increasing dosages and/or alum significantly increasing responses. Significant reductions of SARS-CoV two days after challenge was seen for all vaccines and prior live SARS-CoV. All mice exhibited histopathologic changes in lungs two days after challenge including all animals vaccinated (Balb/C and C57BL/6) or given live virus, influenza vaccine, or PBS suggesting infection occurred in all. Histopathology seen in animals given one of the SARS-CoV vaccines was uniformly a Th2-type immunopathology with prominent eosinophil infiltration, confirmed with special eosinophil stains. The pathologic changes seen in all control groups lacked the eosinophil prominence. CONCLUSIONS: These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.","publish_time":"2012-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tseng, Chien-Te; Sbrana, Elena; Iwata-Yoshikawa, Naoko; Newman, Patrick C.; Garron, Tania; Atmar, Robert L.; Peters, Clarence J.; Couch, Robert B.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/962c58e6dc9c1ea550eb51ce70b0d7c83dc7eff6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3335060.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PBS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV vaccines","virus vaccine","SARS-CoV components","SARS coronavirus","prior live SARS-CoV","VLP vaccine","influenza vaccine","particle vaccine","vaccine development","live virus","mouse model of SARS","Significant reductions of SARS","challenge of mice","candidate vaccines","induced antibody","infection","animals","Th2-type immunopathology","protection","ferrets","days","serum antibody measurements","eosinophil prominence","C57BL","lungs","humans","Balb","histopathology","prominent eosinophil infiltration","special eosinophil stains","occurrence of Th2","immunopathologic-type lung disease","histopathologic changes","control groups","alum adjuvant","increasing dosages","vaccinated IM","hypersensitivity","deliberate release","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","application","nonhuman primates","BACKGROUND","rDNA","PBS","NHP","concern","reemergence","proceeding","DESIGN","Evaluations","CONCLUSIONS","S protein","Caution","China","RESULTS","countries","responses"],"language":"en"},

Hence, this study aimed to identify biomarkers that may be used to distinguish refractory and common pneumonias caused by MP in children at hospital admission. METHODS: The study included 123 children divided into five groups according to infection agent and treatment protocol: Group I included those with MP infection without documented viral infection, treated with only macrolides; Group II included those with MP infection without documented viral infection, treated with a combination of macrolides and methylprednisolone; Group III included those with MP infection and documented viral infection, treated with only macrolides; Group IV included those with viral pneumonia without documented MP infection; Group V was the control group composed of admitted children without MP or a documented viral infection. These five groups were further subdivided into Groups A (including Groups I, III, IV, and V) and B (Group II) according to the responses to macrolide treatment. Concentrations of cytokines interleukin 6, interleukin 17, interleukin 18, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1, and lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin of all children were evaluated, and these levels were compared among the groups. Statistical comparisons were made using Kruskal Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Serum lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 18, and ferritin concentrations were significantly higher in Group II than in Groups I, III, IV, and V and were significantly higher in Group B than in Group A. When the serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration was 350 IU/L or higher, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing refractory MP pneumonia were 73 and 80%, respectively. When the interleukin 18 level was 360 pg/mL or higher, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing refractory MP pneumonia were 93 and 70%, respectively. When the ferritin level was 230 pg/mL or higher, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing refractory MP pneumonia were 67 and 67%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 18, and ferritin constitute the critical combination of biomarkers useful for predicting refractory MP pneumonia in children at hospital admission.","publish_time":"2019-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Young-Jin; Jeon, Ju-Hee; Oh, Jae-Won","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9702e48b8bce2e6a2e17f0252dbf5c1b0958b9f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6706904.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443650/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-019-1152-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Group III","Group IV","Group","IU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["documented MP infection","refractory MP pneumonia","Group V","Group IV","documented viral infection","Group B","groups","control group","viral pneumonia","infection agent","responses of refractory","specificity","serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration","admitted children","Concentrations of cytokines interleukin","sensitivity","combination of macrolides","ferritin concentrations","ferritin level","RESULTS","hospital admission","pg","study","critical combination of biomarkers useful","common pneumonias","treatment protocol","macrolide treatment","Kruskal Wallis test","common Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Mann-Whitney U test","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","IU","Statistical comparisons","methylprednisolone","CONCLUSION","METHODS","levels","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

First utilized in the rapid diagnosis of smallpox, it developed to a diagnostic routine in the early 1960s using the negative staining technique. EM was applied to infected cell-cultures and also to \u2018dirty\u2019 specimens including urine, feces, vesicle fluid, liquor. With the implementation of molecular biological and genetic techniques, the use of diagnostic EM decreased. Objectives: (1) To give a perspective on future indications and possible uses by discussing the past and the present of diagnostic EM, (2) To describe the system of External Quality Assessment on EM virus diagnosis (EQA-EMV) established in 1994 by our laboratory and its achievements. Study design: EQA-EMV is run to evaluate, to confirm and to improve the quality of diagnostic EM. Two different types of specimen are sent out: (1) prepared grids to assess and train the diagnostic skills of the participants, (2) stabilized virus particle suspensions to assess preparation efficiency. Results: Diagnostic EM differs from other diagnostic tests in its rapidity and its undirected \u2018open view\u2019. To emphasize these advantages, the indications for diagnostic EM are discussed, fundamental for a continuing future adaptation. Besides appropriate techniques, quality control measures are required to achieve and keep high diagnostic standards. The results from 6 years of EQA-EMV are presented. Conclusions: In the history of diagnostic EM in virology, a change in use has been seen. Starting in the 1990s and coincident with the broad introduction of \u2018modern\u2019 diagnostic techniques, the number of EM diagnostic labs has decreased considerably\u2014in spite of the obvious advantages of this technique. To guarantee the continuing performance of diagnostic EM in the future, EQA runs have to be performed as with other techniques in the diagnostic armament. The growing number of participants and participating countries indicates an interest in as well as a need for this program.","publish_time":"1999-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Biel, Stefan S.; Gelderblom, Hans R.","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb0a6f6ded1a53b699f8a704fb5155b445e6987c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128371.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665329900027X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665329900027X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["External Quality Assessment"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quality of diagnostic EM","diagnostic techniques","use of diagnostic EM","history of diagnostic EM","present of diagnostic EM","diagnostic tests","diagnostic routine","diagnostic skills","diagnostic armament","number of EM diagnostic labs","continuing performance of diagnostic EM","high diagnostic standards","EM virus diagnosis","EQA-EMV","genetic techniques","appropriate techniques","future indications","years of EQA","continuing future adaptation","Results","growing number of participants","quality control measures","system of External Quality Assessment","clinical virology","obvious advantages","virus particle suspensions","rapid diagnosis of smallpox","negative staining technique","feces","important tool","broad introduction","urine","possible uses","rapidity","vesicle fluid","technical development","implementation of molecular biological","specimens","preparation efficiency","participating countries","perspective","change","Abstract Background","electron microscopy","open view","liquor","spite","infected cell-cultures","Study design","different types of specimen","Conclusions","prepared grids","laboratory","achievements","need","program","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Surprisingly, only SERPINe1-derived 14-mer peptide and low molecular weight drugs targeting SERPINe1 (i.e. tannic acid, EGCG, tiplaxtinin) inhibited in vitro infections not only of VHSV, but also of other fish rhabdoviruses such as infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and spring viremia carp virus (SVCV). While the mechanisms that inhibited rhabdoviral infections remain speculative, these and other results suggested that SERPINEe1-derived peptide specifically targeted viral infectivity rather than virions. Practical applications might be developed from these studies since preliminary evidences showed that tannic acid could be used to reduce VHSV-caused mortalities.

The acute episode is characterized by deterioration in consciousness, often with focal neurologic deficits and seizures. Additionally, symmetric multifocal brain lesions are seen in the bilateral thalami as well as other characteristic regions, involving both gray and white matter. Prognosis is variable, with a high mortality rate and most surviving patients having persistent neurologic deficits. Early treatment with high dose steroids is associated with a more favorable outcome, however the diagnosis is often overlooked resulting in delayed treatment. The RANBP2 mutation associated with ANE1 causes an incompletely penetrant predisposition to encephalopathy in the setting of febrile illness through a mechanism that remains elusive. There are several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses suggesting possible etiologies for this phenotype based on the many functions of RANBP2 within the cell. These include dysfunctions in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and intracellular metabolic regulation, as well as cytokine storm, and abnormal distribution of mitochondria. This narrative review explores these key concepts of the RANBP2 mutation and its clinical and therapeutic implications in pediatric populations.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Levine, Jesse M.; Ahsan, Nusrat; Ho, Eugenia; Santoro, Jonathan D.","journal":"Multiple sclerosis and related disorders","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c0b4ce969b2469e43d87d531e87287f00a87426f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034820302704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426208/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820302704?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102194","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAN Binding Protein"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RANBP2 mutation","functions of RANBP2","ANE1","missense mutation","acute necrotizing encephalopathy","genetic predisposition","setting of febrile illness","focal neurologic deficits","persistent neurologic deficits","surviving patients","preceding viral febrile illness","penetrant predisposition","Early treatment","acute episode","delayed treatment","high mortality rate","high dose steroids","intracellular metabolic regulation","therapeutic implications","possible etiologies","cytokine storm","nucleocytoplasmic trafficking","consciousness","RAN Binding Protein","key concepts","exclusive hypotheses","characteristic regions","bilateral thalami","phenotype","dysfunctions","pediatric populations","deterioration","mechanism","rare disease","symmetric multifocal brain lesions","abnormal distribution of mitochondria","diagnosis","narrative review","seizures","favorable outcome","white matter","Prognosis"],"language":"en"},

Similarly, it has become clear that, Europe wide, one has witnessed only limited success with regard to the control of important food-borne agents such as Salmonella spp. The European Union has adopted legislation to remedy this situation and to control food-borne zoonoses in primary production. This contribution discusses the incentives for introducing EU Directive 2003/99/EC and EU Regulation No. 2160/2003, summarises their essentials and discusses major ramifications of both pieces of legislation for the prevention of food-borne zoonoses.

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab or sputum specimens were collected from children aged 19 days to 15 years who were admitted to a hospital in Shanghai and diagnosed with RTIs. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex PCR assay that detects 16 viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae). RESULTS: Among the 775 children studied, 626 (80.8%, 626/775) tested positive for at least one organism, and multiple organisms were detected in 198 (25.5%). Rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (25.5%, 198/775) were detected most often, followed by respiratory syncytial virus (19.5%, 151/775), parainfluenza virus 3 (14.8%, 115/775), influenza A or B (10.9%), adenovirus (10.8%), M. pneumoniae (10.6%) and B. pertussis (6.3%). The prevalence of organisms differed by age, and most of the viruses were more common in winter. Of the 140 children suspected of having pertussis, 35.0% (49/140) tested positive for B. pertussis.

The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death. Forty-eight (20.6%) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33-47) died during the follow-up. Most were males (69.1%) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50-72). The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7% (95% CI 14.6-24.9%) 30 days after hospital admission.

We therefore explored the association between age, respiratory viruses, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and cytokines/chemokines in acute exacerbations of childhood asthma. Methods We investigated viruses in nasal secretions from 88 patients with acute exacerbation of childhood asthma by using antigen detection kits and/or RT-PCR, followed by direct DNA sequencing analysis. We also measured peripheral eosinophil counts, and the serum levels of ECP and 27 types of cytokines/chemokines in 71 virus-induced acute asthma cases and 13 controls. Results Viruses were detected in 71(80.7%) of the 88 samples. The three major viruses detected were rhinoviruses, RS viruses, and enteroviruses; enteroviruses were found to be dominant in patients aged \u22653 years. There was no change in the levels of rhinoviruses and RS viruses between the two age groups, defined as children aged \u003C3 years and children aged \u22653 years. Serum concentrations of ECP, IL-5, and IP-10 were significantly elevated in virus-induced acute asthma cases compared with controls. Serum ECP values were significantly higher in patients with virus-induced asthma at age \u22653 years compared with those aged \u003C3 years. Among the 27 cytokines/chemokines, serum IP-10 was significantly higher in virus-induced asthma in patients \u003C3 years than in those \u22653 years. Serum ECP and IL-5 production correlated significantly with age, whereas serum IP-10 showed an inverse correlation with age. Conclusions Age-related differences in cytokine profiles and eosinophil activation may be related to virus-induced acute exacerbations of childhood asthma.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kato, Masahiko; Suzuki, Kazuo; Yamada, Yoshiyuki; Maruyama, Kenichi; Hayashi, Yasuhide; Mochizuki, Hiroyuki","journal":"Allergology International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b60020c52271ad90216c7d6f5f2889285eff786.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110814.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1323893015001458; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1323893015001458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26344082/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alit.2015.06.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["years","virus-induced asthma","acute asthma cases","serum IP","serum levels of ECP","acute exacerbations of childhood asthma","bronchial asthma","Serum ECP values","Serum concentrations of ECP","acute exacerbation of childhood asthma","RS viruses","patients","respiratory viruses","major viruses","age groups","Results Viruses","serum eosinophil cationic protein","eosinophil activation","chemokines","cytokine profiles","peripheral eosinophil counts","levels of rhinoviruses","types of cytokines","enteroviruses","children","controls","antigen detection kits","nasal secretions","Abstract Background Little information","RT-PCR","Conclusions Age-related differences","direct DNA sequencing analysis","production","inverse correlation","Methods","association","change","samples"],"language":"en"},

Despite this, there is a paucity of information regarding the immunological mechanisms by which bats coexist with highly pathogenic viruses. Immunoglobulins are major components of the adaptive immune system. Early studies found bats may have quantitatively lower antibody responses to model antigens compared to conventional laboratory animals. To further understand the antibody response of bats, the present study purified and characterised the major immunoglobulin classes from healthy black flying foxes, Pteropus alecto. We employed a novel strategy, where IgG was initially purified and used to generate anti-Fab specific antibodies. Immobilised anti-Fab specific antibodies were then used to capture other immunoglobulins from IgG depleted serum. While high quantities of IgM were successfully isolated from serum, IgA was not. Only trace quantities of IgA were detected in the serum by mass spectrometry. Immobilised ligands specific to IgA (Jacalin, Peptide M and staphylococcal superantigen-like protein) also failed to capture P. alecto IgA from serum. IgM was the second most abundant serum antibody after IgG. A survey of mucosal secretions found IgG was the dominant antibody class rather than IgA. Our study demonstrates healthy P. alecto bats have markedly less serum IgA than expected. Higher quantities of IgG in mucosal secretions may be compensation for this low abundance or lack of IgA. Knowledge and reagents developed within this study can be used in the future to examine class-specific antibody response within this important viral host.","publish_time":"2013-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wynne, James W.; Di Rubbo, Antonio; Shiell, Brian J.; Beddome, Gary; Cowled, Christopher; Peck, Grantley R.; Huang, Jing; Grimley, Samantha L.; Baker, Michelle L.; Michalski, Wojtek P.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcd9208e1cff6a9d5e3af17745299ceea1479529.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3538733.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23308125/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052930","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["serum IgA","alecto IgA","antibody response of bats","alecto bats","abundant serum antibody","IgG depleted serum","lack of IgA","trace quantities of IgA","class-specific antibody response","Higher quantities of IgG","dominant antibody class","Immobilised anti-Fab specific antibodies","lower antibody responses","Immobilised ligands specific","Pteropus alecto","present study","Immunoglobulins","high quantities of IgM","survey of mucosal secretions","major components","viral agents","major immunoglobulin classes","important viral host","conventional laboratory animals","healthy black flying foxes","model antigens","Jacalin","compensation","long list of emerging","dissemination","Peptide","low abundance","adaptive immune system","staphylococcal superantigen","death","illnesses","future","overwhelming body of evidence","paucity of information","immunological mechanisms","Early studies","protein","humans","Knowledge","reagents","novel strategy","mass spectrometry","pathogenic viruses"],"language":"en"},

A case of acquisition of a completely new protein through introduction of a start codon in an alternative reading frame is the protein encoded by open reading frame (orf) 9b of SARS coronavirus. This gene completely overlaps with the nucleocapsid (N) gene (orf9a). Our findings indicate that the orf9b gene features a discordant codon-usage pattern. We analyzed the evolution of orf9b in concert with orf9a using sequence data of betacoronavirus-lineage b and found that orf9b, which encodes the overprinting protein, evolved largely independent of the overprinted orf9a. We also examined the protein products of these genomic sequences for their structural flexibility and found that it is not necessary for a newly acquired, overlapping protein product to be intrinsically disordered, in contrast to earlier suggestions.

The transmembrane protein CD26 with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) activity shows an increased expression in inflamed tissue. We tested whether CD26/DPP4 deficiency leads to reduced inflammation and decreased structural damage when infected with PA. METHODS: CD26/DPP4(\u002B) and CD26/DPP4(\u2212) rats were instilled intratracheally with NaCl (controls) or with PA. Six hours later, bacterial distribution was detected with the in vivo imaging system 200 (IVIS). Lungs were then processed for molecular biology, light and electron microscopy and analyzed qualitatively, quantitatively and stereologically. Bacterial numbers were determined in homogenized lungs. RESULTS: Compared to saline treated controls, in both infected groups (1) the acinar airspace was significantly increased, (2) the volume density of the alveolar epithelium was significantly decreased, (3) the septal thickness was significantly reduced, (4) more than 40% of the alveolar epithelial surface was damaged, and up to 36% of the epithelial surface was covered with edema. In infected CD26(\u2212) rats, the increase in lung weight was significantly less pronounced, the portion of edematous alveolar airspace was significantly lower and the part of edema interspersed with PA was decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: CD26/DPP4 deficiency resulted in reduced pulmonary edema under sublethal PA infection, implicating a role for CD26 in infection progression.

The constructed BHK-Tet-SARS-N cell strains will facilitate the rescue of SARS-CoV in vitro and the further reverse genetic research of SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2010-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Guo-hui; Dividson, Andrew; Lin, Lei; Wilson, Matt; Siddell, Stuart G.; Zhu, Qing-yu","journal":"Virol Sin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbe266362b2fc364035da1fb73381f4c7f240bbf.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20960182/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12250-010-3124-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of SARS","Tight-SARS","nucleocapsid gene of SARS","rescue of SARS","SARS-N cell strains","inducible control of SARS","SARS-CoV neucleocapsid gene expression","CoV nucleocapsid gene expression","CoV nucleocapsid protein","reverse genetic research of SARS","CoV HKU","constructed BHK-Tet","stable eukaryotic cell lines","recombinant plasmid of pTRE","constructed double-stable cell line","cotransfecting pTRE-Tight","Positive cell clones","sequence analysis","plasmid p8S","set of double","optimized nucleotide sequence","Western-blot analysis","cDNA clone","linear marker pPUR","PCR template","SDS-PAGE","Restriction enzymes digestion","varying concentration of doxcycline","cells","order","presence of puromycin","translation efficiency"],"language":"en"},

Sixteen viral non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) constitute an unusually large replicase complex, which includes two methyltransferases putatively involved in viral mRNA cap formation. The S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity was recently attributed to nsp14, whereas nsp16 has been predicted to be the AdoMet-dependent (nucleoside-2\u2032O)-methyltransferase. Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation in vitro. We show that mRNA cap methylation requires a third viral protein, nsp10, which acts as an essential trigger to complete RNA cap-1 formation. The obligate sequence of methylation events is initiated by nsp14, which first methylates capped RNA transcripts to generate cap-0 (7Me)GpppA-RNAs. The latter are then selectively 2\u2032O-methylated by the 2\u2032O-MTase nsp16 in complex with its activator nsp10 to give rise to cap-1 (7Me)GpppA(2\u2032OMe)-RNAs. Furthermore, sensitive in vitro inhibition assays of both activities show that aurintricarboxylic acid, active in SARS-CoV infected cells, targets both MTases with IC(50) values in the micromolar range, providing a validated basis for anti-coronavirus drug design.","publish_time":"2010-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bouvet, Micka\u00EBl; Debarnot, Claire; Imbert, Isabelle; Selisko, Barbara; Snijder, Eric J.; Canard, Bruno; Decroly, Etienne","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5484795b90c22596ead5f0b9ccf08d95a3e6f5c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2858705.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20421945/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000863","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral mRNA cap formation","complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation","complete RNA cap","SARS-coronavirus","viral proteins","O-MTase nsp16","SARS-CoV infected cells","viral non-structural proteins","N7-MTase","synthesis","AdoMet-dependent","nsp14","GpppA-RNAs","capped RNA transcripts","activator nsp10","guanine-N7","obligate sequence of methylation events","large replicase complex","anti-coronavirus drug design","validated basis","activities","MTases","targets","aurintricarboxylic acid","methyltransferases","essential trigger","genome expression","values","micromolar range","methionine","activity","inhibition assays","rise","nucleoside","S-adenosyl","set of mRNAs"],"language":"en"},

Methods: A total of 487 infants were recruited at birth for the Asthma Multicenter Infant Cohort Study in Barcelona (Spain). Cases of LRTIs were ascertained through an active register including a home visit and viral test in nasal lavage specimens during the first year of life. Cotinine in cord blood, household aeroallergens, indoor NO(2) and maternal and neonatal IgE were measured. Other maternal and infants\u0027 characteristics were obtained from structured questionnaires. Results: The incidence rate of at least one LRTI was 38.7 infants per 100 persons\u2010years. The most frequently isolated viral agent was respiratory syncytial virus (44.7%). The risk of LRTIs was higher in infants with a maternal history of asthma and in those with siblings (OR = 2.4; 95% CI: 0.98\u20136.08 and OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.04\u20133.21, respectively).

In this study, we coupled 15 highly conserved immunodominant CTL epitope peptides derived from hepatitis C virus (HCV) to the surface of liposomes. We also emulsified the peptides in incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant, and compared the immune responses of the two methods of presenting the peptides by cytotoxicity induction and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03B3) production by CD8\u002B T cells of the immunized mice. We noticed significant variations of the immunogenicity of each peptide between the two antigen delivery systems. In addition, the immunogenicity profiles of the peptides were also different from those observed in the mice infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing HCV proteins as previously reported. Induction of anti-viral immunity by liposomal peptides was tested by the challenge experiments using recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing corresponding HCV epitopes. One Db-restricted and three HLA-A*0201-restricted HCV CTL epitope peptides on the surface of liposomes were found to confer complete protection to immunized mice with establishment of long-term memory. Interestingly, their protective efficacy seemed to correlate with the induction of IFN-\u03B3 producing cells rather than the cytotoxicity induction suggesting that the immunized mice were protected through non-cytolytic mechanisms. Thus, these liposomal peptides might be useful as HCV vaccines not only for prevention but also for therapeutic use.","publish_time":"2013-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takagi, Akira; Kobayashi, Nobuharu; Taneichi, Maiko; Uchida, Tetsuya; Akatsuka, Toshitaka","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae508e0c926147281503c01cd5206ee3e0929d33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124229.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X12021894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23159619/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X12021894","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["liposomal peptides","immunized mice","restricted HCV CTL epitope peptides","conserved immunodominant CTL epitope peptides","Liposomal form of immunodominant CTL epitope peptides","HCV vaccines","HCV proteins","cytotoxicity induction","induction of IFN","surface of liposomes","T cells","corresponding HCV epitopes","efficient antiviral CTL responses","IFN-\u03B3","Induction of anti-viral immunity","recombinant adenoviruses","immune responses","immunogenicity profiles","Db-restricted","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","hepatitis C virus","recombinant vaccinia viruses","cytotoxic T lymphocytes","antigen delivery systems","challenge experiments","production","interferon-gamma","CD8","unsaturated fatty acids","prevention","CTLs","incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant","complete protection","methods","establishment of long-term memory","non-cytolytic mechanisms","HLA","significant variations","therapeutic use","addition","protective efficacy","study","antigens"],"language":"en"},

Lack of a microbiological diagnosis impairs precision treatment in CAP. METHODS: Specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract of 195 CAP patients, viruses were measured by the Single-plex real-time PCR assay and the conventional culture method was exploited for bacteria. RESULTS: Among the 195 patients, there were 46 (23.59%) pure bacterial infections, 20 (10.26%) yeast infections, 32 (16.41%) pure viral infections, 8 (4.10%) viral-yeast co-infections, and 17 (8.72%) viral-bacterial co-infections. The two most abundant bacteria were Acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas the most common virus was influenza A. CONCLUSIONS: Non-influenza respiratory microorganisms frequently co-circulated during the epidemic peaks of influenza, which easily being ignored in CAP therapy. In patients with bacterial and viral co-infections, identifying the etiologic agent is crucial for patient\u2019s therapy.","publish_time":"2019-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Chun; Chen, Huanzhu; He, Ping; Li, Yazhen; Ke, Changwen; Jiao, Xiaoyang","journal":"Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f8e16a79fd881da1c8255be5a98120ced75b5e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172155.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174691/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147957119300499; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147957119300499; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2019.03.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral co-infections","viral-bacterial co-infections","viral-yeast co-infections","pure viral infections","yeast infections","pure bacterial infections","CAP patients","hospital patients","CAP therapy","Non-influenza respiratory microorganisms","epidemic peaks of influenza","abundant bacteria","patient\u2019s therapy","lower respiratory tract","CONCLUSIONS","etiologic agent","Single-plex real-time PCR assay","klebsiella pneumoniae","conventional culture method","Specimens","precision treatment","METHODS","Acinetobacter baumannii","common virus","microbiological diagnosis","viruses","etiology of community","limited pathogen detection","Lack","PURPOSE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In the virulent Miller strain of TGEV, ORF 3b is 5\u2032-terminal on mRNA 3\u20131 and is presumably translated following 5\u2032 cap-dependent ribosomal entry. For three other strains of TGEV, the virulent British FS772/70 and Taiwanese TFI and avirulent Purdue-116, mRNA species 3\u20131 is not made and ORF 3b is present as a non-overlapping second ORF on mRNA 3. ORF 3b begins at base 432 on mRNA 3 in Purdue strain. In vitro expression of ORF 3b from Purdue mRNA 3-like transcripts did not fully conform to a predicted leaky scanning pattern, suggesting ribosomes might also be entering internally. With mRNA 3-like transcripts modified to carry large ORFs upstream of ORF 3a, it was demonstrated that ribosomes can reach ORF 3b by entering at a distant downstream site in a manner resembling ribosomal shunting. Deletion analysis failed to identify a postulated internal ribosomal entry structure (IRES) within ORF 3a. The results indicate that an internal entry mechanism, possibly in conjunction with leaky scanning, is used for the expression of ORF 3b from TGEV mRNA 3. One possible consequence of this feature is that ORF 3b might also be expressed from mRNAs 1 and 2.","publish_time":"2000-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Connor, Jennifer Black; Brian, David A.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96454b22b4c649398a3d7763603fec0faa9beb4f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682200902186; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682200902186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF","TGEV"],"locations":["Purdue"],"keyphrases":["expression of ORF","TGEV mRNA","Purdue mRNA","mRNA species","strains of TGEV","Purdue strain","virulent Miller strain of TGEV","kDa","postulated internal ribosomal entry structure","internal entry mechanism","avirulent Purdue","cap-dependent ribosomal entry","ribosomal shunting","ribosomes","transcripts","predicted leaky scanning pattern","virulent British FS772","IRES","porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus","Taiwanese TFI","putative nonstructural polypeptide","unknown function","manner","conjunction","glycosylated integral membrane protein","non-overlapping","distant downstream site","translation","feature","base","Abstract Gene","results","large ORFs","Deletion analysis","possible consequence","terminal","mRNAs"],"language":"en"},

Influenza virus due to its wide host range and zoonotic potential poses such a significant threat to public health. Swine serve as a \u0022mixing vessel\u0022 for influenza virus reassortment and evolution which as a result may facilitate the emergence of new strains or subtypes of zoonotic potential. In this context, the currently available scientific data hold a high significance to unravel influenza virus epidemiology and evolution. With this objective, the current systematic review summarizes the original research articles and case reports of all the four types of influenza viruses reported in swine populations worldwide. A total of 281 articles were found eligible through screening of PubMed and Google Scholar databases and hence were included in this systematic review. The highest number of research articles (n = 107) were reported from Asia, followed by Americas (n = 97), Europe (n = 55), Africa (n = 18), and Australia (n = 4). The H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were the most common influenza A virus subtypes reported in swine in most countries across the globe, however, few strains of influenza B, C, and D viruses were also reported in certain countries. Multiple reports of the avian influenza virus strains documented in the last two decades in swine in China, the United States, Canada, South Korea, Nigeria, and Egypt provided the evidence of interspecies transmission of influenza viruses from birds to swine. Inter-species transmission of equine influenza virus H3N8 from horse to swine in China expanded the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses. Additionally, numerous reports of the double and triple-reassortant strains which emerged due to reassortments among avian, human, and swine strains within swine further increased the genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses. These findings are alarming hence active surveillance should be in place to prevent future influenza pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chauhan, Ravendra P; Gordon, Michelle L","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397138/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9050355","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Americas"],"locations":["Asia","Europe","Australia","United States","Canada","South Korea","Nigeria","China"],"keyphrases":["swine strains","influenza virus reassortment","influenza virus epidemiology","avian influenza virus strains","common influenza","genetic diversity of swine influenza viruses","types of influenza viruses","strains of influenza B","swine populations","future influenza pandemics","virus subtypes","evidence of interspecies transmission of influenza viruses","Inter-species transmission of equine influenza virus H3N8","D viruses","pdm09 viruses","zoonotic virus diseases of pandemic potential","subtypes of zoonotic potential","emergence of new strains","triple-reassortant strains","China","original research articles","significant threat","case reports","active surveillance","public health","Multiple reports","numerous reports","current systematic review","evolution","H1N1","highest number of research articles","current COVID","certain countries","high significance","South Korea","Canada","Egypt","United States","horse","screening of PubMed","wide host range","available scientific data","Nigeria","need","place","mixing vessel","human","birds","Google Scholar databases","result","reassortments","global anxiety","context","H3N2","objective","globe","decades","H1N2","total","findings","Asia","Americas","Europe","Africa","Australia"],"language":"en"},

Once the RNA molecules have successfully entered the target cells, they could inhibit the expression of specific gene sequence through RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism and generate therapeutic effects. The biggest obstacle to translating siRNA therapy from the laboratories into the clinics is delivery. An ideal delivery agent should protect the siRNA from enzymatic degradation, facilitate cellular uptake and promote endosomal escape inside the cells, with negligible toxicity. Lung targeting could be achieved by systemic delivery or pulmonary delivery. The latter route of administration could potentially enhance siRNA retention in the lungs and reduce systemic toxic effects. However the presence of mucus, the mucociliary clearance actions and the high degree branching of the airways present major barriers to targeted pulmonary delivery. The delivery systems need to be designed carefully in order to maximize the siRNA deposition to the diseased area of the airways. In most of the pulmonary siRNA therapy studies in vivo, siRNA was delivered either intratracheally or intranasally. Very limited work was done on the formulation of siRNA for inhalation which is believed to be the direction for future development. This review focuses on the latest development of pulmonary delivery of siRNA for the treatment of various lung diseases.","publish_time":"2012-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lam, Jenny Ka-Wing; Liang, Wanling; Chan, Hak-Kim","journal":"Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b4f6501ac34ce2350bcdb121130247e2523d928.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103329.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169409X11000408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21356260/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addr.2011.02.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X11000408","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["formulation of siRNA","siRNA deposition","siRNA retention","latest development of pulmonary delivery of siRNA","systemic delivery","pulmonary siRNA therapy studies","delivery systems","ideal delivery agent","treatment of various lung diseases","RNA interference","RNA molecules","prevention of various lung diseases","Lung targeting","systemic toxic effects","Abstract Small interfering RNA","target cells","therapeutic effects","future development","airways present major barriers","RNAi","high degree","mucociliary clearance actions","cellular uptake","expression of specific gene sequence","mechanism","lungs","endosomal escape","enzymatic degradation","huge potential","diseased area","laboratories","presence of mucus","clinics","biggest obstacle","negligible toxicity","route of administration","limited work","direction","review","inhalation","order"],"language":"en"},

Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from patients with pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the etiology (1). As of February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had been identified in China and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other countries, including 11 in the United States (2,3). On January 17, CDC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u0027s Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City (4). CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection (2). As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection. Guided by CDC criteria for the evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs) (5), 210 symptomatic persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among these persons, 148 (70%) had travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both travel- and contact-related risks. Eleven of these persons had laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Recognizing persons at risk for 2019-nCoV is critical to identifying cases and preventing further transmission. Health care providers should remain vigilant and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices when evaluating patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection (6).

In light of the variable success in protecting health care workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, organizational and individual factors related to self-protective behavior in health care settings may also play an important role. Methods A critical review of the literature was conducted, directed at understanding what organizational and individual factors are important in protecting HCWs from infectious diseases at work. Results Organizational factors, such as a positive safety climate, have been associated with increased HCW adherence to universal precautions. There is some evidence that appropriate training of HCWs could be effective in changing HCW behavior if appropriate follow-up is applied. Very little research into these factors has been conducted with regard to preventing exposures to respiratory tract pathogens, but there was evidence from the SARS outbreaks that training programs and the availability of adequate PPE were associated with a decrease risk of infection. Conclusion Variations in organizational and individual factors can explain much of the variations in self-protective behavior in health care settings. It is likely that these factors were also important determinants during the SARS outbreaks, but they have not been extensively studied.","publish_time":"2005-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moore, David; Gamage, Bruce; Bryce, Elizabeth; Copes, Ray; Yassi, Annalee; other members of The BC Interdisciplinary Respirat,","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65f65eebae12ff976b0373b64a6b5e78be3f0878.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115321.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655304006406; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655304006406","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","SARS","Conclusion Variations"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Organizational factors","individual factors","health care settings","self-protective behavior","SARS outbreaks","health care workers","appropriate training of HCWs","changing HCW behavior","important determinants","important role","evidence","appropriate follow-up","Conclusion Variations","increased HCW adherence","respiratory tract pathogens","availability of adequate PPE","decrease risk of infection","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Background Traditional infection control policies","specific protocols","engineering controls","personal protective equipment","variable success","programs","literature","universal precautions","exposures","infectious diseases","regard","understanding","positive safety climate","Methods","critical review","light","little research"],"language":"en"},

Dimerization of this enzyme has been shown to be indispensable for transcleavage activity. However, the auto-processing mechanism of M(pro), i.e. its own release from the polyproteins through autocleavage, remains unclear. This study elucidates the relationship between the N-terminal autocleavage activity and the dimerization of \u201Cimmature\u201D M(pro). Three residues (Arg4, Glu290, and Arg298), which contribute to the active dimer conformation of mature M(pro), are selected for mutational analyses. Surprisingly, all three mutants still perform N-terminal autocleavage, while the dimerization of mature protease and transcleavage activity following auto-processing are completely inhibited by the E290R and R298E mutations and partially so by the R4E mutation. Furthermore, the mature E290R mutant can resume N-terminal autocleavage activity when mixed with the \u201Cimmature\u201D C145A/E290R double mutant whereas its trans-cleavage activity remains absent. Therefore, the N-terminal auto-processing of M(pro) appears to require only two \u201Cimmature\u201D monomers approaching one another to form an \u201Cintermediate\u201D dimer structure and does not strictly depend on the active dimer conformation existing in mature protease. In conclusion, an auto-release model of M(pro) from the polyproteins is proposed, which will help understand the auto-processing mechanism and the difference between the autocleavage and trans-cleavage proteolytic activities of SARS-CoV M(pro).","publish_time":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Shuai; Jonas, Felix; Shen, Can; Higenfeld, Rolf","journal":"Protein \u0026 Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f8e0d70730cbfd33cab862eb8f6e3d333d62fca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21203998/; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13238-010-0011-4.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-010-0011-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N-terminal autocleavage activity","N-terminal auto-processing","auto-processing mechanism","transcleavage activity","proteolytic processing","dimerization of mature protease","trans-cleavage activity","mature E290R mutant","polyproteins","active dimer conformation of mature","auto-release model","SARS-CoV","trans-cleavage proteolytic activities of SARS","E290R double mutant","main protease","dimer structure","replicative cycle of SARS coronavirus","difference","vital role","C145A","relationship","Arg4","Glu290","conclusion","mutants","R298E mutations","residues","Arg298","enzyme","study","R4E mutation","mutational analyses","monomers"],"language":"en"},

This suggests that (a) extensive nicking of a large RNA molecule has occurred during viral growth, due to ribonucleases which are inactivated during phenol extractions; (b) heterogeneity for OC-43 RNA is not due to internal ribonuclease activity and fragments are held together by noncovalent linkages much weaker than those present in the 70 S retroviral RNA complex, or by small proteins; or, most probably, (c) a combination of extensive nicking and weak noncovalent linkages results in the heterogeneous denaturation products.","publish_time":"1977-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tannock, Gregory A.; Hierholzer, John C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6e753f1d598feaca24c0a19464fe7e2c503cc31.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268227790126X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268227790126X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S RNA fragments","S retroviral RNA complex","homogeneous RNA complex","large RNA molecule","Rous sarcoma virus RNA","phenol-SDS","range of fragments","phenol-chloroform","derived OC","phenol extractions","tobacco mosaic virus","combination of extensive nicking","weak noncovalent linkages results","treatment","sedimentation coefficient","heterogeneous denaturation products","heterogeneity","mouse-brain","viral growth","sodium dodecyl sulfate","ribonucleases","internal ribonuclease activity","small proteins","apparent molecular weight","centrifugation","dimethyl sulfoxide gradients","coefficients","minor component"],"language":"en"},

The coverage rate of influenza vaccination for this age group was suboptimal at 8.5 % in 2012/13. This study investigates the factors associated with the uptake of influenza vaccination among adults in Hong Kong aged 50\u201364 years. METHODS: A case\u2013control study was conducted in communities by street intercept interviews from 17 July to 15 August 2013. Cases were adults aged 50\u201364 years who had received the influenza vaccine in 2011/12 or 2012/13, while controls were the same as the cases, except they had not received the influenza vaccine in 2011/12 or 2012/13. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed on the data to explore the associations between vaccination status and the variables. RESULTS: Six hundred and four respondents in total were interviewed and included in the analysis. There were 193 cases (vaccinated) and 411 controls (non-vaccinated), with a case-to-control ratio of 1:2.1. The following were strongly associated with vaccination compared to other factors: \u2018eligible for free government vaccine\u2019 (OR6.38, 95 % CI, 3.43-11.87, p \u003C 0.001); \u2018willing to receive flu vaccination for free\u2019 (OR4.84, 95 % CI, 2.13-11.03, p \u003C 0.001); \u2018perceived having severe or moderate symptoms when contracting flu\u2019 (OR2.90, 95 % CI, 1.21-6.97, p = 0.02), and \u2018convenient to reach a vaccination location\u2019 (OR2.87, 95 % CI, 1.06-7.74, p = 0.04). The majority of the cases (80.8 %) and controls (93.9 %) were not aware that they belonged to a recommended group for influenza vaccination and most (\u003E80 %) were willing to be vaccinated if it was free.

Here, we present three crystal structures of SARS 3CLpro in complex with each of two members of a new class of peptide-based phthalhydrazide inhibitors. Both inhibitors form an unusual thiiranium ring with the nucleophilic sulfur atom of Cys145, trapping the enzyme\u0027s catalytic residues in configurations similar to the intermediate states proposed to exist during the hydrolysis of native substrates. Most significantly, our crystallographic data are consistent with a scenario in which a water molecule, possibly via indirect coordination from the carbonyl oxygen of Thr26, has initiated nucleophilic attack on the enzyme-bound inhibitor.

It may help to understand the biological significance of microsatellites in Ebolavirus and also other virus genomes.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Douyue; Zhang, Hongxi; Peng, Shan; Pan, Saichao; Tan, Zhongyang","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/683a6f462c0061d3ffe7068fe7bd186049e3c884.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092875.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078274/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X19308514; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X19308514; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.04.192","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conserved microsatellites","terminals of Ebolavirus genomes","terminal regions","terminal non-coding regions","Ebolavirus sequences","Abstract Microsatellites","complete genomes","conserved secondary structures","biological significance of microsatellites","conserved stem-loop structures","small intraspecies variations","large interspecific variations","SSRs","results"],"language":"en"},

The complete genome of the strain was sequenced and analyzed. The results show that the genome of QY16 consists of 27,670 nucleotides, excluding poly (A) tail, and that its genome organization is 5\u2019 UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3\u2019 UTR-poly (A) tail. Sequence comparison among QY16 and other IBV strains was conducted and its results demonstrate that the S1 gene of QY16 has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with that of 4/91, and the other part of its genome is highly similar to that of YX10. The results of the phylogenic analysis show that the entire genome of QY16 and most of the QY16 genes are located in the same cluster as those of YX10, except for the S1 gene which is located in the same cluster with that of 4/91. It has been further confirmed by the RDP and SimPlot analysis that QY16 is a recombinant strain deriving from YX10 (as the major parental sequence) and 4/91 (as the minor parental sequence), and that the recombination occurs in a region which includes the 3\u2019-terminal 1b sequence (85 nt) and the 5\u2019-terminal S1 protein gene sequence (1,466 nt). The results of the vaccination-challenge test suggest that QY16 is a nephropathogenic strain of IBV and that the vaccine strains\u2013H120 and 4/91\u2014cannot provide effective protection against it. These results indicate that the continuing evolution of IBV strains by genetic drift and genetic recombination may lead to IBV outbreaks even among the vaccinated chickens in China.","publish_time":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, K.

While a rapid and effective immune response is essential to limit viral spread and mortality, this anti-viral response needs to be tightly regulated in order to limit immune mediated tissue damage. This balance between effective virus control with limited pathology is especially important due to the highly specialized functions and limited regenerative capacity of neurons, which can be targets of direct virus cytolysis or bystander damage. CNS infection with the neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induces an acute encephalomyelitis associated with focal areas of demyelination, which is sustained during viral persistence. Both innate and adaptive immune cells work in coordination to control virus replication. While type I interferons are essential to limit virus spread associated with early mortality, perforin, and interferon-\u03B3 promote further virus clearance in astrocytes/microglia and oligodendrocytes, respectively. Effective control of virus replication is nonetheless associated with tissue damage, characterized by demyelinating lesions. Interestingly, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 limits expansion of tissue lesions during chronic infection without affecting viral persistence. Thus, effective coordination of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is essential during MHV induced encephalomyelitis in order to protect the host against viral infection at a limited cost.","publish_time":"2018-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savarin, Carine; Bergmann, Cornelia C.","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c459e1a77d9256b02b2b9a5460fcfc8b420b753a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6306494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619363/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.03022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective virus control","virus clearance","viral spread","Effective control of virus replication","viral persistence","viral infections","anti-viral response","direct virus cytolysis","effective immune response","CNS infection","immune mediated tissue damage","effective coordination of pro-","neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus","chronic infection","limited pathology","order","limited cost","bystander damage","limits expansion of tissue lesions","MHV induced encephalomyelitis","adaptive immune cells","anti-inflammatory cytokines","acute encephalomyelitis","early mortality","limited regenerative capacity of neurons","demyelinating lesions","anti-inflammatory cytokine IL","specialized functions","herpes viruses","interferon-\u03B3","arboviruses","astrocytes","perforin","host","focal areas of demyelination","microglia","balance","central nervous system","oligodendrocytes","HIV","interferons"],"language":"en"},

It is expressed on the cell surface and contains a tyrosine-based sorting motif and a di-acidic motif, which may be crucial for its intracellular trafficking. However the role of these motifs is not fully understood in the case of 3a protein. METHODS: The subcellular distribution of the 3a protein was studied by immunofluorescence staining of cells transfected with wild type and mutant constructs along with markers for different intracellular compartments. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to estimate the mRNA where as western blotting was carried out to detect protein levels of wild type and mutant 3a proteins. In vitro transcription- translation was performed to estimate cell free protein synthesis. RESULTS: While the wild type 3a protein is efficiently transported to the plasma membrane, the protein with mutations in the tyrosine and valine residues within the YXXV motif (\u0394YXX\u03A6) accumulated in the Golgi compartment. However the 3a protein with mutations within the EXD di-acidic motif (\u0394EXD) showed an intracellular distribution similar to the wild type protein. Increased retention of the \u0394YXX\u03A6 protein in the Golgi compartment also increased its association with lipid droplets. The \u0394YXX\u03A6 protein also expressed at significantly lower levels compared to the wild type 3a protein, which was reversed with Brefeldin A and Aprotinin. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the YXX\u03A6 motif of the SARS-CoV 3a protein is necessary for Golgi to plasma membrane transport, in the absence of which the protein is targeted to lysosomal degradation compartment via lipid droplets.","publish_time":"2014-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Minakshi, Rinki; Padhan, Kartika","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8eb469fc4a148699ffdf0969e3ea75048412472d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4004515.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24762043/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-11-75","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["YXXV","EXD","Brefeldin"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u0394YXX\u03A6 protein","wild type protein","protein functions","protein levels of wild type","cell free protein synthesis","acidic motif","YXXV motif","YXX\u03A6 motif","Golgi compartment","SARS-CoV","tyrosine-based sorting motif","intracellular distribution similar","mutations","SARS coronavirus","intracellular trafficking","lipid droplets","plasma membrane transport","lysosomal degradation compartment","different intracellular compartments","mutant constructs","lower levels","subcellular distribution","cell surface","Increased retention","markers","\u0394EXD","valine residues","apoptosis","immunofluorescence staining of cells","ion channel","absence","association","Semi-quantitative RT-PCR","mRNA","viral pathogenesis","data","BACKGROUND","proteins","western blotting","transcription- translation","METHODS","Brefeldin","RESULTS","role","motifs","Aprotinin","CONCLUSIONS","case"],"language":"en"},

However, a comparison of the difference in the HTS results based on the choice of reducing agent used and potency comparisons of selected inhibitors has not been done with the physiological reducing agent, reduced glutathione (GSH). Here, we compared the effects of three reducing agents: dithiothreitol (DTT), \u03B2-mercaptoethanol (\u03B2-MCE), and tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP), in addition to GSH, against three drug target proteins. Approximately 100,000 compounds were computationally screened for each target protein, and experimental testing of high scoring compounds (~560 compounds) with the four reducing agents surprisingly produced many non-overlapping hits. More importantly, we find that various reducing agents alter inhibitor potency (IC(50)) from ~10 \u00B5M with one reducing agent to complete loss (IC(50) \u003E 200 \u00B5M) of inhibitory activity with another reducing agent. Therefore, the choice of reducing agent in a HTS is critical as this may lead to the pursuit of falsely identified active compounds or failure to identify the true active compounds.

Currently, in Germany over 140,000 cases of COVID-19 are confirmed. Here we report a nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the pediatric dialysis unit of the University Hospital of M\u00FCnster (UHM). METHODS: Single-step real-time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swaps was used to diagnose the index patient and identify infected contacts. Epidemiological links were analyzed by patient interviews and chart reviews. In addition, each contact was assessed for exposure to the index case and monitored for clinical symptoms. Threshold cycle (C(t)) values of all positive test results were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. RESULTS: Forty-eight cases were involved in this nosocomial outbreak. Nine contact cases developed laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infections. Two SARS-CoV-2 positive cases remained clinically asymptomatic. Eleven cases reported flu-like symptoms without positive results. C(t) values were significantly lower in cases presenting typical COVID-19 symptoms, suggesting high viral shedding (p =0.007). CONCLUSION: Person-to-person transmission was at the heart of a hospital outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 between healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients in the pediatric dialysis unit at the UHM. Semi quantitative real-time RT-PCR results suggest that individuals with high viral load pose a risk to spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital setting. Our epidemiological observation highlights the need to develop strategies to trace and monitor SARS-CoV-2 infected HCWs in order to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in the hospital setting.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwierzeck, Vera; K\u00F6nig, Jens Christian; K\u00FChn, Joachim; Mellmann, Alexander; Correa-Mart\u00EDnez, Carlos Luis; Omran, Heymut; Konrad, Martin; Kaiser, Thomas; Kampmeier, Stefanie","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0f04e6b29837e2b1d6821e01a047cfdb715c1ea.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337584/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UHM"],"locations":["China","Germany"],"keyphrases":["cases of COVID","positive cases","contact cases","asymptomatic cases","monitor SARS-CoV","hospital outbreak of SARS","nosocomial outbreak of SARS","positive results","typical COVID","hospital setting","positive test results","quantitative real-time RT-PCR results","pediatric dialysis unit","infected HCWs","values","University Hospital of M\u00FCnster","index patient","clinical symptoms","infections","UHM","high viral load","high viral shedding","Single-step real-time RT-PCR","patient interviews","index case","Coronavirus disease","infected contacts","person transmission","epidemiological observation","Epidemiological links","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","life-threatening respiratory condition","patients","individuals","nasopharyngeal swaps","order","risk","heart","healthcare workers","METHODS","strategies","outbreaks","laboratory","flu","need","chart reviews","Threshold cycle","exposure","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","Germany","addition","China"],"language":"en"},

However, about 15 % of patients progress to severe stages and 2.5% of these patients succumb to this illness. Most patients with severe disease belong to the elderly age group (\u003C 65 years of age) and have multiple associated co-morbidities. The immune responses induced by the COVID 19 virus, during the incubation and non-severe stages, requires the early initiation of a specific adaptive immune response to eliminate the virus and prevent the progress to severe stages. In patients with a dysfunctional bridge adaptive immunity, the innate immune response becomes exaggerated due to the lack of feedback from the adaptive immune cells. The resultant cytokine storm is responsible for the severe lung injury leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in COVID 19 patients. Mesenchymal stem cells are known to suppress overactive immune responses as well as bring about tissue regeneration and repair.

Treatments of proven efficacy are currently limited predominantly to herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus. Development of new therapies has been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal model systems for some important viruses and by the difficulty in conducting human clinical trials for diseases that may be rare, or in the case of arboviral infections, often have variable seasonal and geographic incidence. Nonetheless, many novel approaches to antiviral therapy are available including candidate thiazolide and purazinecarboxamide derivatives with potential broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy. New herpesvirus drugs include viral helicase-primase and terminase inhibitors. The use of antisense oligonucleotides and other strategies to interfere with viral RNA translation has shown efficacy in experimental models of CNS viral disease. Identifying specific molecular targets within viral replication cycles has led to many existing antivirals and will undoubtedly continue to be the basis of future drug design. A promising new area of research involves therapies based on enhanced understanding of host antiviral immune responses. Toll-like receptor agonists, and drugs that inhibit specific cytokines as well as interferon preparations have all shown potential therapeutic efficacy. Passive transfer of virus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes have been used in humans and may provide an effective therapies for some herpesvirus infections and potentially for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Humanized monoclonal antibodies directed against specific viral proteins have been developed and in several cases evaluated in humans in settings including West Nile virus and HIV infection and in pre-exposure prophylaxis for rabies.","publish_time":"2013-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nath, Avindra; Tyler, Kenneth L.","journal":"Annals of Neurology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0785cc762d87d46a82c3128eb24757a0e24a3f9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0f1ea72ff3af59caa181769384e53c4a5ef48a1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4052367.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.23988; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4052367?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23913580/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific viral proteins","emerging viral CNS infections","viral helicase-primase","viral replication cycles","viral RNA translation","herpesvirus infections","potential broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy","specific cytokines","potential therapeutic efficacy","human immunodeficiency virus","New herpesvirus drugs","Development of new therapies","experimental models of CNS viral disease","antiviral therapy","specific molecular targets","effective therapies","humans","Treatments of proven efficacy","specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes","West Nile virus","Passive transfer of virus","case of arboviral infections","human clinical trials","major sources of human morbidity","promising new area of research","existing antivirals","enhanced understanding of host antiviral immune responses","purazinecarboxamide derivatives","HIV infection","candidate thiazolide","strategies","settings","lack of appropriate animal model systems","important viruses","interferon preparations","pre-exposure prophylaxis","difficulty","Humanized monoclonal antibodies","diseases","novel approaches","mortality","terminase inhibitors","herpesviruses","progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy","receptor agonists","basis of future drug design","use of antisense oligonucleotides","geographic incidence","rabies","Toll","cases"],"language":"en"},

Twelve calves were included in the study: Three animals were exposed to H. somnus only, and two to M. dispar only, whereas five were challenged to M. dispar followed by exposure to H. somnus 11\u201314 days later. Also, one calf was exposed to M. dispar followed by exposure to a sterile saline solution 11 days later, and one calf was only exposed to a sterile saline solution. Just one animal, only challenged with H. somnus, developed a focal necrotizing pneumonia, from which H. somnus was isolated. Thus, the ability of H. somnus and M. dispar to act as primary pathogens under these conditions were minimal and inconsistent.

This is part of a wider problem, relating to air quality in indoor environment, such as homes or offices, where people spend more than 90% of their time. In particular, if indoor exposure occurs quickly and without any gradual adaptation to a temperature 2\u00B0\u20133\u00B0 lower than the external temperature and especially with a 5\u00B0 difference (avoiding indoor temperature below 24\u00B0) and an humidity between 40 and 60%, there is a risk of negative consequences on the respiratory tract and the patient risks to be in a clinical condition characterized by an exacerbation of the respiratory symptoms of his chronic respiratory disease (asthma and COPD) within a few hours or days. Surprisingly, these effects of cold climate remain out of the focus of the media unless spells of unusually cold weather sweep through a local area or unstable weather conditions associated with extremely cold periods of increasing frequency and duration. Moreover, the energy consumed by air conditioning induces an increase of CO(2) in atmosphere with increase of global warming.

Bats have been recognized as one of the most important reservoirs for emerging viruses and the transmission of a coronavirus that originated in bats to humans via intermediate hosts was responsible for the high-impact emerging zoonosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)(2\u201310). Here we provide virological, epidemiological, evolutionary and experimental evidence that a novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), is the aetiological agent that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs in China that has caused the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms. Notably, the outbreak began in Guangdong province in the vicinity of the origin of the SARS pandemic. Furthermore, we identified SADS-related CoVs with 96\u201398% sequence identity in 9.8% (58 out of 591) of anal swabs collected from bats in Guangdong province during 2013\u20132016, predominantly in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) that are known reservoirs of SARS-related CoVs. We found that there were striking similarities between the SADS and SARS outbreaks in geographical, temporal, ecological and aetiological settings. This study highlights the importance of identifying coronavirus diversity and distribution in bats to mitigate future outbreaks that could threaten livestock, public health and economic growth.","publish_time":"2018-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Peng; Fan, Hang; Lan, Tian; Yang, Xing-Lou; Shi, Wei-Feng; Zhang, Wei; Zhu, Yan; Zhang, Ya-Wei; Xie, Qing-Mei; Mani, Shailendra; Zheng, Xiao-Shuang; Li, Bei; Li, Jin-Man; Guo, Hua; Pei, Guang-Qian; An, Xiao-Ping; Chen, Jun-Wei; Zhou, Ling; Mai, Kai-Jie; Wu, Zi-Xian; Li, Di; Anderson, Danielle E.; Zhang, Li-Biao; Li, Shi-Yue; Mi, Zhi-Qiang; He, Tong-Tong; Cong, Feng; Guo, Peng-Ju; Huang, Ren; Luo, Yun; Liu, Xiang-Ling; Chen, Jing; Huang, Yong; Sun, Qiang; Zhang, Xiang-Li-Lan; Wang, Yuan-Yuan; Xing, Shao-Zhen; Chen, Yan-Shan; Sun, Yuan; Li, Juan; Daszak, Peter; Wang, Lin-Fa; Shi, Zheng-Li; Tong, Yi-Gang; Ma, Jing-Yun","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df06d4e191658617b7afccc68b5258fbebb85d86.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9108c999b41c997283b3e3fea5a98d3d41f7b2de.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094983.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29618817/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0010-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["reservoirs of SARS","SARS outbreaks","horseshoe bats","SADS-related CoVs","coronavirus diversity","SARS pandemic","swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus","novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus","emerging viruses","wildlife animal reservoirs","animal health","important reservoirs","SADS-CoV","Guangdong province","severe acute respiratory syndrome","future outbreaks","Cross-species transmission of viruses","public health","aetiological agent","aetiological settings","high-impact emerging zoonosis","large-scale outbreak of fatal disease","marked threat","experimental evidence","livestock","temporal","distribution","pigs","intermediate hosts","humans","China","economic growth","importance","origin","vicinity","anal swabs","death","Rhinolophus","similarities","piglets","farms","study","sequence identity"],"language":"en"},

As this later domain shares only remote sequence relationships with the available TLR3 templates, a more complex modeling strategy was employed that combines the iterative implementation of (multi)threading/assembly/refinement (I-TASSER) structural prediction with expertise-guided posterior refinement. The final pI329L model presents a plausible fold, good structural quality, is consistent with the available experimental data, and it corroborates our hypothesis of pI329L being a TLR3 antagonist.","publish_time":"2011-01-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henriques, Elsa S; Brito, Rui M M; Soares, Hugo; Ventura, S\u00F3nia; de Oliveira, Vivian L; Parkhouse, R Michael E","journal":"Protein Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ecc36ef369e1d2b3f2d1b00e66123c9e089d98d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3048410.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21280117/; https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.554; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3048410?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TLR3 antagonist","TLR3 decoy","hypothesis of pI329L","available TLR3 templates","final pI329L model","structural fold","structural prediction","virus survival","good structural quality","plausible fold","African swine fever virus","comparative modeling","novel ASFV viral protein","particular proteins","number of proteins","transmembrane protein","posterior refinement","receptor homodimer","cytoplasmic domain","Toll-interleukin","large double-stranded DNA virus responsible","later domain shares","complex modeling strategy","available experimental data","structure prediction protocols","remote sequence relationships","extracellular putative leucine-rich repeats similar","lethal pig disease","multi","threading","transmission","hosts","TASSER","expertise","atomistic level","pathways","assembly","iterative implementation","host\u0027s innate immune response","danger detector","infected macrophages","vaccine","genome","idea"],"language":"en"},

In vaccine probe studies, efficacy is dependent on the specificity of the study outcome to detect pneumonia and the impact of the vaccine on the selected outcome, and may underestimate the true burden of bacterial pneumonia. The rising incidence of antibiotic resistance, emerging respiratory pathogens, potential replacement pneumococcal disease following widespread introduction of pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine, the limited specificity of chest radiography, and the poor sensitivity of blood culture are substantial obstacles to accurate surveillance. We provide an overview of the diagnostic challenges of bacterial pneumonia and highlight the need for refining the current diagnostic approach to ensure adequate epidemiological surveillance of childhood pneumonia and the success, or otherwise, of any immunisation strategies.","publish_time":"2006-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Obaro, Stephen K; Madhi, Shabir A","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aaa9c4d0448ad52a4b6bd3eb5374414ce23e68f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106399.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S147330990670411X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147330990670411X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Summary Bacterial pneumonia","bacterial causes of pneumonia","diagnostic challenges of bacterial pneumonia","true burden of bacterial pneumonia","adequate epidemiological surveillance of childhood pneumonia","poor sensitivity of blood culture","vaccine probe studies","substantial obstacles","low sensitivity","substantial cause of childhood morbidity","accurate surveillance","specific burden","study outcome","widespread introduction of pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine","selected outcome","current diagnostic approach","potential replacement pneumococcal disease","limited specificity of chest radiography","emerging respiratory pathogens","mortality","rising incidence of antibiotic resistance","guidelines","determination of pathogen","efficacy","need","radiological findings","initiating care","impact","overview","success","developed settings","immunisation strategies"],"language":"en"},

The most consistent association is with viral infections but, as it is still debated whether any micro-organisms are involved in its pathogenesis, we critically appraised the literature concerning HPS and its relationship with infections. DISCUSSION: Infection-dependent HPS has been widely observed, but there are no data concerning its incidence in children. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HPS may clarify the interactions between the immune system and the variously implicated potential infectious agents. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been prominently associated with HPS, with clonal proliferation and the hyperactivation of EBV-infected T cells. However, a number of other viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections have been reported in association with HPS. In the case of low-risk HPS, corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin or cyclosporine A may be sufficient to control the biological process, but etoposide is recommended as a means of reversing infection-dependent lymphohistiocytic dysregulation in high-risk cases. SUMMARY: HPS is a potential complication of various infections. A polymerase chain reaction search for infectious agents including EBV, cytomegalovirus and Leishmania is recommended in clinical settings characterised by non-remitting fever, organomegaly, cytopenia and hyperferritinemia.","publish_time":"2013-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ansuini, Valentina; Rigante, Donato; Esposito, Susanna","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71d134916c750fb6f875d3936a957b27a5df72bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3549728.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23324497/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathophysiology of HPS","risk HPS","Infection-dependent HPS","viral infections","parasitic infections","hyperactivation of EBV","immune system","implicated potential infectious agents","potential complication of various infections","reticuloendothelial system","means of reversing infection-dependent lymphohistiocytic dysregulation","combination of fever","clonal proliferation","consistent association","progressive macrophage proliferation","non-remitting fever","coagulation abnormalities","pancytopenia","liver dysfunction","clinical settings","polymerase chain reaction search","corticosteroids","Leishmania","cytomegalovirus","cytokine over-production","high-risk cases","intravenous immunoglobulin","infected T cells","interactions","Epstein-Barr virus","case of low","biological process","etoposide","cyclosporine","literature","BACKGROUND","Hemophagocytic syndrome","better understanding","SUMMARY","relationship","DISCUSSION","data","incidence","children","pathogenesis","tumoral diseases","number","hyperferritinemia","micro-organisms"],"language":"en"},

Both infections have crossed the species barrier to infect humans. SARS originated from southern China and spread to many countries in early 2003. The close collaboration of scientists around the world resulted in a rapid identification of the causative agent, and the early isolation of infected cases and meticulous infection control measures were the key to successfully controlling the outbreak of SARS. The first outbreak of human cases of avian influenza was reported in 1997 in Hong Kong. Since 2003, there have been many small outbreaks of human cases around the world, and the reported mortality is greater than 50%. Current evidence suggests that the human-to-human transmission of avian influenza is rather inefficient, but mutation might occur in the future resulting in improved transmission and possibly a pandemic in humans. As with the outbreak of SARS, the development of sensitive and accurate early diagnostic tests is extremely important for successful control of the outbreak at source. The availability of isolation facilities, the stockpiling of antiviral agents and effective and safe vaccination will be extremely important in minimising the damage of a new influenza pandemic.","publish_time":"2007-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Gary W.K.; Leung, Ting F.","journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ef94ae498d245b39001dc42f581beafd1a29293.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106181.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054207000334; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054207000334","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["outbreak of SARS","outbreak of human cases of avian influenza","human transmission of avian influenza","new influenza pandemic","early isolation of infected cases","small outbreaks of human cases","world","pandemic potential","humans","successful control","accurate early diagnostic tests","emerged infections","improved transmission","reported mortality","availability of isolation facilities","meticulous infection control measures","stockpiling of antiviral agents","development of sensitive","Summary Severe acute respiratory syndrome","safe vaccination","causative agent","key","rapid identification","damage","close collaboration of scientists","future","southern China","mutation","species barrier","source","countries","Current evidence","Hong Kong"],"language":"en"},

Monitoring those changes is necessary for vaccine selection. In addition, H3N2 viruses were considered to be seeded from Southeast Asia before spreading globally. This study described the molecular epidemiology of influenza A during the post\u2010pandemic season 2010\u20132011 in Vietnam. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from children with respiratory infections at Children\u0027s Hospital 2, Ho Chi Minh City. The HA, NA, M genes were amplified, sequenced and analyzed. Thirty\u2010five of 1,082 (3.2%) patients were positive for influenza A, including 14 pandemic H1N1 2009 (H1N1pdm09) and 21 H3N2 infections. H3N2 was dominant in the rainy season (May\u2013October 2010) while H1N1pdm09 was dominant in the dry season (November 2010\u2013April 2011). Phylogenetic analysis showed that Vietnamese H1N1pdm09 sequences in 2010\u20132011 formed the distinct cluster, with other contemporary Asian and 2012\u2010American sequences, suggesting a possible common ancestor. All were oseltamivir\u2010sensitive except two strains carrying S247N and D199N in NA which reduced the neuraminidase inhibitor susceptibility. The Vietnamese H3N2 viruses in mid\u20102010 belonged to the emerging subclade Perth10/2010, which then spread worldwide in 2011. The Vietnamese influenza viruses were well matched with the Southern Hemisphere vaccine formulation. Mutations at antigenic sites were also identified in these viruses.

Objectives We assessed the proportion of RVs and their impact on the outcome of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the intensive care unit (ICU). Study design Cases of HAP were retrospectively selected among patients who underwent screening for RVs by multiplex PCR (mPCR) in the ICU of a French tertiary care hospital from May 2014 to April 2016. ICU length of stay and in-hospital mortality were compared between four groups defined according to the identified pathogens: virus only (V), virus/bacteria (V/B), bacteria only (B) and no pathogen (Neg). When available, previous mPCR was retrieved in order to assess possible chronic viral carriage. Results Overall, 95/999 (10%) ICU patients who underwent mPCR had HAP (V(17,18%), V/B(13,14%), B(60,63%), Neg(5,5%)). Median age was 61 years and 45 (47%) were immunocompromised. Influenza (27%) and rhinovirus (27%) were the most common RVs. V/B group had higher mortality rate than B and V groups (62% vs. 40% and 35%, p=0.3) and a significantly longer length of stay (31days (18\u201348)) than V group (5days (3\u201311), p=0.0002)) and B group (14.5days (5.5\u201325.5), p=0.007)). Among the 15 patients with available mPCR tests before viral HAP, seven were negative and eight were positive corresponding to long-term carriage of community-acquired viruses. Discussion RVs were detected in 32% of HAP patients who underwent mPCR. Two situations were encountered: (i) acute acquired viral infection; (ii) long-term viral carriage (mostly rhinovirus) especially in immunocompromised patients complicated by a virus/bacteria coinfection. The latter was associated with a longer length of stay and a trend toward a higher mortality.","publish_time":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loubet, Paul; Voiriot, Guillaume; Houhou-Fidouh, Nadhira; Neuville, Mathilde; Bouadma, Lila; Lescure, Francois-Xavier; Descamps, Diane; Timsit, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Visseaux, Benoit","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c3e7b14bd0f61e4ca92cccbdc64a581e9f17c27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106511.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653217301129; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2017.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653217301129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28494435/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","HAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HAP patients","viral HAP","B group","V groups","ICU patients","hospital mortality","ICU length","immunocompromised patients","long-term viral carriage","previous mPCR","proportion of RVs","common RVs","Discussion RVs","days","available mPCR tests","longer length of stay","viral infection","outcome of hospital","possible chronic viral carriage","Study design Cases of HAP","long-term carriage of community","higher mortality rate","French tertiary care hospital","pneumonia","rhinovirus","bacteria coinfection","Neg","role of respiratory viruses","intensive care unit","frequency","order","positive corresponding","multiplex PCR","impact","screening","trend","identified pathogens","Abstract Background Data","Median age","years","Objectives","Influenza","situations","Results"],"language":"en"},

CCoV-I strain 23/03 has a genome of 30,000 nucleotides, excluding the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail, displaying the typical Alphacoronavirus-1 organization and the highest genetic relatedness to CCoV-II. However, two distinct features were observed in the CCoV-I genome: (i) the presence of an additional ORF between the spike (S) protein gene and ORF3a; (ii) the diversity of the S protein, which is more closely related to that of feline coronavirus type I and presents a furin cleavage site.

Recent studies point out to a cell entry mechanism of this virus similar to other enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1. As it happens with other viruses peptidic fusion inhibitors, SARS-CoV S protein HR2-derived peptides are potential therapeutic drugs against the virus. It is believed that HR2 peptides block the six-helix bundle formation, a key structure in the viral fusion, by interacting with the HR1 region. It is a matter of discussion if the HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide T20 (enfuvirtide) could be a possible SARS-CoV inhibitor given the similarities between the two viruses. We tested the possibility of interaction between both T20 (HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide) and T-1249 with S protein HR1- and HR2-derived peptides. Our biophysical data show a significant interaction between a SARS-CoV HR1-derived peptide and T20. However, the interaction is only moderate (K B =(1.1\u00B10.3)\u00D7105 M\u22121).

A wide variety of emerging and re-emerging viruses contribute to this disease burden. New emerging infections are commonly due to RNA viruses that have expanded their geographic range, spread from animal reservoirs or acquired new neurovirulence properties. Mosquito-borne viruses with expanding ranges include West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and Chikungunya virus. Zoonotic viruses that have recently crossed into humans to cause neurologic disease include the bat henipaviruses Nipah and Hendra, as well as the primate-derived human immunodeficiency virus. Viruses adapt to new hosts, or to cause more severe disease, by changing their genomes through reassortment (e.g. influenza virus), mutation (essentially all RNA viruses) and recombination (e.g. vaccine strains of poliovirus). Viruses that appear to have recently become more neurovirulent include West Nile virus, enterovirus 71 and possibly Chikungunya virus. In addition to these newer challenges, rabies, polio and measles all remain important causes of neurologic disease despite good vaccines and global efforts toward control. Control of human rabies depends on elimination of rabies in domestic dogs through regular vaccination. Poliovirus eradication is challenged by the ability of the live attenuated vaccine strains to revert to virulence during the prolonged period of gastrointestinal replication. Measles elimination depends on delivery of two doses of live virus vaccine to a high enough proportion of the population to maintain herd immunity for this highly infectious virus.","publish_time":"2010-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Griffin, Diane E.","journal":"Progress in Neurobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d13b60a627224c33acc73076445c1bacc06b03c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a171ceb000ab49f2cb767d6e02429ad9f2372848.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2860042.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pneurobio.2009.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20004230/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008209001889; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2860042?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301008209001889","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Chikungunya virus","influenza virus","infectious virus","RNA viruses","West Nile virus","re-emerging viruses","Zoonotic viruses","doses of live virus vaccine","Japanese encephalitis virus","severe disease","disease burden","primate-derived human immunodeficiency virus","important causes of neurologic disease","elimination of rabies","Control of human rabies","vaccine strains of poliovirus","New emerging infections","live attenuated vaccine strains","Measles elimination","new hosts","major cause of disability","new neurovirulence properties","Poliovirus eradication","wide variety of emerging","good vaccines","expanding ranges","animal reservoirs","resource-poor countries","enterovirus","global efforts","domestic dogs","bat henipaviruses Nipah","proportion","genomes","delivery","recombination","newer challenges","substantial portion","herd immunity","geographic range","population","Hendra","regular vaccination","neurovirulent","prolonged period of gastrointestinal replication","mutation","addition","Mosquito","reassortment","humans","CNS"],"language":"en"},

The relative IBV shedding titers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs on days 3 and 5 after intraocular infection. The viral load was significantly decreased in the 3D8 scFv transgenic chickens from the contact transmission group. Additionally, blood was collected from each group on day 17 post-infection.

The recent progress in disciplines such as genomics, proteomics and structural biology have improved our fundamental understanding of the viral world. These advances can be used to efficiently create new drugs more selective and more effective.

In the current study, two recombinant baculovirus were generated to express the spike (S) protein of SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) isolated from bats (vAcBS) and the envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins of SARS-CoV, respectively. Co-infection of insect cells with these two recombinant baculoviruses led to self-assembly of virus-like particles (BVLPs) as demonstrated by electron microscopy. Incorporation of S protein of vAcBS (BS) into VLPs was confirmed by western blot and immunogold labeling. Such BVLPs up-regulated the level of CD40, CD80, CD86, CD83, and enhanced the secretion of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03B1 in immature dendritic cells (DCs). Immune responses were compared in immature DCs inoculated with BVLPs or with VLPs formed by S, E and M proteins of human SARS-CoV. BVLPs showed a stronger ability to stimulate DCs in terms of cytokine induction as evidenced by 2 to 6 fold higher production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03B1. Further study indicated that IFN-\u03B3\u002B and IL-4\u002B populations in CD4\u002B T cells increased upon co-cultivation with DCs pre-exposed with BVLPs or SARS-CoV VLPs. The observed difference in DC-stimulating activity between BVLPs and SARS CoV VLPs was very likely due to the S protein. In agreement, SL-CoV S DNA vaccine evoked a more vigorous antibody response and a stronger T cell response than SARS-CoV S DNA in mice. Our data have demonstrated for the first time that SL-CoV VLPs formed by membrane proteins of different origins, one from SL-CoV isolated from bats (BS) and the other two from human SARS-CoV (E and M), activated immature DCs and enhanced the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and the secretion of cytokines. Finding in this study may provide important information for vaccine development as well as for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-like CoV.","publish_time":"2008-07-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bai, Bingke; Hu, Qinxue; Hu, Hui; Zhou, Peng; Shi, Zhengli; Meng, Jin; Lu, Baojing; Huang, Yi; Mao, Panyong; Wang, Hanzhong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/505d4036449010b44702841ae2564d6a55a3fbcd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2441860.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18628832/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002685","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","SARS CoV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV VLPs","SARS CoV VLPs","SARS-CoV S DNA","SL-CoV VLPs","proteins of human SARS-CoV","proteins of SARS","protein of SARS","BVLPs","SL-CoV S DNA vaccine","pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus","immature DCs","Incorporation of S protein of vAcBS","secretion of IL","DCs pre-exposed","immature dendritic cells","co-cultivation","Co-infection of insect cells","TNF-\u03B1","bats","current study","stronger T cell response","membrane proteins of different origins","fold higher production of IL","expression of co-stimulatory molecules","stronger ability","vaccine development","recombinant baculoviruses","secretion of cytokines","vigorous antibody response","activity","self-assembly of virus","CD80","CD86","CD83","level of CD40","important information","populations","envelope","spike","time","agreement","mice","terms of cytokine induction","observed difference","western blot","particles","IFN-\u03B3","Immune responses","immunogold","electron microscopy","data"],"language":"en"},

A phylogenetic analysis revealed that PmDAP IV is a closer relative of dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 (DPP8 and DPP9, DPP IV-family enzymes) than DPP IV.

Our multivariate CAR model allows each outcome to have a different neighborhood structure which can utilize different lattices for each structure. The model is applied in two real data analysis.

The second is a multivariate analysis of poverty levels and educational attainment in the American Community Survey.","publish_time":"2014-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Porter, Aaron T.; Oleson, Jacob J.","journal":"Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e160a0e9789ea3d32f5bd067514b91c66890fec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6d9dd2e1654d7ba8ba52a3dae30d16e44f16830f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185497.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2014.08.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877584514000604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25457598/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877584514000604","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multivariate outcome","different lattices","different neighborhood structure","multivariate analysis of poverty levels","current multivariate CAR models","multivariate Gaussian conditional autoregressive model","mismatched lattices","change of basis","lattice structure","mapping infectious diseases","real data analysis","educational attainment","use","multiple channels of infection flow","importance","American Community Survey","Iowa Mumps epidemic","Bayesian learning example","applications","case","paper"],"language":"en"},

However, the real role of virus was still controversial. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with CAP between April and December, 2009 were prospectively enrolled. A four-fold or greater increase of IgG-titres against respiratory viruses in pair sera was tested by means of hemagglutination inhibition assay or indirect immunofluorescence. Swab samples were tested by cell culture and/or nucleic amplification tests. Viral etiology was considered definitive if at least one of the above tests was positive. RESULTS: Viral etiology was established in fifty-two (34.9%) of 149 CAP patients, twenty-two (81.5%) of 27 influenza like illness patients, and none of 75 volunteer controls. Forty-seven CAP patients were infected by a single virus (24 influenza A virus, 5 influenza B, 10 parainfluenza virus type 3 [PIV-3], 2 PIV-1, 2 adenovirus, 2 human rhinovirus and 2 coronavirus OC43), five cases by two or three viruses co-infection. Fever \u2265 39\u00B0C (66.7%), fatigue (64.6%), and purulent sputum (52.1%) was the most common symptoms in viral pneumonia patients. On multivariate analysis, myalgia was included in the model for pneumonia associated with influenza infection. In the CURB-65 model only influenza infection was found independently associated with severe disease (CURB-65 score \u2265 3) out of variables, including age(years), sex, current smoking status, sick contact with febrile patients, numbers of comorbidity, presence of influenza infection, presence of PIV infection, with P = 0.021, OR 7.86 (95% CI 1.37-45.04). CONCLUSION: Respiratory virus was not a bystander, but pathogenic in pneumonia and was a common cause of CAP.","publish_time":"2014-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhan, Yangqing; Yang, Zifeng; Chen, Rongchang; Wang, Yutao; Guan, Wenda; Zhao, Suishan","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2934008a223a07e3fd3c886db120eb1fe3aab567.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4236731.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25178477/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2466-14-144","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CAP patients","viral pneumonia patients","presence of influenza infection","febrile patients","illness patients","influenza B","presence of PIV infection","single virus","Consecutive adult patients","Viral etiology","viruses co-infection","Viral pathogens","parainfluenza virus type","real role of virus","respiratory viruses","model","CURB","common symptoms","common cause of","nucleic amplification tests","sick contact","titres","current smoking status","numbers of comorbidity","sex","cell culture","years","greater increase of IgG","human rhinovirus","pair sera","hemagglutination inhibition assay","indirect immunofluorescence","coronavirus OC43","score","cases","METHODS","bystander","severe disease","variables","age","Swab samples","fold","myalgia","adenovirus","multivariate analysis","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","community","volunteer controls","purulent sputum","Fever","fatigue","CI"],"language":"en"},

In these cases, lncRNAs have been shown to be key regulators of several cellular processes. Therefore, there is a great need to understand the function of more lncRNAs and their regulation in response to stimuli. Interferon (IFN) is a key molecule in the cellular antiviral response. IFN binding to its receptor activates transcription of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that function as potent antivirals. In addition, several ISGs are positive or negative regulators of the IFN pathway. This is essential to ensure a strong antiviral response and a later return of the cell to homeostasis. As the ISGs described to date are coding genes, we sought to determine whether IFN also regulates the expression of long non-coding ISGs. To this aim, we used RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of control and HuH7 cells treated with IFN\u03B12. The results show that IFN-treatment regulates the expression of several unknown non-coding transcripts. We have validated two lncRNAs upregulated after treatment with different doses of type I IFN\u03B12 in different cells or with type III IFN\u03BB. These lncRNAs were also induced by influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus mutants unable to block the IFN response, but not by several wild-type lytic viruses tested. These lncRNA genes were named lncISG15 and lncBST2 as they are located close to ISGs ISG15 and BST2, respectively. Interestingly, inhibition experiments showed that lncBST2 is a positive regulator of BST2. Therefore lncBST2 has been renamed BISPR, from BST2 IFN-stimulated positive regulator. Our results may have therapeutic implications as lncBST2/BISPR, but also lncISG15 and their coding neighbors, are increased in cells infected with hepatitis C virus and in the liver of infected patients. These results allow us to hypothesize that several lncRNAs could be activated by IFN to control the potency of the antiviral IFN response.","publish_time":"2015-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barriocanal, Marina; Carnero, Elena; Segura, Victor; Fortes, Puri","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a698e56af8042a4c35a26127c4da5fc5ff7fa95.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4288319.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25620967/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00655","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral IFN response","IFN-treatment","lncRNAs","IFN binding","IFN pathway","IFN-stimulated genes","BST2 IFN-stimulated positive regulator","coding genes","lncBST2","expression of long non-coding ISGs","cellular antiviral response","different cells","strong antiviral response","ISGs ISG15","coding neighbors","results","long non-coding RNAs","positive regulator of BST2","unknown non-coding transcripts","HuH7 cells","different doses of type","function","IFN\u03B12","key regulators","BISPR","lncISG15","lncRNA genes","key molecule","negative regulators","wild-type lytic viruses","transcriptome of control","cellular processes","hepatitis C virus","liver of infected patients","vesicular stomatitis virus mutants unable","influenza","later return","transcription","therapeutic implications","regulation","receptor","potency","RNA sequencing","homeostasis","potent antivirals","IFN\u03BB","date","inhibition experiments","aim","great need","stimuli","addition","Interferon","cases"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we tried to produce and purify the recombinant Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (rBmNPV-hPRR) that displayed human (pro)renin receptor (hPRR) connected with FLAG peptide sequence on its own surface. These particles were used for further binding analysis of hPRR to human prorenin. The rBmNPV-hPRR was produced in silkworm larvae and purified from its hemolymph using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). RESULTS: A rapid method of BmNPV titer determination in hemolymph was performed using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR). A correlation coefficient of BmNPV determination between end-point dilution and Q-PCR methods was found to be 0.99. rBmNPV-hPRR bacmid-injected silkworm larvae produced recombinant baculovirus of 1.31 \u00D7 10(8 )plaque forming unit (pfu) in hemolymph, which was 2.8 \u00D7 10(4 )times higher than transfection solution in Bm5 cells. Its purification yield by Sephacryl S-1000 SF column chromatography was 264 fold from larval hemolymph at 4 days post-injection (p.i.), but 35 or 39 fold at 4.5 or 5 days p.i., respectively. Protein patterns of rBmNPV-hPRR purified at 4 and 5 days were the same and ratio of envelope proteins (76, 45 and 35 kDa) to VP39, one of nucleocapsid proteins, increased at 5 days p.i. hPRR was detected in only purified rBmNPV-hPRR at 5 days p.i.. CONCLUSION: The successful purification of rBmNPV-hPRR indicates that baculovirus production using silkworm larvae and its purification from hemolymph by Sephacryl S-1000 SF column chromatography can provide an economical approach in obtaining the purified BmNPV stocks with high titer for large-scale production of hPRR. Also, it can be utilized for further binding analysis and screening of inhibitors of hPRR.","publish_time":"2009-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kato, Tatsuya; Manoha, Suganthi Lavender; Tanaka, Shigeyasu; Park, Enoch Y","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb49cb90e8f1868b1d73beef301de0ebc481f183.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2703641.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19523201/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6750-9-55","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["purified rBmNPV-hPRR","binding analysis of hPRR","large-scale production of hPRR","rBmNPV-hPRR bacmid-injected silkworm larvae","successful purification of rBmNPV","larval hemolymph","purified BmNPV stocks","Protein patterns of rBmNPV","baculovirus production","SF column chromatography","days post-injection","Sephacryl S","production of antibody","recombinant baculovirus","purification yield","functional analysis of transmembrane proteins","Q-PCR methods","fold","nucleocapsid proteins","rapid method of BmNPV titer determination","correlation coefficient of BmNPV determination","size exclusion chromatography","quantitative real-time PCR","ratio of envelope proteins","high titer","human prorenin","recombinant Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus","end","dilution","economical approach","transfection solution","times higher","Bm5 cells","renin receptor","FLAG peptide sequence","vaccine","SEC","screening of inhibitors","Budded baculoviruses","surface","kDa","VP39","RESULTS","pfu","unit","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","plaque","particles","study"],"language":"en"},

Since both infections are endemic in North America, it was assumed as a working hypothesis that their geographic distributions were similar. Hence, the purpose of this exploratory analysis was to investigate the comparative geographical distribution of both viral infections. Counts of FIV (n=17,108) and FeLV (n=30,017) positive serology results (FIV antibody and FeLV ELISA) were obtained for 48 contiguous states and District of Columbia of the United States of America (US) from the IDEXX Laboratories website. The proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV infection was estimated for each administrative region and its geographic distribution pattern was visualized by a choropleth map. Statistical evidence of an excess in the proportional morbidity ratio from unity was assessed using the spatial scan test under the normal probability model. RESULTS: This study revealed distinct spatial distribution patterns in the proportional morbidity ratio suggesting the presence of one or more relevant and geographically varying risk factors. The disease map indicates that there is a higher prevalence of FIV infections in the southern and eastern US compared to FeLV. In contrast, FeLV infections were observed to be more frequent in the western US compared to FIV. The respective excess in proportional morbidity ratio was significant with respect to the spatial scan test (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The observed variability in the geographical distribution of the proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV may be related to the presence of an additional or unique, but yet unknown, spatial risk factor.

This disease occurrs the first day after hatching and lasts more than 30 days, resulting in approximately 70% morbidity and 30% mortality in broilers. The objective of this study was to isolate and identify the pathogens that are responsible for the progressive pneumonia and establish an animal model for drug screening. RESULTS: 193 serum samples were collected from 8 intensive farms from 5 provinces in China and analysed in the current research. Our clinical survey showed that 65.2% to 100% of breeding broilers, breeding layers, broilers and laying hens were seropositive for ORT antibodies. From 8 intensive farms, six ORT isolates were identified by PCR and biochemical assays, and two H9N2 viruses were isolated. Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and Infectious BronchitisVirus (IBV) were excluded. Typical pneumonia and airsacculitis were observed both in broilers inoculated intraperitoneally with an ORT isolate alone and in those co-infected with ORT and H9N2 virus isolates. Specifically, the survival rate was 30%, 20%, 70%, 50% and 90% in birds inoculated with ORT\u002BH9N2 virus, ORT followed by H9N2 virus, H9N2 virus followed by ORT, and ORT or H9N2 virus alone, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that ORT infections of domestic poultry have been occurring frequently in China. ORT infection can induce higher economic losses and mortality if H9N2 AIV is also present. Although the isolation of ORT and H9N2 virus has been reported previously, there have been no reported co-infections of poultry with these two pathogens. This is the first report of co-infection of broilers with ORT and H9N2 virus, and this co-infection is probably associated with the outbreak of broiler airsacculitis in China, which has caused extensive economic losses.","publish_time":"2012-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Qing; Liu, Aijing; Zhang, Faming; Ling, Yong; Ou, Changbo; Hou, Na; He, Cheng","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22d812dbf1b71eb834f1244bdd26db698fed6a34.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3424113.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22748160/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORT","Newcastle Disease Virus"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["ORT isolates","ORT antibodies","isolation of ORT","H9N2 virus isolates","H9N2 AIV","H9N2 viruses","ORT infections of domestic poultry","breeding broilers","Newcastle Disease Virus","report of co-infection of broilers","China","progressive pneumonia","reported co-infections of poultry","mortality","hens","intensive farms","study","Typical pneumonia","RESULTS","pathogens","higher economic losses","extensive economic losses","breeding layers","disease occurrs","outbreak of broiler airsacculitis","NDV","animal model","Infectious BronchitisVirus","biochemical assays","PCR","serum samples","drug screening","IBV","provinces","birds","current research","CONCLUSIONS","morbidity","clinical survey","survival rate","objective","BACKGROUND","days"],"language":"en"},

A. albopictus might continue migrating north with continuing climate change and CHIKV would then no longer be confined to the developing nations. No treatment or licensed CHIKV vaccine exists. A CHIKV neutralization assay in a 384-well format by using CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors was established. This assay system can be used for entry inhibitor screening under a reduced safety level (S2). Production of CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and the reaction volume are optimized. A dose dependent, specific neutralization of CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors with sera of CHIKV-infected individuals could be measured in a 384-well format.

The objective of this study was to determine if the addition of commercial feed additives (e.i., acids, salt and sugar) to swine feed can be an effective strategy to inactive PDCoV. RESULTS: Six commercial feed acids (UltraAcid P, Activate DA, KEMGEST, Acid Booster, Luprosil, and Amasil), salt, and sugar were evaluated. The acids were added at the recommended concentrations to 5 g aliquots of complete feed, which were also inoculated with 1 mL of PDCoV and incubated for 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. In another experiment, double the recommended concentrations of these additives were also added to the feed samples and incubated for 0, 1, 3, 7, and 10 days. All samples were stored at room temperature (~25 \u00B0C) followed by removal of aliquots at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. Any surviving virus was eluted in a buffer solution and then titrated in swine testicular cells. Feed samples without any additive were used as controls. Both Weibull and log-linear kinetic models were used to analyze virus survival curves. The presence of a tail in the virus inactivation curves indicated deviations from the linear behavior and hence, the Weibull model was chosen for characterizing the inactivation responses due to the better fit. At recommended concentrations, delta values (days to decrease virus concentration by 1 log) ranged from 0.62\u20131.72 days, but there were no differences on virus survival among feed samples with or without additives at the manufacturers recommended concentrations. Doubling the concentration of the additives reduced the delta value to \u2264 0.28 days (P \u003C 0.05) for all the additives except for Amasil (delta values of 0.86 vs. 4.95 days). Feed additives that contained phosphoric acid, citric acid, or fumaric acid were the most effective in reducing virus survival, although none of the additives completely inactivated the virus by 10- days post-inoculation. CONCLUSIONS: Commercial feed additives (acidifiers and salt) may be utilized as a strategy to decrease risk of PDCoV in feed, specially, commercial feed acidifiers at double the recommended concentrations reduced PDCoV survival in complete feed during storage at room temperature. However, none of these additives completely inactivated the virus.","publish_time":"2017-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cottingim, Katie M.; Verma, Harsha; Urriola, Pedro E.; Sampedro, Fernando; Shurson, Gerald C.; Goyal, Sagar M.","journal":"Porcine Health Manag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5646a0eb649cd7e862225225aae1382f8de86f7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5382497.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40813-016-0048-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28405461/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Weibull"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["feed samples","swine feed","addition of commercial feed additives","commercial feed acids","commercial feed acidifiers","recommended concentrations","virus concentration","virus survival curves","g aliquots of complete feed","PDCoV survival","surviving virus","virus inactivation curves","days post-inoculation","delta values","salt","inactive PDCoV","risk of PDCoV","citric acid","Acid Booster","fumaric acid","phosphoric acid","porcine delta coronavirus","Amasil","effective strategy","room temperature","double","sugar","linear behavior","UltraAcid P","log-linear kinetic models","inactivation responses","Weibull model","removal of aliquots","swine testicular cells","KEMGEST","storage","potential route of transmission","Luprosil","deviations","differences","feces","buffer solution","tail","CONCLUSIONS","infected pigs","better fit","RESULTS","study","presence","BACKGROUND","experiment","manufacturers","objective","controls"],"language":"en"},

Previously, immunological studies in MS had almost exclusively used the more abundant 18.5 kDa isoform of MBP, which does not does not contain the exon 2 peptide. Investigations of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) have also focussed on the 18.5 kDa MBP isoform and its peptides. Since EAE is an animal model widely used widly used to study MS, we examined the encephalitogenic potential of exon 2 peptide in the SJL/J mouse. Evidence for increased expression of exon 2-containing isoforms during remyelination in mouse CNS suggested that exon 2-sensitized T cels, with encephalitogenic capacity, might be important in the pertuation of relapsing EAE (rEAE). Our experiments have demonstrated that exon 2 peptide is inherently immunogenic in SJL mice and that EAE could be induced by the adoptive transfer of exon 2-sensitized lymphocytes. Furthermore, the disease could be accentuated by the transfer of short-term exon 2-reactive lines or by a combination of adoptive transfer and antigenic challenge with exon 2 peptide. The immunodominant epitope(s) appeared to localize to the segment bordered by amino acids 59\u201385.","publish_time":"1994-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Segal, Benjamin M.; Raine, Cedric S.; McFarlin, Dale E.; Voskuhl, Rhonda R.; McFarland, Henry F.","journal":"Journal of Neuroimmunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee2ffc76ba19f6d79314d5f8b48c918cd13a82df.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0165572894901236; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165572894901236","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBP","EAE","SJL/J","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adoptive transfer of exon","transfer of short-term exon","encephalitogenic potential of exon","increased expression of exon","MBP isoforms","kDa isoform of MBP","kDa MBP isoform","combination of adoptive transfer","sensitized lymphocytes","pertuation of relapsing EAE","discovery of T lymphocytes reactive","sensitized T cels","reactive lines","encephalitogenic capacity","mouse CNS","SJL mice","J mouse","gene","patients","antigenic challenge","multiple sclerosis","myelin basic protein","attention","remyelination","Investigations of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis","candidate autoantigens","rEAE","Evidence","peptides","immunodominant epitope","segment","amino acids","immunological studies","animal model","experiments","disease"],"language":"en"},

The prodrug is metabolized to its active triphosphate form and interferes with the action of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-COV-2. Herein, we report the antiviral activity of remdesivir against human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) compared to known anti-HIV agents. These agents included tenofovir (TFV), 4\u0027-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2\u0027-deoxyadenosine (EFdA), alovudine (FLT), lamivudine (3TC), and emtricitabine (FTC), known as nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and a number of 5\u0027-O-fatty acylated anti-HIV nucleoside conjugates. The anti-HIV nucleosides interfere with HIV RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and/or act as chain terminators. Normal human fibroblast lung cells (MRC-5) were used to determine the cytotoxicity of the compounds. The study revealed that remdesivir exhibited an EC50 value of 0.07 \u00B5M against HCoV-229E with TC50 of \u003E 2.00 \u00B5M against MRC-5 cells. Parent NRTIs were found to be inactive against (HCoV-229E) at tested concentrations. Among all the NRTIs and 5\u0027-O-fatty acyl conjugates of NRTIs, 5\u0027-O-tetradecanoyl ester conjugate of FTC showed modest activity with EC50 and TC50 values of 72.8 \u00B5M and 87.5 \u00B5M, respectively.

Altogether 40554 cases have been confirmed globally with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) until February 10, 2020. Rigorous surveillance in other countries is required to prevent further global expansion of the outbreak, but resolving the exact mechanism of the initial transmission events is crucial. Most initial cases had visited Huanan South Seafood Market in Wuhan selling also various exotic live animals. Based on the limited initial human-to-human transmission and timely clustering of cases in Huanan market among elderly men, coupled with knowledge that coronaviruses are derived from animals and relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to bat coronavirus, zoonotic transmission in the first instance is probable. To target the actions, similar epidemiological actions to human cases are needed with animal or food exposures. According to current information, an exceptionally wide contamination of seafood market might explain the initiation of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Seafood tanks, air contamination by live animals or rodents are possibilities, but sold animals normally come from various sources. The mode of transmission may become clearer in future: usually in outbreak investigations, hindsight is easy, but for now information about the initial source of this outbreak is limited.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jalava, Katri","journal":"International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fdcd6d28e5d3836ebf047b6d2915611000d5615c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129563.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113490; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463920300997; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32088598/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463920300997","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Huanan South Seafood Market"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["initial cases","human cases","human transmission","initial transmission events","limited initial human","remarkable coronavirus outbreak","outbreak investigations","SARS-CoV","Huanan market","zoonotic transmission","mode of transmission","initial source","Huanan South Seafood Market","wide contamination of seafood market","various exotic live animals","Wuhan","timely clustering of cases","Seafood tanks","bat coronavirus","novel coronavirus","relationship of SARS","air contamination","various sources","current information","similar epidemiological actions","rodents","elderly men","epicentre","exact mechanism","coronaviruses","knowledge","future","possibilities","initiation","countries","instance","hindsight","China","food exposures","global expansion","Rigorous surveillance","world"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, iron deficiency is linked to pica, which may increase uptake of Eimeria oocysts. Coccidiosis in sheep, caused by Eimeria spp., is an important infection, leading to reduced welfare and economic losses. The aims of our study were to investigate: (1) the use of iron supplementation in Norwegian sheep flocks using a questionnaire survey, and (2) whether iron supplementation reduced excretion of Eimeria oocysts and increased the growth rates of young lambs. RESULTS: A questionnaire regarding the use of iron supplementation, sent to all members of the Norwegian Sheep Recording System (n = 4993), showed that 152/1823 farmers iron-supplemented lambs, either orally (56.7%) or by injection (43.3%). The main purpose of supplementation was to prevent abomasal bloat (38.4%), coccidiosis (9.3%), or both (27.8%). In the field study, 102 twin lambs from five flocks were included: one twin (treated) received 600 mg of gleptoferron subcutaneously within 3 days of birth, whereas the control was given saline. McMaster analysis of individual faecal samples obtained at weekly intervals (n = 4 per lamb, starting at turnout) showed no significant difference in oocyst excretion between treatment groups at any sampling, except for one flock 14 days after turnout. Mean growth rates, measured at iron injection, 21 days after turnout, and in the autumn, differed significantly between treated and untreated lambs from iron injection to 21 days after turnout, however, no difference in growth rates was observed in the overall period from iron injection to autumn. Blood analysis suggested that the controls were at risk of developing iron deficiency anaemia during the housed period, but signs of anaemia were not observed. CONCLUSION: Iron supplementation of lambs was used by 8.3% of the farmers responding to the questionnaire, mainly with the intention to prevent abomasal bloat, coccidiosis, or both.

However further studies, including more flocks and possibly repeated iron injections, would provide more definitive information.

METHODS: Based on the daily reported new cases and the population movement data between January 1 and 31, we examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the geographical expansion of the infection in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan in different scenarios of closing dates. RESULTS: We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of the 2019-nCoV cases. The spatial distribution of cases per unit outflow population indicated that some areas with large outflow population might have been underestimated for the infection, such as Henan and Hunan provinces. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could have been prevented, and if two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger for the transmission of 2019-nCoV infection in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to control the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Kun; Ai, Siqi; Song, Shuxuan; Zhu, Guanghu; Tian, Fei; Li, Huan; Gao, Yuan; Wu, Yinglin; Zhang, Shiyu; Shao, Zhongjun; Liu, Qiyong; Lin, Hualiang","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d1978d524149f8e3af2df2d10fe04a50e5e08ba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302377/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan City","China"],"keyphrases":["Wuhan City","outflowing population","large outflow population","nCoV cases","unit outflow population","population movement data","effects of population outflow","city closure policy","policy of city closure","nCoV infection","city closure measure","nCoV pneumonia infection","spatial distribution of cases","daily reported new cases","transmission","days","cities of China","Hunan provinces","Chinese New Year","global concern","areas","different scenarios of closing dates","geographical expansion","number","large-scale spread","unprecedented outbreak","disease","main reason","positive association","government","important trigger","impacts","Henan","findings","BACKGROUND","METHODS","epidemic","CONCLUSIONS","analysis","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Summary Infectious agent The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a febrile pneumonia initially observed in China at the end of 2002. The infectious agent has rapidly been identified as a new coronavirus, baptised SARS-associated coronavirus (CoV-SARS). Transmission is inter-human, via respiratory particles mainly. Clinical presentation and treatment The clinical presentation is highly variable, from a mild fever to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no specific treatment. Ribavirin associated with steroids have been used with success in numerous cases. Epidemiology During the first half of 2003, the spreading of the virus has been very fast, with a pandemic mode of evolution. More than 8 000 people were infected and 774 died. The reservoir of the virus, which may be animal, is still unknown. The epidemic seems to be controlled, but sporadic or epidemic re-emergences may occur and have been observed in China duting January 2004.","publish_time":"2004-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guihot, Am\u00E9lie; Bricaire, Fran\u00E7ois; Li, Taisheng; Bossi, Philippe","journal":"La Presse M\u00E9dicale","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18c64c68e5d6dd3b209ccf75131f6b6b77ad91da.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0755498204985818; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0755498204985818","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Chine","Guangdong","China"],"keyphrases":["the virus","the spreading","The reservoir","The infectious agent","at the end","treatment The clinical presentation is highly variable","Summary Infectious agent The severe acute respiratory syndrome","The epidemic seems to be controlled","associated coronavirus","Sras","transmission du virus","Epidemiology During the first half","Transmission is inter","new coronavirus","Coronavirus associ\u00E9","nouveau Coronavirus","diss\u00E9mination du virus","is still unknown","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Agent infectieux","agent infectieux \u00E9tiologique","Syndrome respiratoire aigu s\u00E9v\u00E8re","syndrome de d\u00E9tresse respiratoire aigu","baptised SARS","There is no specific treatment","Chine","CoV","ann\u00E9e","mild fever to an acute respiratory distress syndrome","Ribavirin associated with steroids","used with success in numerous cases","respiratory particles mainly","febrile pneumonia initially observed in","which may be animal","epidemic re","pandemic mode","gravit\u00E9 clinique","mode pand\u00E9mique","traitement sp\u00E9cifique","emergences may occur","from","but sporadic","identified as","rapidly","simple fi\u00E8vre","very fast","human","succ\u00E8s","people were infected","pneumopathie f\u00E9brile","r\u00E9-\u00E9mergences sporadiques","origine animale","cortico\u00EFdes","More than","province de Guangdong d\u00E9but","patients","r\u00E9servoir viral","died","premier semestre","contaminant","fin","evolution","duting January","ribavirine combin\u00E9e","particules respiratoires","\u00C9pid\u00E9miologie","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie"],"language":"fr"},

The mechanism of action involves nucleophilic attack by Cys145 present in the active site on the carbonyl carbon of the scissile amide bond of the substrate and the intermediate product is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the residues of the oxyanion hole. Based on the X-ray structure of 3CLPro co-crystallized with a trans-\u03B1,\u03B2-unsaturated ethyl ester (Michael acceptor), a set of QM/QM and QM/MM calculations were performed, yielding three models with increasingly higher the number of atoms. A previous validation step was performed using classical theoretical calculation and PROCHECK software. The Michael reaction studies show an exothermic process with \u22124.5kcal/mol. During the reaction pathway, an intermediate is formed by hydrogen and water molecule migration from a histidine residue and solvent, respectively. In addition, similar with experimental results, the complex between N3 and 3CLPro is 578kcal/mol more stable than N1-3CLPro using Own N-layer Integrated molecular Orbital molecular Mechanics (ONIOM) approach.

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of influenza by collecting randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS We searched PubMed, EMbase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to January 27, 2020 to identify relevant systematic reviews. The RCTs included in systematic reviews were identified. Then we searched the latest published RCTs from the above three databases and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished RCTs. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate pooled estimates by using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS A total of six RCTs involving 9 171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.92-1.28, P \u003E .05), laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.70-1.11), laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.29) and influenzalike illness (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.14) using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). CONCLUSION The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza. It suggests that N95 respirators should not be recommended for general public and nonhigh-risk medical staff those are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Long, Youlin; Hu, Tengyue; Liu, Liqin; Chen, Rui; Guo, Qiong; Yang, Liu; Cheng, Yifan; Huang, Jin; Du, Liang","journal":"Journal of evidence-based medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jebm.12381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167245/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Cochrane Library","ClinicalTrials.gov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RR","use of N95 respirators","effectiveness of N95 respirators","protective effect of N95 respirators","influenza patients","surgical masks","lower risk of laboratory","unpublished RCTs","prevention of influenza","latest published RCTs","Meta-analysis","risk of bias","OBJECTIVE Previous meta-analyses","relevant systematic reviews","suspected patients","nonhigh-risk medical staff","respiratory infection","respiratory viral infections","close contact","general public","databases","bacterial colonization","randomized controlled trials","pooled estimates","PubMed","EMbase","Cochrane Library","insufficient evidence","inception","RevMan","software","influenzalike illness","CONCLUSION","significant differences","METHODS","total","participants","reviewers"],"language":"en"},

The technique that seems most likely to satisfy all of these requirements is the multiplexed suspension (bead-based) assay, which offers a number of advantages over alternative approaches such as ELISAs and microarrays. In a bead based assay, different probe molecules are attached to different beads (of a few tens of microns in size), which are then reacted in suspension with the target sample. After reaction, the beads must be identifiable in order to determine the attached probe molecule, and thus each bead must be labelled (encoded) with a unique identifier. A large number of techniques have been proposed for encoding beads. This critical review analyses each technology on the basis of its ability to fulfil the practical requirements of assays, whilst being compatible with low-cost, high-throughput manufacturing processes and high-throughput detection methods.

However, to date, there has been no systematic surveillance to estimate the burden among pediatric outpatients. METHODS: From August 2010 through July 2014, outpatient health care providers with enumerated patient populations in 13 states and jurisdictions participating in the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project conducted surveillance of patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). Respiratory specimens were collected from the first 10 ILI patients each week with demographic and clinical data. Specimens were tested for multiple respiratory viruses, including PIV1\u20134, using reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction assays. Cumulative incidence was calculated using provider patient population size as the denominator. RESULTS: PIVs 1\u20133 were detected in 8.0% of 7716 ILI-related outpatient specimens: 30% were PIV1, 26% PIV2 and 44% PIV3. PIV circulation varied noticeably by year and type, with PIV3 predominating in 2010\u20132011 (incidence 110 per 100,000 children), PIV1 in 2011\u20132012 (89 per 100,000), dual predominance of PIV2 and PIV3 (88 and 131 per 100,000) in 2012\u20132013 and PIV3 (100 per 100,000) in 2013\u20132014. The highest incidence of PIV detections was among patients aged \u003C5 years (259\u20131307 per 100,000). The median age at detection for PIV3 (3.4 years) was significantly lower than the median ages for PIV1 (4.5 years) and PIV2 (7.0 years; P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PIVs 1\u20133 comprise a substantial amount of medically attended pediatric ILI, particularly among children aged \u003C5 years. Distinct seasonal circulation patterns as well as significant differences in rates by age were observed between PIV types.","publish_time":"2016-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steffens, Andrea; Finelli, Lyn; Whitaker, Brett; Fowlkes, Ashley","journal":"Pediatr Infect Dis J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89122ac5b68dcc5252569b3be17c47f66385b7fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4927308.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000001140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26974891/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project","PIV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["years","PIV3","PIV1","ILI patients","pediatric ILI","surveillance of patients","PIV circulation","Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project","Cumulative incidence","highest incidence of PIV detections","ILI-related outpatient specimens","PIV types","Respiratory specimens","systematic surveillance","pediatric hospitalizations","pediatric outpatients","children","PIVs","multiple respiratory viruses","dual predominance of PIV2","United States","median ages","Parainfluenza viruses","enumerated patient populations","provider patient population size","outpatient health care providers","Distinct seasonal circulation patterns","reverse transcriptase","jurisdictions","significant differences","polymerase chain reaction assays","week","denominator","rates","burden","clinical data","BACKGROUND","illness","date","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Our previous studies have demonstrated that peptides derived from HR2 region could inhibit SARS-CoV entry. However, synthesis of these peptides is at high cost. In this study, we designed two recombinant proteins, one containing two HR1 and one HR2 peptides (denoted HR121), and the other consisting of two HR2 and one HR1 peptides (designated HR212). These two proteins could be easily purified with the low cost of production, exhibiting high stability and potent inhibitory activity on entry of the HIV/SARS pseudoviruses with IC50 values of 4.13 and 0.95\u03BCM, respectively.

Following the disastrous outbreaks in Asia and the United States, PEDV has been detected also in Europe. In order to better understand the overall situation, the molecular epidemiology, and factors that might influence the most variable disease impact; 40 samples from swine feces were collected from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other European countries and sequenced by shot-gun next-generation sequencing. A total of 38 new PEDV complete coding sequences were generated. When compared on a global scale, all investigated sequences from Central and South-Eastern Europe formed a rather homogeneous PEDV S INDEL cluster, suggesting a recent re-introduction. However, in-detail analyses revealed two new clusters and putative ancestor strains. Based on the available background data, correlations between clusters and location, farm type or clinical presentation could not be established. Additionally, the impact of secondary infections was explored using the metagenomic data sets. While several coinfections were observed, no correlation was found with disease courses. However, in addition to the PEDV genomes, ten complete viral coding sequences from nine different data sets were reconstructed each representing new virus strains.

The two only places for conformational ensembles of under\u2010folded (or partially folded) protein forms in this picture were either the end points of the protein denaturation processes or transiently populated folding intermediates. Recent years witnessed dramatic change in this perception and conformational ensembles, which the under\u2010folded proteins are, have moved from the shadow. Accumulated to date data suggest that a protein can exist in at least three global forms\u2013functional and folded, functional and intrinsically disordered (nonfolded), and nonfunctional and misfolded/aggregated. Under\u2010folded protein states are crucial for each of these forms, serving as important folding intermediates of ordered proteins, or as functional states of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs), or as pathology triggers of misfolded proteins. Based on these observations, conformational ensembles of under\u2010folded proteins can be classified as transient (folding and misfolding intermediates) and permanent (IDPs and stable misfolded proteins). Permanently under\u2010folded proteins can further be split into intentionally designed (IDPs and IDPRs) and unintentionally designed (misfolded proteins). Although intrinsic flexibility, dynamics, and pliability are crucial for all under\u2010folded proteins, the different categories of under\u2010foldedness are differently encoded in protein amino acid sequences. \u00A9 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Mice received three administrations of saline with or without Poly(I:C), once every 24 h. The olfactory mucosa was harvested at various intervals after the first administration (8 h, 3, 9 and 24 days). In the Poly(I:C) group, the number of apoptotic cells in the olfactory neuroepithelium had increased at 8 h.

At 24 days, the structure of the neuroepithelium had regenerated almost completely. Regarding the innate immune responses, many neutrophils had infiltrated the olfactory neuroepithelium at 8 h and had exuded into the nasal cavity by 3 days. Macrophages had also infiltrated the olfactory neuroepithelium at 8 h although to a lesser extent, but they still remained in the neuroepithelium at 24 days.

Many different genotypes of IBV are recognized which cause different clinical manifestations. According to the antigenic differences, different serotypes of the virus do not cross-protect. Massachusetts serotype induces the best cross-protection against other serotypes. Recently, the IBV QX genotype has been detected in Iran. QX genotype causes permanent damage to the oviduct in layer and breeder flock if it occurs in the early life cycle. In this study, we compared two vaccination program using 793/B type and Massachusetts type vaccine. One-day-old SPF chickens were divided into four groups. Groups 1 and 2 were unvaccinated groups. Group 3 was vaccinated with the H120 vaccine at day 1 and 793/B at day 14 (eye drop), and group 4 was vaccinated with H120\u002B793/B (eye drop) on the first day and 793/B at day 14. Groups 2, 3, and 4 challenged (oculonasal) with QX genotype (10(4) EID50) at day 35. Five days post challenge, the sample were clollected for ciliostasis test, histopathology, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR from trachea, lung, and kidneys. Results showed that two vaccination programs created more than 80% of protection against challenge virus, but no significant difference was recorded between two programs. Based on our results, it can be concluded that vaccination with two mixed vaccines (H120\u002B793/B) on the first day of the life of a chick does not make any difference in comparison to single vaccine (H120) in reducing of pathological damages and viral load. As long as the second vaccination against IB may not be applied properly in farm situation, applying the mixture of 793/B type vaccine with H120 at day 1 (ocular or spray) may help to increase vaccination program efficacy.","publish_time":"2018-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karimi, Vahid; Mohammadi, Peyman; Ghalyanchilangeroudi, Arash; Ghafouri, Seyed Ali; Hashemzadeh, Masoud; Farahani, Reza Khaltabadi; Maghsouldoo, Hussein; Isakakroudi, Nima","journal":"Trop Anim Health Prod","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e6bdc670f8de6f68e4218c5140677dd620cfc14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088605.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-018-1730-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30374823/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV","IBV QX","QX","Group","IB"],"locations":["Massachusetts","Iran"],"keyphrases":["H120 vaccine","B type vaccine","vaccination programs","Massachusetts type vaccine","IBV QX genotype","day-old SPF chickens","vaccination program efficacy","single vaccine","challenge virus","different serotypes","unvaccinated groups","different genotypes of IBV","eye drop","Infectious bronchitis virus","Results","best cross-protection","different clinical manifestations","significant difference","kidney of chickens","Massachusetts serotype","infectious pathogen","days post challenge","early life cycle","trachea","quantitative real-time RT-PCR","oviduct","layer","histopathology","respiratory tract","sample","reproductive system","permanent damage","mixture","ciliostasis test","lung","pathological damages","comparison","breeder flock","antigenic differences","mixed vaccines","viral load","spray","ocular","farm situation","kidneys","oculonasal","Iran","study","EID50"],"language":"en"},

To control TB effectively, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control implemented the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) in 2006, modeled on the World Health Organization global TB control program. The goal of the program was to reduce the number of TB cases by half within a decade. This study was designed to describe the epidemiology of TB in Taiwan, and to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of the NTP. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of data from the National Tuberculosis Registry System collected between 2002 and 2008. Demographics, geographic distribution of disease, and change in rates of TB incidence and mortality were analyzed. Results From 2002 to 2008, new TB cases declined from 16,758 to 14,265, and incidence decreased from 75 per 100,000 population to 62 per 100,000 population. More than 50% of new cases occurred among elderly adults. Over the study period, TB mortality decreased from 5.7 per 100,000 population to 3.3 per 100,000 population, with over half of TB deaths occurring among patients aged \u2265 65 years. Since the NTP was implemented, from 2005 to 2008, TB incidence and mortality declined by 14% and 23%, respectively. Conclusion TB-associated incidence and mortality decreased over the course of the study. Nevertheless, there continue to be high-incidence areas that show the opposite trend; these areas should strive to improve case management and consultation. In the most populous districts, rigorous surveillance is necessary to track incidence and mortality rate fluctuations.","publish_time":"2011-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lo, Hsiu-Yun; Chou, Pesus; Yang, Shiang-Lin; Lee, Cheng-Yi; Kuo, Hsu-Sung","journal":"Journal of the Formosan Medical Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64a5f586c24d1c76f14c8ca536a675ec6ea1c65c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0929-6646(11)60076-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21783019/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929664611600764; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0929664611600764","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Tuberculosis Program","World Health Organization","NTP","National Tuberculosis Registry System"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TB mortality","rates of TB incidence","epidemiology of TB","new TB cases","number of TB cases","Conclusion TB-associated incidence","half of TB deaths","population","Disease Control","World Health Organization global TB control program","high-incidence areas","NTP","National Tuberculosis Program","new cases","study period","mortality rate fluctuations","Purpose Tuberculosis","Taiwan Centers","retrospective study of data","National Tuberculosis Registry System","important infectious disease","geographic distribution of disease","rigorous surveillance","populous districts","patients","opposite trend","case management","Demographics","elderly adults","Background","decade","course","preliminary effectiveness","consultation","Methods","years","Results","goal"],"language":"en"},

Massive sequestration of leukocytes in the pulmonary microvasculature is a major triggering event of the syndrome. We therefore investigated the potential role of leukocyte stiffness and adhesiveness in the sequestration of leukocytes in microvessels. METHODS: This study was based on in vitro microfluidic assays using patient sera. Cell stiffness was assessed by measuring the entry time (ET) of a single cell into a microchannel with a 6 \u00D7 9\u2013\u03BCm cross-section under a constant pressure drop (\u0394P = 160 Pa). Primary neutrophils and monocytes, as well as the monocytic THP-1 cell line, were used. Cellular adhesiveness to human umbilical vein endothelial cells was examined using the laminar flow chamber method. We compared the properties of cells incubated with the sera of healthy volunteers (n = 5), patients presenting with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE; n = 6), and patients with ARDS (n = 22), of whom 13 were classified as having moderate to severe disease and the remaining 9 as having mild disease. RESULTS: Rapid and strong stiffening of primary neutrophils and monocytes was induced within 30 minutes (mean ET \u003E50 seconds) by sera from the ARDS group compared with both the healthy subjects and the ACPE groups (mean ET \u003C1 second) (p \u003C 0.05). Systematic measurements with the THP-1 cell line allowed for the establishment of a strong correlation between stiffening and the severity of respiratory status (mean ET 0.82 \u00B1 0.08 seconds for healthy subjects, 1.6 \u00B1 1.0 seconds for ACPE groups, 10.5 \u00B1 6.1 seconds for mild ARDS, and 20.0 \u00B1 8.1 seconds for moderate to severe ARDS; p \u003C 0.05). Stiffening correlated with the cytokines interleukin IL-1\u03B2, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor TNF-\u03B1, and IL-10 but not with interferon-\u03B3, transforming growth factor-\u03B2, IL-6, or IL-17. Strong stiffening was induced by IL-1\u03B2, IL-8, and TNF-\u03B1 but not by IL-10, and incubations with sera and blocking antibodies against IL-1\u03B2, IL-8, or TNF-\u03B1 significantly diminished the stiffening effect of serum. In contrast, the measurements of integrin expression (CD11b, CD11a, CD18, CD49d) and leukocyte\u2013endothelium adhesion showed a weak and slow response after incubation with the sera of patients with ARDS (several hours), suggesting a lesser role of leukocyte adhesiveness compared with leukocyte stiffness in early ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: The leukocyte stiffening induced by cytokines in the sera of patients might play a role in the sequestration of leukocytes in the lung capillary beds during early ARDS. The inhibition of leukocyte stiffening with blocking antibodies might inspire future therapeutic strategies.

Ang-(1\u20137) shows actions different from those of AT(1) receptor stimulation, such as vasodilatation, natriuresis, anti-proliferation and an increase in the bradykinin\u2013NO (nitric oxide) system. As the catalytic efficiency of ACE2 is approximately 400-fold higher with Ang II as a substrate than with Ang I, this axis is possibly acting as a counter-regulatory system against the ACE/Ang II/AT(1) receptor axis. The signaling pathway of the ACE2\u2013Ang-(1\u20137) axis has not yet been totally and clearly understood. However, a recent report suggests that the Mas oncogene acts as a receptor for Ang-(1\u20137). Intracellular signaling through Mas is not clear yet. Several factors such as Akt phosphorylation, protein kinase C activation and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibition seem to be involved in this signaling pathway.

Replication-incompetent retroviral vector (retrovector) is an efficient tool to generate stable cell lines. Multiple copies of integrated genes by retrovector transduction results in improved recombinant protein yield. HEK-293 and their genetic derivatives are principal cells for retrovector production. Retrovectors packaged in HEK-293 cells pose a risk of infectious agent transmission, such as viruses and mycoplasmas, from serum and packaging cells. Results In this report, retrovectors were packaged in CHO cells cultured in chemically defined (CD) media. The retrovectors were then used to transduce CHO cells. This method can block potential transmission of infectious agents from serum and packaging cells. With this method, we generated glucagon-like protein-1 Fc fusion protein (GLP-1-Fc) stable expression CHO cell lines. Productivity of GLP-1-Fc can reach 3.15 g/L. The GLP-1-Fc protein produced by this method has comparable bioactivity to that of dulaglutide (Trulicity). These stable cell lines retain 95\u2013100% of productivity after 40 days of continuous culture (~48\u201356 generations).

ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in three motifs: I (DE), II (E), and III (D). Alanine replacement of the motif I residues (AA-E-D; four nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV yields viable mutants with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. Despite these impairments, MHV- and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA with 1, 2, or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or competitive fitness compared to that of MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low-passage-number (passage 10 [P10]) MHV-ExoN-AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate potential multiprotein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses encode an exoribonuclease (ExoN) that is important for viral replication, fitness, and virulence, yet coronaviruses with a defective ExoN (ExoN-AA) have not reverted under diverse experimental conditions. In this study, we identify multiple impediments to MHV-ExoN-AA reversion. We show that ExoN-AA reversion is possible but evolutionarily unfavorable. Instead, compensatory mutations outside ExoN-AA motif I are more accessible and beneficial than partial reversion. We also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term passage partially compensates for ExoN-AA motif I but renders the virus inhospitable to a reverted ExoN. Our results reveal the evolutionary basis for the genetic stability of ExoN-inactivating mutations, illuminate complex functional and evolutionary relationships between coronavirus replicase proteins, and identify potential mechanisms for stabilization of ExoN-AA coronavirus mutants.","publish_time":"2019-07-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Graepel, Kevin W.; Agostini, Maria L.; Lu, Xiaotao; Sexton, Nicole R.; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e997f06260307d229b94ee2742e73e8e06061ddb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6798108.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00711-19; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/20/e00711-19.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341046/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ExoN-AA reversion","ExoN-AA motif","MHV-ExoN","reverted ExoN","nsp14-ExoN","stabilization of ExoN","lack of ExoN","defective ExoN","presence of ExoN","engineered reversion of ExoN","AA-E","genetic stability of ExoN","SARS-CoV ExoN motif","stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants","ExoN catalytic residues","AA coronavirus mutants","AA passage-adaptive mutations","reversion detrimental","partial reversion","competitive fitness","increased replication","nucleotide mutations","impaired replication","viable mutants","profound fitness barriers","viral replication","significant fitness loss","genome replication","results","coronavirus replicase proteins","inactivating mutations","long-term passage","compensatory mutations","low-passage","evolutionary relationships","coevolution","evolutionary basis","attenuated virulence","evolutionary rationale","genetic background","genetic pathways","exoribonuclease","intermediate revertants","potential multiprotein replicase interactions","increased mutation rates","potential mechanisms","nucleotide substitutions","virus inhospitable","IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses","murine hepatitis virus","alternative adaptive pathway","diverse experimental conditions","severe acute respiratory syndrome","future studies","nonstructural protein","RNA proofreading","multiple impediments","environments","number","P10","Alanine replacement","study","motifs","contrast","impairments","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is one of the most powerful tools for this purpose. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the method will depend on the careful selection of genes whose expression are stable and can be used as internal controls for a particular experimental setting. FINDINGS: The expression stability of five commonly used housekeeping genes [beta-actin (ACTB), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1A), ubiquitin (UBQ), glyceraldehyd-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and tubulin alpha (TUBA)] were monitored in salmonid cell lines CHSE-214 and RTS11 after infection with two of the most fastidious fish pathogens, the facultative bacterium Piscirickettsia salmonis and the aquabirnavirus IPNV (Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus). After geNorm analysis, UBQ and EF1A appeared as the most stable, although EF1A was slightly upregulated at late stages of P. salmonis infection in RTS11. ACTB instead, showed a good performance in each case, being always considered within the three most stable genes of the panel. In contrast, infection-dependent differential regulation of GAPDH and TUBA was also demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Based on the data presented here with the cell culture models CHSE-214 and RTS11, we suggest the initial choice of UBQ, ACTB and EF1A as reference genes in qRT-PCR assays for studying the effect of P. salmonis and IPNV on the host immune response.","publish_time":"2010-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pe\u00F1a, Andrea A; Bols, Niels C; Marshall, Sergio H","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43eaa4d7209e389a360aeab2b3b44e76fd89f5c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2873344.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-3-101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20398263/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TUBA","IPNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EF1A","stable genes","salmonis infection","ACTB","RTS11","reference genes","housekeeping genes","qRT-PCR assays","expression stability","careful selection of genes","TUBA","infection-dependent differential regulation of GAPDH","differential gene expression analyses","initial choice of UBQ","fish proteins","aquabirnavirus IPNV","facultative bacterium Piscirickettsia salmonis","tubulin alpha","cell culture models CHSE","study of host immune responses","salmonid cell lines CHSE","Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR","fastidious fish pathogens","limited number of species specific antibodies","Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis Virus","beta-actin","elongation factor","internal controls","phosphate dehydrogenase","late stages of","particular experimental setting","glyceraldehyd","contrast","effect of","ubiquitin","method","data","good performance","geNorm analysis","powerful tools","purpose","case","BACKGROUND","FINDINGS","panel","accuracy","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Purpose To perform a longitudinal study to analyze the serial CT findings over time in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods During January 16 to February 17, 2020, 90 patients (male:female, 33:57; mean age, 45 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled and followed up until they were discharged or died, or until the end of the study. A total of 366 CT scans were acquired and reviewed by 2 groups of radiologists for the patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores and number of zones involved. Those features were analyzed for temporal change. Results CT scores and number of zones involved progressed rapidly, peaked during illness days 6-11 (median: 5 and 5), and followed by persistence of high levels. The predominant pattern of abnormalities after symptom onset was ground-glass opacity (35/78 [45%] to 49/79 [62%] in different periods). The percentage of mixed pattern peaked (30/78 [38%]) on illness days 12-17, and became the second most predominant pattern thereafter. Pure ground-glass opacity was the most prevalent sub-type of ground-glass opacity after symptom onset (20/50 [40%] to 20/28 [71%]). The percentage of ground-glass opacity with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 (14/50 [28%)]) and became the second most prevalent subtype thereafter. The distribution of lesions was predominantly bilateral and subpleural. 66/70 (94%) patients discharged had residual disease on final CT scans (median CT scores and zones involved: 4 and 4), with ground-glass opacity (42/70 [60%]) and pure ground-glass opacity (31/42 [74%]) the most common pattern and subtype. Conclusion The extent of lung abnormalities on CT peaked during illness days 6-11. The temporal changes of the diverse CT manifestations followed a specific pattern, which might indicate the progression and recovery of the illness.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yuhui; Dong, Chengjun; Hu, Yue; Li, Chungao; Ren, Qianqian; Zhang, Xin; Shi, Heshui; Zhou, Min","journal":"Radiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191587/; https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020200843","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background CT","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pure ground-glass opacity","Background CT","median CT scores","total CT scores","illness days","Results CT scores","final CT scans","percentage of ground","diverse CT manifestations","serial CT findings","predominant pattern of abnormalities","irregular linear opacity","patients","specific pattern","common pattern","pneumonia","percentage of mixed pattern","prevalent sub-type of ground","number of zones","distribution of lung abnormalities","extent of lung abnormalities","symptom onset","management of COVID","prevalent subtype","distribution of lesions","longitudinal study","temporal changes","residual disease","central role","patterns","time","diagnosis","years","mean age","female","Conclusion","progression","groups of radiologists","persistence of high levels","subpleural","features","Purpose","recovery","different periods","Materials","Methods","end"],"language":"en"},

Considering the recent increase in the prevalence of the family virus and its risk potential, we investigated the codon usage pattern to understand its evolutionary processes and provide some useful data to develop the medications for most of Flaviviridae viruses. RESULTS: The overall extent of codon usage bias in 65 Flaviviridae viruses is low with the average value of GC contents being 50.5% and the highest value being 55.9%; the lowest value is 40.2%. ENC values of Flaviviridae virus genes vary from 48.75 to 57.83 with a mean value of 55.56. U- and A-ended codons are preferred in the Flaviviridae virus. Correlation analysis shows that the positive correlation between ENC value and GC content at the third nucleotide positions was significant in this family virus. The result of analysis of ENC, neutrality plot analysis, and correlation analysis revealed that codon usage bias of all the viruses was affected mainly by natural selection. Meanwhile, according to correspondence analysis (CoA) based on RSCU and phylogenetic analysis, the Flaviviridae viruses mainly are made up of two groups, Group I (Yellow fever virus, Apoi virus, Tembusu virus, Dengue virus 1, and others) and Group II (West Nile virus lineage 2, Japanese encephalitis virus, Usutu virus, Kedougou virus, and others). CONCLUSIONS: All in, the bias of codon usage pattern is affected not only by compositional constraints but also by natural selection. Phylogenetic analysis also illustrates that codon usage bias of virus can serve as an effective means of evolutionary classification in Flaviviridae virus.","publish_time":"2019-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yao, Huipeng; Chen, Mengyu; Tang, Zizhong","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9a03b8e5d632fb01f973df42763da7fb0179629.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6620835.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31346520/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/5857285","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GC","ENC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["family virus","Apoi virus","Tembusu virus","Usutu virus","Kedougou virus","Dengue virus","codon usage bias of virus","Flaviviridae viruses","Japanese encephalitis virus","Yellow fever virus","ENC values of Flaviviridae virus genes","Correlation analysis","phylogenetic analysis","West Nile virus lineage","bias of codon usage pattern","result of analysis","correspondence analysis","overall extent of codon usage bias","neutrality plot analysis","highest value","lowest value","mean value","positive correlation","positive-sense RNA viruses","average value of GC contents","evolutionary processes","effective means of evolutionary classification","nucleotide positions","human","RSCU","risk potential","useful data","CoA","prevalence","medications","mosquitoes","ticks","groups","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","codons","recent increase","sandflies","compositional constraints","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Hence, this study aims to explore perceived infection routes, influencing factors, psychosocial changes, and management procedures for COVID-19 infected healthcare workers. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, single hospital-based study. We recruited all 105 confirmed COVID-19 healthcare workers in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from February 15 to 29, 2020. All participants completed a validated questionnaire. Electronic consent was obtained from all participants. Perceived causes of infection, infection prevention, control knowledge and behaviour, psychological changes, symptoms and treatment were measured. RESULTS: Finally, 103 professional staff with COVID-19 finished the questionnaire and was included (response rate: 98.1%). Of them, 87 cases (84.5%) thought they were infected in working environment in hospital, one (1.0%) thought their infection was due to the laboratory environment, and 5 (4.9%) thought they were infected in daily life or community environment. Swab of throat collection and physical examination were the procedures perceived as most likely causing their infection by nurses and doctors respectively. Forty-three (41.8%) thought their infection was related to protective equipment, utilization of common equipment (masks and gloves). The top three first symptoms displayed before diagnosis were fever (41.8%), lethargy (33.0%) and muscle aches (30.1%). After diagnosis, 88.3% staff experienced psychological stress or emotional changes during their isolation period, only 11.7% had almost no emotional changes. Arbidol (Umifenovir; an anti-influza drug; 69.2%) was the drug most commonly used to target infection in mild and moderate symptoms. CONCLUSION: The main perceived mode of transmission was not maintaining protection when working at a close distance and having intimate contact with infected cases. Positive psychological intervention is necessary.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Ying-Hui; Huang, Qiao; Wang, Yun-Yun; Zeng, Xian-Tao; Luo, Li-Sha; Pan, Zhen-Yu; Yuan, Yu-Feng; Chen, Zhi-Min; Cheng, Zhen-Shun; Huang, Xing; Wang, Na; Li, Bing-Hui; Zi, Hao; Zhao, Ming-Juan; Ma, Lin-Lu; Deng, Tong; Wang, Ying; Wang, Xing-Huan","journal":"Mil Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3f9e4d7970ddb3a0618b47676cc0da4abec7ac1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7211983.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393381/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-020-00254-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection prevention","perceived infection routes","Perceived causes of infection","infected healthcare workers","psychological changes","infected cases","emotional changes","psychosocial changes","confirmed COVID","working environment","psychological stress","epidemic control","moderate symptoms","community environment","laboratory environment","participants","diagnosis","single hospital-based study","main perceived mode of transmission","Positive psychological intervention","control knowledge","protective equipment","management procedures","Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University","professional staff","validated questionnaire","utilization of common equipment","anti-influza drug","behaviour","factors","physical examination","intimate contact","close distance","Swab of throat collection","protection","Umifenovir","masks","big challenge","coronavirus disease","isolation period","Arbidol","gloves","daily life","CONCLUSION","fever","treatment","lethargy","Electronic consent","response rate","RESULTS","nurses","doctors","BACKGROUND","muscle aches","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

It is highly abundant, its expression is strongly regulated in many tumor entities including lung adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as physiological processes, and it is associated with many RNA binding proteins and highly conserved throughout evolution. The nuclear transcript MALAT-1 has been functionally associated with gene regulation and alternative splicing and its regulation has been shown to impact proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. Here, we have developed a human and a mouse knockout system to study the loss-of-function phenotypes of this important ncRNA. In human tumor cells, MALAT1 expression was abrogated using Zinc Finger Nucleases. Unexpectedly, the quantitative loss of MALAT1 did neither affect proliferation nor cell cycle progression nor nuclear architecture in human lung or liver cancer cells. Moreover, genetic loss of Malat1 in a knockout mouse model did not give rise to any obvious phenotype or histological abnormalities in Malat1-null compared with wild-type animals. Thus, loss of the abundant nuclear long ncRNA MALAT1 is compatible with cell viability and normal development.","publish_time":"2012-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ei\u00DFmann, Moritz; Gutschner, Tony; H\u00E4mmerle, Monika; G\u00FCnther, Stefan; Caudron-Herger, Ma\u00EFwen; Gro\u00DF, Matthias; Schirmacher, Peter; Rippe, Karsten; Braun, Thomas; Diederichs, Sven; Z\u00F6rnig, Martin","journal":"RNA Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e1708119ebab348a08e39cff86b1baeda126ce09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3551862.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22858678/; https://doi.org/10.4161/rna.21089","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MALAT1 expression","genetic loss of Malat1","quantitative loss of MALAT1","Malat1-null","human lung","abundant nuclear long ncRNA MALAT1","lung cancer metastasis","metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript","human tumor cells","nuclear architecture","nuclear transcript MALAT","knockout mouse model","mouse knockout system","liver cancer cells","cell viability","impact proliferation","long non-coding RNA","important ncRNA","tumor entities","gene regulation","cell cycle progression","RNA binding proteins","hepatocellular carcinoma","rise","histological abnormalities","obvious phenotype","apoptosis","migration","normal development","alternative splicing","lncRNA","function phenotypes","Zinc Finger Nucleases","wild-type animals","evolution","physiological processes","invasion","marker"],"language":"en"},

They secrete two digestive enzymes, lingual lipase and amylase. In this investigation, circadian rhythm in feeding was established under a normal 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, with the rats eating primarily during the dark period. At lights on, the size of the acinar cells and the area of the inclusive secretory granules, and the amount of digestive enzyme activity (lingual lipase and amylase) remaining in the gland was significantly less than in the mid-afternoon, after very little daylight food consumption. However, after 7 days of continuous light the circadian rhythm was altered: the food consumption during the normal night-time hours (5 p.m. to 8 a.m.) went from 88% of total 24 h food consumption to 45%, and during normal daylight hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) from 12% to 55%. These changes were correlated with histometric findings of a near reversal of the areas of acinar cells and secretory granules of a.m. and p.m. samples under continuous light. Lingual lipase activity in the glands went from 35% under 12 h light to 61% under continuous light in the a.m. and from 65% to 39% in the p.m. Amylase activity also showed nearly a reversal in activity remaining in the gland, from 36% at 12 h light to 58% at 24 h light in the a.m. and 64% to 41% for the p.m. samples. These results indicate that the von Ebner\u2019s glands of the rat have a circadian rhythm of secretion and storage of secretory proteins that is subject to light entrainment similar to that seen in other exocrine glands such as the parotid and pancreas.","publish_time":"1999-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Field, Ruth B.; Redman, Robert S.; Calloway, Allise M.; Goldberg, William J.","journal":"Archives of Oral Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f0a661112f0919b1aacfd6e08ccbe0e029551ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124357.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003996999000813; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003996999000813","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Von Ebner","von Ebner"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["h light","h food consumption","days of continuous light","Ebner\u2019s glands","Amylase activity","Lingual lipase activity","light entrainment similar","exocrine glands","h dark cycle","secretory granules of","circadian rhythm of secretion","digestive enzyme activity","normal daylight hours","little daylight food consumption","minor salivary serous glands","inclusive secretory granules","normal night-time hours","samples","storage of secretory proteins","areas of acinar cells","near reversal","digestive enzymes","dark period","posterior portion","rats","histometric findings","feeding","size","parotid","mid-afternoon","investigation","changes","tongue","pancreas","results","lights"],"language":"en"},

The widespread adoption of this isothermal molecular tool in many diagnostic fields represents an affordable (approximately 4.3 USD per test), simple (few and easy hands-on steps), fast (results within 5\u201320 min), and sensitive (single target copy number detected) method for the identification of pathogens and the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms in human cancers and genetically modified organisms. CONTENT: This review summarizes the current knowledge on RPA. The molecular diagnostics of various RNA/DNA pathogens is discussed while highlighting recent applications in clinical settings with focus on point-of-care (POC) bioassays and on automated fluidic platforms. The strengths and limitations of this isothermal method are also addressed. SUMMARY: RPA is becoming a molecular tool of choice for the rapid, specific, and cost-effective identification of pathogens. Owing to minimal sample-preparation requirements, low operation temperature (25\u201342 \u00B0C), and commercial availability of freeze-dried reagents, this method has been applied outside laboratory settings, in remote areas, and interestingly, onboard automated sample-to-answer microfluidic devices. RPA is undoubtedly a promising isothermal molecular technique for clinical microbiology laboratories and emergence response in clinical settings.","publish_time":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daher, Rana K; Stewart, Gale; Boissinot, Maurice; Bergeron, Michel G","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13bf2a3550424190192ab486498e1f06241477e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108464.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2015.245829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27160000/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RPA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RPA","isothermal molecular tool","clinical settings","isothermal method","molecular tool of choice","promising isothermal molecular technique","DNA pathogens","cost-effective identification of pathogens","laboratory settings","molecular diagnostics of various RNA","clinical microbiology laboratories","onboard automated sample","automated fluidic platforms","detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms","single target copy number","minimal sample-preparation requirements","human cancers","emergence response","focus","low operation temperature","recent applications","bioassays","POC","point","diagnostic fields","easy hands-on steps","remote areas","commercial availability of freeze-dried reagents","care","review","widespread adoption","modified organisms","current knowledge","recombinase polymerase amplification","USD","test","results","strengths","limitations","microfluidic devices","CONTENT","SUMMARY","BACKGROUND","publications","years"],"language":"en"},

Here, structural characterization reveals that the D3-9 gene segment of S9-3-37 contributes most of the interaction surface with the highly conserved stem epitope on HA. Comparison with other influenza bnAb crystal structures indicates that the D3-9 segment provides a general mechanism for targeting HA stem. Interestingly, such bnAbs can approach the HA stem with vastly different angles and orientations. Moreover, D3-9 can be translated in different reading frames in different bnAbs, yet still target the same HA stem pocket.

Initial mortality was extremely high, but dropped exponentially over time. Influenza viruses have high mutation rates, and H1N1 has undergone significant genetic changes since 1918. The exact nature of H1N1 mutation accumulation over time has not been fully explored. METHODS: We have made a comprehensive historical analysis of mutational changes within H1N1 by examining over 4100 fully-sequenced H1N1 genomes. This has allowed us to examine the genetic changes arising within H1N1 from 1918 to the present. RESULTS: We document multiple extinction events, including the previously known extinction of the human H1N1 lineage in the 1950s, and an apparent second extinction of the human H1N1 lineage in 2009. These extinctions appear to be due to a continuous accumulation of mutations. At the time of its disappearance in 2009, the human H1N1 lineage had accumulated over 1400 point mutations (more than 10% of the genome), including approximately 330 non-synonymous changes (7.4% of all codons). The accumulation of both point mutations and non-synonymous amino acid changes occurred at constant rates (\u03BC = 14.4 and 2.4 new mutations/year, respectively), and mutations accumulated uniformly across the entire influenza genome. We observed a continuous erosion over time of codon-specificity in H1N1, including a shift away from host (human, swine, and bird [duck]) codon preference patterns. CONCLUSIONS: While there have been numerous adaptations within the H1N1 genome, most of the genetic changes we document here appear to be non-adaptive, and much of the change appears to be degenerative. We suggest H1N1 has been undergoing natural genetic attenuation, and that significant attenuation may even occur during a single pandemic. This process may play a role in natural pandemic cessation and has apparently contributed to the exponential decline in mortality rates over time, as seen in all major human influenza strains. These findings may be relevant to the development of strategies for managing influenza pandemics and strain evolution.","publish_time":"2012-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carter, Robert W; Sanford, John C","journal":"Theor Biol Med Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e53306862eb2cab646ba36a1e685fdb5a392da42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3507676.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23062055/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4682-9-42","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1 influenza","human H1N1 lineage","sequenced H1N1 genomes","significant genetic changes","exact nature of H1N1 mutation accumulation","non-synonymous changes","time of codon","human population","point mutations","continuous accumulation of mutations","major human influenza strains","influenza pandemics","Influenza viruses","entire influenza genome","new mutations","natural genetic attenuation","non-synonymous amino acid changes","mortality rates","high mutation rates","constant rates","known extinction","comprehensive historical analysis of mutational changes","significant attenuation","natural pandemic cessation","single pandemic","multiple extinction events","continuous erosion","Initial mortality","codon preference patterns","duck","development of strategies","bird","specificity","swine","role","exponential decline","shift","strain evolution","numerous adaptations","RESULTS","host","BACKGROUND","disappearance","findings","process","years","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","codons","extinctions"],"language":"en"},

The term \u2018emerging infectious disease\u2019 was coined in the mid-1900s to describe changes in disease dynamics in the modern era. Both the term and the phenomena it is meant to characterize have evolved and diversified over time, leading to inconsistencies and confusion. Here, we review the evolution of the term \u2018emerging infectious disease\u2019 (EID) in the literature as applied to human hosts. We examine the pathways (e.g., speciation or strain differentiation in the causative agent vs. rapid geographic expansion of an existing pathogen) by which diseases emerge. We propose a new framework for disease and pathogen emergence to improve prioritization. And we illustrate how the operational definition of an EID affects conclusions concerning the pathways by which diseases emerge and the ecological and socioeconomic drivers that elicit emergence. As EIDs appear to be increasing globally, and resources for science level off or decline, the research community is pushed to prioritize its focus on the most threatening diseases, riskiest potential pathogens, and the places they occur. The working definition of emerging infectious diseases and pathogens plays a crucial role in prioritization, but we argue that the current definitions may be impeding these efforts. We propose a new framework for classifying pathogens and diseases as \u201Cemerging\u201D that distinguishes EIDs from emerging pathogens and novel potential pathogens. We suggest prioritization of: 1) EIDs for adaptation and mitigation, 2) emerging pathogens for preventive measures, and 3) novel potential pathogens for intensive surveillance.","publish_time":"2015-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosenthal, Samantha R.; Ostfeld, Richard S.; McGarvey, Stephen T.; Lurie, Mark N.; Smith, Katherine F.","journal":"One Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fef395624ecfc1747991a5cb4b9b2282aeac208.json; document_parses/pdf_json/512a5c594e648dfad69c623f2c567328dfb69b1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5441331.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2015.08.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771415000051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28616460/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352771415000051","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging pathogens","emergence of pathogens","novel potential pathogens","riskiest potential pathogens","working definition of emerging infectious diseases","threatening diseases","EIDs","term","prioritization","disease dynamics","pathogen emergence","new framework","pathways","existing pathogen","operational definition","human hosts","causative agent","rapid geographic expansion","decline","strain differentiation","changes","conclusions","preventive measures","crucial role","speciation","intensive surveillance","mitigation","science level","modern era","socioeconomic drivers","research community","resources","literature","focus","adaptation","places","evolution","Microbial infections","time","inconsistencies","confusion","current definitions","efforts","phenomena"],"language":"en"},

In the past, enteroviruses (EV) were considered the most common cause of myocarditis in all age groups. Other viruses that cause myocarditis are adenovirus and influenza viruses.

Members of the Herpesviridae family, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV\u20106) have been associated occasionally with myocarditis. During an atypical outbreak of acute febrile syndrome, eight children, with ages from 5 months to 15 years, died in cardiogenic shock due to myocarditis in July\u2013August 2005, in the city of Havana, Cuba. Nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) and nested reverse transcription\u2010PCR (nRT\u2010PCR) were carried out on fresh heart muscle and lung tissue to analyze the genomic sequences of adenovirus, CMV, HHV\u20106, herpes simplex virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), varizella zoster virus, influenza virus A, B, C, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronavirus, flaviruses and enteroviruses.

However, the impact of respiratory viruses could have been underestimated because of the low detection rate by conventional laboratory methods. METHODS: Children with CF had nasal swabs and sputum samples obtained on a routine basis and when they developed respiratory exacerbations. Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) was used to detect respiratory viruses from nasal swabs. The definition of a respiratory exacerbation was when the symptom score totalled to 4 or more, or if the peak expiratory flow fell by more than 50 l/min from the child\u0027s usual best value, or if the parent subjectively felt that the child was developing a cold. RESULTS: 71 patients had 165 reported episodes of respiratory exacerbations. 138 exacerbation samples were obtained of which 63 (46%) were positive for respiratory viruses. In contrast, 23 of 136 asymptomatic nasal swabs (16.9%) were positive for respiratory viruses. There was significantly more viruses being detected during respiratory exacerbations, in particular influenza A, influenza B and rhinovirus (p \u003C 0.05). Upper respiratory symptoms significantly correlated with positive respiratory viral detection (p \u003C 0.05). This study also showed that viral respiratory exacerbations in CF could be independent from bacterial infections.

The detection of BDV in diseased animals, mainly sheep and horses, is achieved by histological, immunohistochemical and serological approaches and/or PCR-based technologies. In the present study, reverse transcription, real-time PCR assays were established for the detection of BDV in the brain tissue from sheep and horses, using loci for the p40 (nucleoprotein) and the p24 (phosphoprotein) genes. The PCRs were equally specific and sensitive, detecting 10 target molecules per reaction and one BDV-infected cell among 10(6) non-infected cells. In tissues from BDV-diseased sheep and horses, the p24 target was detected at higher abundance than for p40. Therefore, the p24 test is suggested to be of higher value in the diagnostic laboratory. However, both assays should be useful for addressing questions in pathogenesis and for detecting BDV reservoirs in endemic areas.","publish_time":"2006-08-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schindler, A.R.; V\u00F6gtlin, A.; Hilbe, M.; Puorger, M.; Zlinszky, K.; Ackermann, M.; Ehrensperger, F.","journal":"Mol Cell Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/185dd95e212398394200f18a0e93ca1f81c58700.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127217.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850806000557; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850806000557","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of BDV","BDV-diseased sheep","BDV reservoirs","horses","BDV-infected cell","p24 target","p24 test","p40","real-time PCR assays","Borna disease virus","diseased animals","target molecules","higher abundance","higher value","PCR-based technologies","non-infected cells","immunopathological disorder","infection","reverse transcription","central nervous system","reaction","brain tissue","present study","serological approaches","pathogenesis","nucleoprotein","questions","loci","immunohistochemical","diagnostic laboratory","phosphoprotein","endemic areas","tissues","PCRs"],"language":"en"},

Despite its putative role in viral RNA replication, nsP13 readily unwinds duplex DNA by cooperative translocation. Herein, nsP13 exhibited different characteristics in duplex RNA unwinding than that in duplex DNA. nsP13 showed very poor processivity on duplex RNA compared with that on duplex DNA. More importantly, nsP13 inefficiently unwinds duplex RNA by increasing the 5\u2032-ss tail length. As the concentration of nsP13 increased, the amount of unwound duplex DNA increased and that of unwound duplex RNA decreased. The accumulation of duplex RNA/nsP13 complexes increased as the concentration of nsP13 increased. An increased ATP concentration in the unwinding of duplex RNA relieved the decrease in duplex RNA unwinding. Thus, nsP13 has a strong affinity for duplex RNA as a substrate for the unwinding reaction, which requires increased ATPs to processively unwind duplex RNA. Our results suggest that duplex RNA is a preferred substrate for the helicase activity of nsP13 than duplex DNA at high ATP concentrations.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jang, Kyoung-Jin; Jeong, Seonghwan; Kang, Dong Young; Sp, Nipin; Yang, Young Mok; Kim, Dong-Eun","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7066239.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161317/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61432-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unwinding of duplex RNA","duplex RNA unwinding","unwound duplex RNA","accumulation of duplex RNA","unwound duplex DNA","concentration of nsP13","viral RNA replication","SCV nsP13","nsP13 complexes","helicase activity of nsP13","increased ATP concentration","increased ATPs","unwinding reaction","central role","preferred substrate","putative role","high ATP concentrations","single-stranded tail","ss tail length","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nonstructural protein","decrease","strong affinity","superfamily","different characteristics","poor processivity","cooperative translocation","results","direction"],"language":"en"},

During the past decades, it has been revealed that numerous pathogens, including viruses, usurp autophagy in order to promote their propagation. Nidovirales are an order of enveloped viruses with large single-stranded positive RNA genomes. Four virus families (Arterividae, Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae, and Roniviridae) are part of this order, which comprises several human and animal pathogens of medical and veterinary importance. In host cells, Nidovirales induce membrane rearrangements including autophagosome formation. The relevance and putative mechanism of autophagy usurpation, however, remain largely elusive. Here, we review the current knowledge about the possible interplay between Nidovirales and autophagy.","publish_time":"2017-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cong, Yingying; Verlhac, Pauline; Reggiori, Fulvio","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d82c429737f250a7bcd230fea2e4725edc2439a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5537674.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v9070182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28696396/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Nidovirales","order of enveloped viruses","putative mechanism of autophagy usurpation","membrane rearrangements","host cells","numerous pathogens","animal pathogens of medical","specialized double-membrane vesicles","degradation of deleterious components","conserved intracellular catabolic pathway","Coronaviridae","homeostasis","possible interplay","positive RNA genomes","Arterividae","Mesoniviridae","veterinary importance","autophagosomes","relevance","autophagosome formation","virus families","current knowledge","Roniviridae","propagation","past decades"],"language":"en"}]}

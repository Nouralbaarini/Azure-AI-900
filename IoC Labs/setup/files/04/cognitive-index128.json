The festival results in a drop of air pollutant emissions that causes dramatic changes of atmospheric composition over China\u0027s most polluted regions. Based on satellite and in-situ measurements for the years 2005-2019 over 50 cities in eastern China, we find that the atmospheric NO2 pollution dropped by ~40% during the SF week, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decreased by ~30% in the following week, reflecting the effectiveness of precursor emission controls on the mitigation of secondary PM2.5 formation. However, although human activity and emissions are at the lowest level, air pollution over eastern China during the SF still far exceeds that over other worldwide pollution hotspots. Our analyses suggest that measures based solely on end-of-pipe controls and industry upgrades may not suffice to meet air quality goals. Further cleaning of the air in China depends fundamentally on sustainable advances in both heavy industry upgrades and clean energy transition.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Siwen; Su, Hang; Streets, David G.; Zhang, Qiang; Lu, Zifeng; He, Kebin; Andreae, Meinrat O.; Poschl, Ulrich; Cheng, Yafang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08442v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["air pollution","SF week","eastern China","drop of air pollutant emissions","Human migration","air quality goals","atmospheric NO2 pollution","largest collective human activity","heavy industry upgrades","worldwide pollution hotspots","pipe controls","festival results","following week","Chinese Spring Festival","mitigation of secondary PM2","dramatic changes of atmospheric composition","effectiveness of precursor emission controls","percent","China\u0027s","kind","lowest level","sustainable advances","clean energy transition","fine particulate matter","earth\u0027s land surface area","polluted regions","situ measurements","years","end","formation","cities","modern era","measures","satellite","world population","cleaning","analyses"],"language":"en"},

We use two variations of the SIR model and we include a parameter that comprises the effects of social distancing measures. Short and Long terms forecasts show that the social distancing policy imposed by the government is able to flatten the pattern of infection of the COVID-19. However, our results also show that if this policy does not last enough time, it is only able to shift the peak of infection into the future keeping the value of the peak in almost the same value. Furthermore, our long term simulations forecast the optimal date to end the policy. Finally, we show that the proportion of asymptomatic individuals affects the amplitude of the peak of symptomatic infected, suggesting that it is important to test the population.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bastos, Saulo B.; Cajueiro, Daniel O.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72c620280862116945a1b4a5076f5dbd53ca2c6a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14288v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["social distancing policy","peak of infection","effects of social distancing measures","peak of symptomatic infected","disease","COVID","value","timely introduction of social distancing policies","pattern of infection","early evolution","SIR model","Long terms forecasts","long term simulations","early period accounts","real numbers of infected people","pandemic","sub-notification","amplitude","unawareness","epidemiological characteristics","new territory","optimal date","government","Brazilian recent data","parameter","spread","future","proportion of asymptomatic individuals","variations","population","results"],"language":"en"},

Buildings hosting the continuous presence of the same users and significant overcrowd conditions over space/time (e.g. large offices, universities) are critical scenarios due to the prolonged contact with infectors. Beside individual\u0027s risk-mitigation strategies performed (facial masks), stakeholders should promote additional strategies, i.e. occupants\u0027 load limitation (towards\u0022social distancing\u0022) and access control. Simulators could support the measures effectiveness evaluation. This work provides an Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in the closed built environment. The model adopts a probabilistic approach to jointly simulate occupants\u0027 movement and virus transmission according to proximity-based and exposure-time-based rules proposed by international health organizations. Scenarios can be defined in terms of building occupancy, mitigation strategies and virus-related aspects. The model is calibrated on experimental data (\u0022Diamond Princess\u0022cruise) and then applied to a relevant case-study (a part of a university campus). Results demonstrate the model capabilities. Concerning the case-study, adopting facial masks seems to be a paramount strategy to reduce virus spreading in each initial condition, by maintaining an acceptable infected people\u0027s number. The building capacity limitation could support such measure by potentially moving from FFPk masks to surgical masks use by occupants (thus improving users\u0027 comfort issues). A preliminary model to combine acceptable mask filters-occupants\u0027 density combination is proposed. The model could be modified to consider other recurring scenarios in other public buildings (e.g. tourist facilities, cultural buildings).","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u0027Orazio, Marco; Bernardini, Gabriele; Quagliarini, Enrico","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e46cba4a75160e2ad71419dd44e07f68783d462.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12927v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjszNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preliminary model","model capabilities","Agent-Based Model","facial masks","FFPk masks","surgical masks","virus transmission","cultural buildings","public buildings activities","additional strategies","occupants\u0027 movement","occupants\u0027 load limitation","based rules","critical scenarios","recurring scenarios","individual\u0027s risk-mitigation strategies","building capacity limitation","relevant case-study","acceptable mask filters-occupants\u0027 density combination","exposure-time","operational measures","terms of building occupancy","measures effectiveness evaluation","acceptable infected people\u0027s number","space","social distancing","large offices","universities","proximity","tourist facilities","experimental data","virus-related aspects","international health organizations","Diamond Princess","emergency","conditions","prolonged contact","phase","probabilistic approach","stakeholders","continuous presence","initial condition","paramount strategy","users\u0027 comfort issues","cruise","access control","Simulators","closed built environment","work","COVID","infectors","Results","university campus"],"language":"en"},

With vaporization, the three masks were associated with different dry residue weights (P \u003C .03 with the Kruskal-Wallis test at both flow rates), the respirator providing the lowest amount. The respirator provided an efficiency of 94 to 96 percent, compared with 90 to 92 percent and 85 to 86 percent for the molded and tie-on surgical masks, respectively. Conclusions These data provide independent evidence that a certified personal respirator can be more effective than high-quality surgical masks in dental settings. Clinical Implications Dentists should be aware that a certified particulate respirator can provide them with superior filtering protection.","publish_time":"2005-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"CHECCHI, LUIGI; MONTEVECCHI, MARCO; MORESCHI, ANNALISA; GRAZIOSI, FRANCESCA; TADDEI, PAOLA; VIOLANTE, FRANCESCO SAVERIO","journal":"The Journal of the American Dental Association","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd1217361ab14e65057a7b87d32fd866248186fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7093848.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002817714630555; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002817714630555","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM1LmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1634406,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:23Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"TCPXhqOSA1HrV1c0/DptRA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_35.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["certified particulate respirator","molded mask","tie-on mask","airflow rates","certified personal respirator","tie-on surgical masks","surgical face masks","certified personal particulate respirator","high-quality surgical masks","percent","authors","bicarbonate particulate","hour","vaporization","superior filtering protection","different dry residue weights","dentist\u0027s head","mannequin head","separate runs","significant weight gains","Clinical Implications Dentists","relative filtering efficacy","independent evidence","porcelain surface","cubic meters","dental settings","Kruskal-Wallis test","data","m3","control","ABSTRACT Background Up-to-date studies","patient\u0027s mouth","Conclusions","centimeters","Methods","tube","Results","aerosol","efficiency","single manufacturer"],"language":"en"},

CT imaging has been used as a complementary tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid identification of COVID-19 cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases. The main challenge in early screening is how to model the confusing cases in the COVID-19 and CAP groups, with very similar clinical manifestations and imaging features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Uncertainty Vertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify COVID-19 from CAP using CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including regional features and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for each case. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a hypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph. The uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score measurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process of the vertex-weighted hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case belongs to COVID-19 or not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia dataset, consisting of 2,148 COVID-19 cases and 1,182 CAP cases from five hospitals, are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

The current diagnostic procedure of COVID-19 follows reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based approach which however is less sensitive to identify the virus at the initial stage. Hence, a more robust and alternate diagnosis technique is desirable. Recently, with the release of publicly available datasets of corona positive patients comprising of computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) imaging; scientists, researchers and healthcare experts are contributing for faster and automated diagnosis of COVID-19 by identifying pulmonary infections using deep learning approaches to achieve better cure and treatment. These datasets have limited samples concerned with the positive COVID-19 cases, which raise the challenge for unbiased learning. Following from this context, this article presents the random oversampling and weighted class loss function approach for unbiased fine-tuned learning (transfer learning) in various state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as baseline ResNet, Inception-v3, Inception ResNet-v2, DenseNet169, and NASNetLarge to perform binary classification (as normal and COVID-19 cases) and also multi-class classification (as COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal case) of posteroanterior CXR images.

Since these interventions applied at the societal level cannot be evaluated through traditional experimental means, public health officials and other decision makers must rely on statistical and mathematical epidemiological models. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are typically focused on contacts between members of a population, and yet most epidemiological models rely on homogeneous mixing which has repeatedly been shown to be an unrealistic representation of contact patterns. An alternative approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time intensive and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know the effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window using limited resources. This paper presents an estimation algorithm for an IBM designed to evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions. By utilizing recursive relationships, our method can quickly compute the expected epidemiological outcomes even for large populations based on any arbitrary contact network.

The audio signal, created using a novel nanomechanical sonification method, features an overlay of the vibrational signatures of the protein\u0027s primary, secondary and higher-order structures. Presenting musical encoding in two versions - one in the amino-acid scale and one based on equal temperament tuning - the method allows for expressing protein structures in audible space, offering novel avenues to represent, analyze and design architectural features across length- and time-scales. We further report a hierarchical frequency spectrum analysis of five distinct protein structures, which offer insights into how genetic mutations, and the binding of the virus spike protein to the human ACE2 cell receptor directly influence the audio. Applications of the approach may include the development of de novo antibodies by designing protein sequences that match, through melodic counterpoints, the binding sites in the spike protein. Other applications of audible coding of matter include material design by manipulating sound, detecting mutations, and offering a way to reach out to broader communities to explain the physics of proteins. It also forms a physics-based compositional technique to create new art, referred to as materiomusic, which is akin to finding a new palette of colors for a painter.

The standard\u0022compartment\u0022models of the spread of disease through a population follow the law of mass action; that is, the rate of conversion of individuals from one compartment to another is directly proportional to the number of individuals in the former. The basic S-I-R model, which tracks susceptible, infectious, and recovered people, is functionally identical to autocatalytic reactions studied in chemical kinetics. However, if we account for heterogeneity in individuals\u0027 susceptibility to catch the disease, then the most susceptible individuals are likely to be removed from the pool early; this is analogous to evaporative cooling in chemical kinetics. Here, we use standard tools from statistical physics to account for this effect, which suggest that the rate of appearance of new cases should be proportional to the \\emph{square} of the number of susceptible people in the population, not the first power. We validate this finding with both Monte Carlo (stochastic) and many-compartment differential equation (deterministic) simulations. This leads to quite different predictions of the peak infection rate and final outbreak size, with the second-order model giving milder predictions of each. This has dramatic effects on the extrapolation of a disease\u0027s progression when the data collected comes from the early, exponential-like region, and may remove a systematic bias from such models.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peterson, Andrew A.; Goldsmith, C.

Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal propagation of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global locations. Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related to population migration from Hubei resembling a L\\\u0027{e}vy flight which is characteristic of human mobility and thus could be controlled by efficient quarantines. Since quarantine is usually applied on a city level, more insight can be obtained in analyzing the epidemic in cities. Our results suggest that the disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is close to constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant differences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations. While most cities in China control the disease which resulted in the decaying stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse probably due to less social interactions control and overloaded health systems which reflects in the death and recovery rates.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gross, Bnaya; Zheng, Zhiguo; Liu, Shiyan; Chen, Xiaoqi; Sela, Alon; Li, Jianxin; Li, Daqing; Havlin, Shlomo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0deef7e050171f0fb38e0d0733c9de67298891f7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08382v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2Mjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["China","disease propagation","COVID","city level","world-wide locations","cities","results","means","social interactions control","spatio-temporal propagation","infection signs","infection rate","world-wide countries","social distancing","later times","early times","stages process","global locations","efficient quarantines","overloaded health systems","vy flight","population migration","characteristic of human mobility","death","infected individuals","order","days","decaying stage","significant differences","lack","Hubei","situation","recovery rates","vaccination","medicine","new coronavirus","insight","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, such an assumption is implausible when there is progressive interference from other targets and/or background noise, which produce sub-peaks on the tracking response map and cause model drift. In this paper, we propose a rectified online learning approach for sub-peak response suppression and peak response enforcement and target at handling progressive interference in a systematic way. Our approach, referred to as SPSTracker, applies simple-yet-efficient Peak Response Pooling (PRP) to aggregate and align discriminative features, as well as leveraging a Boundary Response Truncation (BRT) to reduce the variance of feature response. By fusing with multi-scale features, SPSTracker aggregates the response distribution of multiple sub-peaks to a single maximum peak, which enforces the discriminative capability of features for robust object tracking. Experiments on the OTB, NFS and VOT2018 benchmarks demonstrate that SPSTrack outperforms the state-of-the-art real-time trackers with significant margins.","publish_time":"2019-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Qintao; Zhou, Lijun; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Mao, Yao; Zhang, Jianlin; Ye, Qixiang","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75570407f08bd39d157fdffb8fad4d51fc36e926.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00597v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NFS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peak response enforcement","sub-peak response suppression","efficient Peak Response Pooling","tracking response map","variance of feature response","Boundary Response Truncation","response distribution of multiple sub-peaks","discriminative features","single maximum peak","discriminative capability of features","SPSTracker","assumption","rectified online learning approach","online learning models","handling progressive interference","multi-scale features","Gaussian distribution","state-of-the-art real-time trackers","robust object tracking","Modern visual trackers","NFS","cause model drift","PRP","VOT2018 benchmarks","OTB","significant margins","targets","systematic way","BRT","background noise","Experiments","paper"],"language":"en"},

This study investigated how government formed reactive policies to fight coronavirus across its policy sectors. Primary data was collected from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) in the form press releases of government plans, policies, programme initiatives and achievements. A text corpus of 260,852 words was created from 396 documents from the PIB. An unsupervised machine-based topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was performed on the text corpus. It was done to extract high probability topics in the policy sectors. The interpretation of the extracted topics was made through a nudge theoretic lens to derive the critical policy heuristics of the government. Results showed that most interventions were targeted to generate endogenous nudge by using external triggers. Notably, the nudges from the Prime Minister of India was critical in creating herd effect on lockdown and social distancing norms across the nation. A similar effect was also observed around the public health (e.g., masks in public spaces; Yoga and Ayurveda for immunity), transport (e.g., old trains converted to isolation wards), micro, small and medium enterprises (e.g., rapid production of PPE and masks), science and technology sector (e.g., diagnostic kits, robots and nano-technology), home affairs (e.g., surveillance and lockdown), urban (e.g. drones, GIS-tools) and education (e.g., online learning).

We validate our theoretical predictions with experimental data for Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg, and compare them with the predictions of the logistic model. We find that our predictions are in good agreement with the real world since the beginning of the appearance of the COVID-19; this is not the case for the logistic model that only applies to the first days. The second part of the work is devoted to modeling the descending phase, i.e. the decrease of the number of people tested positive for COVID-19. Also in this case, we propose a new set of dynamic differential equations that we solved numerically. We use our differential equations parametrized with experimental data to make several predictions, such as the date when Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg will reach a peak number of COVID-19 infected people.

Notably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an exponential phase. The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out recently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic was contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries like, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other European countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first countries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems to follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local case.

A pure BPS Skyrme model description of neutron stars, however, only describes the neutron star core, by construction. Here we consider different possibilities to extrapolate a BPS Skyrme neutron star at high baryon density to a description valid at lower densities. In the exact field-theoretic case, a simple effective description of the neutron star crust can be used, because the exact BPS Skyrme neutron star solutions formally extend to sufficiently low densities. In the mean-field case, on the other hand, the BPS Skyrme neutron star solutions always remain above the nuclear saturation density and, therefore, must be joined to a different nuclear physics equation of state already for the outer core.

Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most.","publish_time":"2020-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Linda; Wong, Alexander","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e2cb8e30cb7f94777dcd408097f0f85483561c8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09871v4.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CXR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID cases","detection of COVID","available COVID","open access COVID-Net","CXR images","open source efforts","open source COVIDx dataset","open source network designs","patient patient cases","positive cases","open access benchmark dataset","improved screening","best","authors\u0027 knowledge","key screening approaches","chest X-ray","chest radiography","critical factors","effective screening of infected patients","critical step","deep convolutional neural network design","practical deep learning solutions","radiology examination","hope","largest number","health","well-being","development","research community","deeper insights","devastating effect","production-ready solution","attempt","explainability method","time of initial release","relevant information","fight","predictions","study","clinicians","citizen data scientists","description","general public","researchers","means","global population","transparent manner","pandemic","decisions","treatment"],"language":"en"},

This novel virus leads to pneumonia, which is an infection that inflames the lungs\u0027 air sacs of a human. One of the methods to detect those inflames is by using x-rays for the chest. In this paper, a pneumonia chest x-ray detection based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) with a fine-tuned deep transfer learning for a limited dataset will be presented. The use of GAN positively affects the proposed model robustness and made it immune to the overfitting problem and helps in generating more images from the dataset. The dataset used in this research consists of 5863 X-ray images with two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. This research uses only 10% of the dataset for training data and generates 90% of images using GAN to prove the efficiency of the proposed model. Through the paper, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Squeeznet, and Resnet18 are selected as deep transfer learning models to detect the pneumonia from chest x-rays. Those models are selected based on their small number of layers on their architectures, which will reflect in reducing the complexity of the models and the consumed memory and time. Using a combination of GAN and deep transfer models proved it is efficiency according to testing accuracy measurement. The research concludes that the Resnet18 is the most appropriate deep transfer model according to testing accuracy measurement and achieved 99% with the other performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score while using GAN as an image augmenter. Finally, a comparison result was carried out at the end of the research with related work which used the same dataset except that this research used only 10% of original dataset.

Our model, that we call SUDR\u002BK, is based on usual SIR model, but it splits the total fraction of infected individuals into two components: those that are undetected and those that are detected through tests. Moreover, we assume that available tests increase at a constant rate from the beginning of epidemics but are consumed to detect infected individuals. Strikingly we find a bi-stable behavior between a phase with a giant fraction of infected and a phase with a very small fraction. We show that the separation between these two regimes is governed by a match between the rate of testing and a rate of infection spread at given time. We also show that the existence of two phases does not depend on the mathematical choice of the form of the term describing the rate at which undetected individuals are tested and detected. Presented research implies that a vigorous early testing activity, before the epidemics enters into its giant phase, can potentially keep epidemics under control, and that even a very small change in rate of testing can increase or decrease the size of the whole epidemics of various orders of magnitude. For the real application of realistic model to ongoing epidemics, we would gladly collaborate with field epidemiologists in order to develop quantitative models of testing process.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zlati\u0027c, Vinko; Barjavsi\u0027c, Irena; Kadovi\u0027c, Andrea; vStefanvci\u0027c, Hrvoje; Gabrielli, Andrea","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66c553c2b07c0ffeaf870d043705928fef176cc5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08479v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUDR K"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rate of testing","ongoing epidemics","dependence epidemics","beginning of epidemics","constant rate","rate of infection","giant fraction of infected","giant phase","epidemics of various orders of magnitude","toy model","total fraction of infected individuals","small fraction","undetected individuals","usual SIR model","availability of tests","available tests","quantitative models of testing process","vigorous early testing activity","real application of realistic model","small change","various responses of world governments","COVID","form","term","components","field epidemiologists","bi-stable behavior","mathematical choice","research","match","size","phases","regimes","disease","time","existence","separation","SUDR","control"],"language":"en"},

However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only $n$ nodes are observed at a time and the most central between these $n$ nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until $1-p$ fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this approach and determine the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ and the size of the giant component $P_{\\infty}$ for networks with arbitrary degree distributions $P(k)$. In the limit of $n\\to\\infty$ we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for $n=1$ we recover the known case of random failure. Between these two extremes, we observe that as $n$ increases, $p_c$ increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between $|p_c(\\infty)-p_c(n)|$ and $n$ as $|p_c(\\infty)-p_c(n)|\\sim n^{-1}\\exp(-\\alpha n)$. For Scale-free (SF) networks, where $P(k)\\sim k^{-\\gamma}, 2\u003C\\gamma\u003C3$, we find that $p_c$ has a transition from zero to non-zero when $n$ increases from $n=1$ to order of $\\log N$ ($N$ is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, knowledge of order of $\\log N$ nodes and immunizing them can reduce dramatically an epidemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Yangyang; Sanhedrai, Hillel; Dong, GaoGao; Shekhtman, Louis M.; Wang, Fan; Buldyrev, Sergey V.; Havlin, Shlomo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46c97f10f1565b2587a04f19a70300530f639872.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00825v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["log N","sim n","alpha n","optimal nodes","Targeted immunization","SF networks","infty","fraction of nodes","increases","targeted attack","knowledge of order","attacks of large-scale networks","size of network","gamma","novel immunization strategy","optimal value","significant attention","approach","critical percolation threshold","arbitrary degree distributions","observations","new scaling relationship","prior work","complete information","giant component","known case of random failure","scientific community","real-world scenarios","Scale-free","transition","current COVID","analytical framework","time","exp","assessment","limit","epidemics","process","extremes"],"language":"en"},

The questions we address are these: (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much? (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place order, prevent the overflow of capacity? (3) When should such strategies be implemented? Our answers are as follows: (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor of ten. (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but even that will not work if implemented too late. (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19 can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the emergency situation. In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties in computer simulation. But there is high confidence in the main conclusion that it exists and will soon be closed. Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs, there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation/lockdown implemented in the next week at the latest. If this window is missed, the epidemic will get worse and then strong mitigation/lockdown will be required after all, but it will be too late.","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maslov, Sergei; Goldenfeld, Nigel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c169e8515eb37b7ab9e7cc972eaf66e4d55bace.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.09564v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Chicago"],"keyphrases":["strong mitigation strategies","lockdown","ICU capacity","Chicago","ICU beds","overflow of capacity","epidemic","closing window of opportunity","emergency situation","growth of COVID","emerging COVID","main conclusion","state-of-the-art computer simulations","precise dates","place order","SARS-CoV","inherent uncertainties","shelter","demand","worst-case scenario","high confidence","number of deaths","societal trade-offs","probability","virus","week","Italy","factor","days","questions","answers"],"language":"en"},

In the absence of proper vaccination and treatment, to reduce the number of infections and casualties, the only option so far is to educate people regarding preventive measures and to enforce countrywide lock-down. Any strategy about the preventive measures needs to be based upon detailed analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak and accurate scientific predictions. In this paper, we conduct mathematical and numerical analysis to come up with reliable and accurate predictions of the outbreak in Pakistan. The time-dependent Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is used to fit the data and provide future predictions. The turning point of the peak of the pandemic is defined as the day when the transmission rate becomes less than the recovering rate. We have predicted that the outbreak will reach its maximum peak occurring from late May to 9 June with unrecovered number of Infectives in the range 20000-47000 and the cumulative number of infected cases in the range of 57500-153100. The number of Infectives will remain at the lower end in the lock-down scenario but can rapidly double or triple if the spread of the epidemic is not curtailed and localized.

However, given the substantial increase in patient volume, the quantity of materials requiring disinfection exceeds the UV-C equipment throughput capabilities at many medical facilities. Therefore, there is a need for a UV-C disinfection system that can be rapidly deployed. In response to this demand, we designed, constructed, and validated a UV-C disinfection system from readily accessible components; specifically, a plastic bin, UV-C light bulb and conventional light housing. To further improve the performance, the interior of the tub was spray-painted with chrome paint, forming a low quality-factor (Q) Fabry-Perot optical cavity. As part of this work, a set of modular design criteria which allows for flexibility in component selection without degradation of UV-C dose performance is established. This flexibility is critical given the current fluctuating availability of source materials.

How then do we isolate these \\textit{invisible} pre-symptomatic spreaders? Here we propose an alternating quarantine strategy, in which at every instance, half of the population remains under lock-down while the other half continues to be active, maintaining a routine of weekly succession between activity and quarantine. Under this regime, if an individual was exposed during their active week, by the time they complete their quarantine they will, in most cases, begin to exhibit symptoms. Hence this strategy isolates the majority of pre-symptomatic individuals during their infectious phase, leading to a rapid decline in the viral spread - all while sustaining a continuously active economy at $50\\%$ capacity.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meidan, Dror; Schulamann, Nava; Cohen, Reuven; Haber, Simcha; Yaniv, Eyal; Sarid, Ronit; Barzel, Baruch","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b923a8fc7d406d0f149ecd5293d1a72dec7ee526.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01453v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["active economy","alternating quarantine strategy","symptomatic patients","pre-symptomatic spreaders","majority of pre-symptomatic individuals","current strategy","active week","half","symptoms","lock-downs","viral spread","infectious phase","mobility restrictions","social distancing","rapid decline","selective isolation","routine of weekly succession","activity","textit","pandemic","SARS-CoV","hurtful toll","long incubation period","COVID","drug","vaccine","population","instance","time","extended periods","measures","challenge","cases","regime","capacity"],"language":"en"},

The current strategy for test-kit allocation is mostly rule-based, focusing on individuals having (a) symptoms for COVID-19, (b) travel history or (c) contact history with confirmed COVID-19 patients. Such testing strategy may miss out on detecting asymptomatic individuals who got infected via community spread. Thus, it is important to allocate a separate budget of test-kits per day targeted towards preventing community spread and detecting new cases early on. In this report, we consider the problem of allocating test-kits and discuss some solution approaches. We believe that these approaches will be useful to contain community spread and detect new cases early on. Additionally, these approaches would help in collecting unbiased data which can then be used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models trained to predict COVID-19 infections.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Biswas, Arpita; Bannur, Shruthi; Jain, Prateek; Merugu, Srujana","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/41ce72cb8df0bc21b693f002e6957342c589f7b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01740v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["community spread","increasing spread of COVID","confirmed COVID","problem of allocating test-kits","separate budget of test","test-kit allocation","solution approaches","new cases","contact history","travel history","current strategy","testing strategy","asymptomatic individuals","day","accuracy of machine learning models","patients","unbiased data","symptoms","report","infections","people"],"language":"en"},

To avoid HFNC failure and intubation delay, the key issues are proper patients, timely application and improving compliance. It should be noted that elder patients are vulnerable for failed HFNC. We applied HFNC for oxygen therapy in severe and critical ill COVID-19 patients and summarized the following experiences. Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed. Secondly, an initial \uE555ow of 60 L/min and 37\u2103 should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased. Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease. Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Guojun; Han, Yijiao; Fang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianying; Shen, Jifang; Li, Tong; Pu, Qibin; Chen, Aijun; Qi, Zhiyang; Sun, Lijun; Cai, Hongliu","journal":"Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

In this paper, we develop a model that tries to explain and describe the temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of respiratory droplets and their possible connection in determining viral outbreaks. The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the infected population based on a reaction mechanism - the final equations of which are similar to the well-known SIR model. The advantage of modeling the pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision rate theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation time accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer and finally crystallization of the salt. The model output favourably compares with the experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model. Droplet evaporation/desiccation time is indeed dependent on ambient temperature and relative humidity, considered at both outdoor and indoor conditions. Since the droplet evaporation time determines the infection rate constant, ambient temperature and relative humidity are shown to impact the outbreak growth rates.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi; Kabi, Prasenjit; Unni, Vishnu R.; Saha, Abhishek","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85df303b9475f6bab04727eb745959c330293de9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10929v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["droplet evaporation time","ambient temperature","model output","relative humidity sensitivity of respiratory droplets","salt solution droplets","infection rate constant","rate constants","respiratory droplets responsible","evaporation time accounting","respiratory droplet lifetime","well-known SIR model","ambient conditions","droplet cooling","collision rate theory","evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of pure water","desiccation time","reaction mechanism","pandemic","local outbreaks","viral outbreaks","indoor conditions","outbreak growth rates","heat","disease transmission","mass transfer","possible connection","infected population","Covid","crystallization","final equations","sound physical interpretation","function","fidelity","unresolved questions","advantage","paper","parts"],"language":"en"},

The manifold aspects that have been raised, as well as their redundancy offer precious information that has been underexploited and needs to be critically re-evaluated, appropriately used and offered to the whole community, from scientists, to medical doctors, stakeholders and common people. These efforts will favour a holistic view on the comprehension, prevention and development of strategies (pharmacological, clinical etc) as well as common intervention against the new coronavirus spreading. Here we describe a model that emerged from our analysis that was focused on the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) and the possible routes linking it to the viral infection. because the infection is mediated by the viral receptor on human cell membranes Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2), which is a key component in RAS signalling. The model depicts the main pathways determining the disease and the molecular framework for its establishment, and can help to shed light on mechanisms involved in the infection. It promptly gives an answer to some of the controversial, and still open, issues concerning predisposing conditions and medical treatments that protect from or favour the severity of the disease (such as the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs/sartans), or to the sex related biases in the affected population.

Based on this broad quantitative framework it may be posited that the spectrum of symptomatic to severely symptomatic presentations of COVID19 represents the balance between innate and adaptive immune responses. In asymptomatic patients, prompt and adequate adaptive immune response quells infection, whereas in those with severe symptoms a slower inadequate adaptive response leads to a runaway cytokine cascade fueled by ongoing viral replication. Polymorphisms in the various components of the innate and adaptive immune response may cause altered immune response kinetics that would result in variable severity of illness. Understanding how this genetic variation may alter the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to develop successful treatment strategies.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krieger, Elizabeth; Vissichelli, Nicole; Leichtle, Stefan; Kashioris, Markos; Sabo, Roy; Brophy, Don; Wang, Xiang-Yang; Kimbal, Pamela; Neale, Michael; Serrano, Myrna G.; Buck, Gregory A.; Roberts, Catherine; Qayyum, Rehan; Nixon, Daniel; Grossman, Steven; Toor, Amir A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92ad49b0070748ba8621527a5241ad9a2c111908.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06541v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune response genes","adequate adaptive immune response","altered immune response kinetics","adaptive immune responses","slower inadequate adaptive response","SARS-CoV","genetic variation","genetic differences","severe symptoms","severe disease","genetic variants","control of infection","host factors","asymptomatic patients","cytokine storm","quantitative analysis","spectrum of symptomatic","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","runaway cytokine cascade","symptomatic presentations of COVID19","ongoing viral replication","magnitude of viral growth","variable clinical presentation","variable severity of illness","broad quantitative framework","balance","prompt","dynamical systems model","various components","HLA","pathogen","successful treatment strategies","KIR allotypes","mortality rates","globe","Polymorphisms"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to determine whether alternative testing strategies based on sample pooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A mathematical modelling approach was chosen to simulate six different testing strategies based on key input parameters (infection rate, test characteristics, population size, testing capacity etc.). The situations in five countries (US, DE, UK, IT and SG) currently experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks were simulated to reflect a broad variety of population sizes and testing capacities. The primary study outcome measurements that were finalised prior to any data collection were time and number of tests required; number of cases identified; and number of false positives. Findings: The performance of all tested methods depends on the input parameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen one tenth of each country\u0027s population at an infection rate of 1% - e.g. when prioritising frontline medical staff and public workers -, realistic optimised testing strategies enable such a campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy and 10 in Germany (ca. eight times faster compared to individual testing). When infection rates are considerably lower, or when employing an optimal, yet logistically more complex pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. Pool-based approaches also reduces the number of false positive diagnoses by 50%. Interpretation: The results of this study provide a clear rationale for adoption of pool-based testing strategies to increase speed and throughput of testing for SARS-CoV-2. The current individual testing approach unnecessarily wastes valuable time and resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wolff, Timo de; Pfluger, Dirk; Rehme, Michael; Heuer, Janin; Bittner, Martin-Immanuel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2ed14bc0e1e302886110f07e1bbcc88cbc3e28d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.11851v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Singapore"],"keyphrases":["throughput of testing","based testing strategies","testing capacities","testing capacity","Rapid testing","different testing strategies","alternative testing strategies","realistic optimised testing strategies","current individual testing approach","number of tests","number of cases","infection rates","number of false positives","Pool-based approaches","speed","country\u0027s population","throughput of screening","number of false positive diagnoses","SARS-CoV","screening campaign","US","UK","key input parameters","broad variety of population sizes","valuable time","sample pooling","adoption of pool","tested methods","primary study outcome measurements","complex pooling method","mathematical modelling approach","test characteristics","public workers","continued viral spread","excess morbidity","pandemic","clear rationale","specific circumstances","frontline medical staff","mortality","gains","data collection","performance","results","countries","resources","times","Background","Italy","COVID","Germany","outbreaks","Findings","Singapore","SG","situations","Interpretation","days"],"language":"en"},

The disease spreads all over the world within a very short period of time after its first identification in Wuhan, China in December, 2019. In India, the outbreaks starts on $2^{nd}$ March, 2020 and after that the cases are increasing exponentially. Very high population density, the unavailability of specific medicines or vaccines, insufficient evidences regarding the transmission mechanism of the disease also make it difficult to fight against the disease properly in India. Mathematical models have been used to predict the disease dynamics and also to assess the efficiency of the intervention strategies in reducing the disease burden. In this work, we propose a mathematical model to describe the disease transmission mechanism between the individuals. We consider the initial phase of the outbreak situation in India and our proposed model is fitted to the daily cumulative new reported cases during the period $2^{nd}$ March, 2020 to $24^{th}$ March, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number $(R_0)$, effective reproduction number (R(t)) and epidemic doubling time from the incidence data for the above-mentioned period. We further assess the effect of preventive measures such as spread of awareness, lock-down, proper hand sanitization, etc. in reducing the new cases. Two intervention scenarios are considered depending on the variability of the intervention strength over the period of implementation. Our study suggests that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak within a shorter period of time in India. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the strength of the intervention should be strengthened over the time to eradicate the disease effectively.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Senapati, Abhishek; Rana, Sourav; Das, Tamalendu; Chattopadhyay, Joydev","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ecd7a7b8f4ee30892a89cc84de8aa055f22e0ec.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04950v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsxNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","India"],"keyphrases":["disease outbreak","disease burden","disease dynamics","disease spreads","disease transmission mechanism","India","outbreak of corona virus disease","intervention strength","shorter period of time","short period of time","above-mentioned period","period of implementation","intervention strategies","intervention scenarios","new cases","higher intervention effort","outbreak situation","epidemic doubling time","world","effective reproduction number","basic reproduction number","daily cumulative new reported cases","proposed model","Mathematical models","virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","unavailability of specific medicines","vaccines","insufficient evidences","incidence data","awareness","lock","high population density","SARS-CoV","identification","proper hand sanitization","initial phase","country","Wuhan","efficiency","study","variability","COVID","individuals","effect of preventive measures","emergency situations","China","work","outbreaks","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Avoiding person-to-person transmission is an effective approach to control and prevent the epidemic. However, many daily activities, such as logistics transporting goods in our daily life, inevitably involve person-to-person contact. To achieve contact-less goods transportation, using an autonomous logistic vehicle has become the preferred choice.

An agile, scalable and cost-effective testing, deployable at a global scale, can act as a game changer in this war. To address this challenge, building on the promising results of our prior work on cough-based diagnosis of a motley of respiratory diseases, we develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based test for COVID-19 preliminary diagnosis. The test is deployable at scale through a mobile app named AI4COVID-19. The AI4COVID-19 app requires 2-second cough recordings of the subject. By analyzing the cough samples through an AI engine running in the cloud, the app returns a preliminary diagnosis within a minute. Unfortunately, cough is common symptom of over two dozen non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the COVID-19 diagnosis from cough alone an extremely challenging problem. We solve this problem by developing a novel multi-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture that minimizes misdiagnosis. At the time of writing, our AI engine can distinguish between COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with over 90% accuracy. AI4COVID-19\u0027s performance is likely to improve as more and better data becomes available. This paper presents a proof of concept to encourage controlled clinical trials and serves as a call for labeled cough data. AI4COVID-19 is not designed to compete with clinical testing. Instead, it offers a complementing tele-testing tool deployable anytime, anywhere, by anyone, so clinical-testing and treatment can be channeled to those who need it the most, thereby saving more lives.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imran, Ali; Posokhova, Iryna; Qureshi, Haneya N.; Masood, Usama; Riaz, Sajid; Ali, Kamran; John, Charles N.; Nabeel, Muhammad; Hussain, Iftikhar","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/809572ae170df1c479bf13f406ea8ac7e2045eb4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01275v5.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Artificial Intelligence"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cough-based diagnosis","cough data","AI4COVID","cough recordings","cough samples","clinical testing","clinical-testing","dozen non-COVID","types of non-COVID","AI engine","preliminary diagnosis","based test","cost-effective testing","global scale","complementing tele-testing tool deployable","mobile app","risk-averse AI architecture","controlled clinical trials","patient coughs","challenging problem","better data","humanity\u0027s ongoing war","novel multi-pronged mediator","prior work","Achille\u0027s heel","motley of respiratory diseases","Artificial Intelligence","related medical conditions","promising results","proof of concept","common symptom","cloud","s performance","misdiagnosis","time of writing","pandemic","game changer","challenge","paper","subject","minute","treatment","accuracy","Inability","lives"],"language":"en"},

The key innovation of our proposed strategy is its ability to recruit stochastic effects such as spontaneous extinction and fluctuations in timing to contain the epidemic, even when infection numbers in the population as a whole are not small and their spatial distribution is unknown. It involves partitioning the population into smaller isolated sub-populations within which, while social distancing is practiced as much as possible to reduce the contact rate, a relatively normal lifestyle is maintained. As a rule of thumb, the optimal size of the sub-populations can be obtained by dividing the total population size by the best estimate of the number of infected individuals at the time of the implementation of this containment strategy.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bittihn, Philip; Golestanian, Ramin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8cde2c7961989749f62222db85c69951981ceea5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08784v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection numbers","strategy of containment","containment strategy","stochastic fluctuations","total population size","proposed strategy","stochastic effects","mild social distancing measures","optimal size","smaller isolated sub-populations","best estimate","number of infected individuals","time","restrictive lockdown strategies","spontaneous extinction","contact rate","timing","implementation","ability","epidemic","normal lifestyle","spatial distribution","rule of thumb","key innovation","spread","observation"],"language":"en"},

Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease Mpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies have identified a set of existing, small-molecule drugs as potent Mpro inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one), a glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly attractive. Recent experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than that of other molecules that also act at the enzyme catalytic site. By relying on extensive simulations with all-atom models, in this study we examine at a molecular level the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro catalytic activity. Our results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the catalytic site cavity of Mpro. In addition, our molecular models reveal a second, previously unkown binding site for Ebselen in the dimerization region localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed analysis of the free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen to this second binding site is in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic site. A strain analysis indicates that Ebselen bound between the II-III domains exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access through surface loop interactions, and induces a displacement and reconfiguration of water hotspots, including the catalytic water, which could interfere with normal enzymatic function. Taken together, these findings provide a framework for the future design of more potent and specific Mpro inhibitors, based on the Ebselen scaffold, that could lead to new therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menendez, Cintia A.; Bylehn, Fabian; Perez-Lemus, Gustavo R.; Alvarado, Walter; Pablo, Juan J. de","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efd0db816c414f8900dac9b53bc6a89da90fd00a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09805v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["catalytic site cavity of Mpro","affinity of Ebselen","catalytic site access","enzyme catalytic site","catalytic water","Mpro catalytic activity","potential of Ebselen","Ebselen scaffold","unkown binding site","potent Mpro inhibitors","specific Mpro inhibitors","design of drugs","SARS-CoV","SARS-coronavirus","main protease Mpro","molecular models","COVID","domains","small-molecule drugs","free energy of binding","distinct affinity","future design","molecular level","attractive candidate","Recent experiments","detailed analysis","new virus","Coronavirus Disease","strain analysis","all-atom models","reconfiguration of water hotspots","new therapeutic strategies","Recent high-throughput screening studies","proteolytic processing","set of existing","surface loop interactions","pronounced allosteric effect","glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound","displacement","study","extensive simulations","pandemic","essential role","dimerization region","effectiveness","framework","fact","similar coronaviruses","normal enzymatic function","molecules","findings","addition","Phenyl","results","benzoselenazol","protein"],"language":"en"},

I show that these variations are strongly correlated with the levels of the ACE2 protein in the lungs but surprisingly, despite ACE2 is the viral receptor, higher levels lead to lower fatality. This behaviour is consistent with a previous mathematical model that predicts that the speed of viral progression in the organism has a maximum and then declines with the receptor level. SARS-Cov-2 degrades ACE2 and thus worsens lung injury, causes vasoconstriction, thrombotic problems, and exacerbated inflammatory response. I developed a mathematical model based on the influence of ACE2 on viral propagation and on the negative effects of its degradation. The model fits SARS-CoV-2 fatality rate across age and gender with high accuracy ($r^2\u003E0.9$). Rescaling the model parameters with the binding rates of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 allows predicting the fatality rate of SARS-CoV across age and gender, in particular its higher severity for young patients, thus linking the molecular and epidemiological levels. These results support the suggestion that drugs that enhance the expression of ACE2, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, constitute a promising therapy against the most adverse effects of CoViD-19. Furthermore, ACE2 is a candidate prognostic factor for detecting population that needs stronger protection.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bastolla, Ugo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07224v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjsyNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fatality rate of SARS","model fits SARS-CoV","influence of ACE2","expression of ACE2","ACE2 protein","age","viral receptor","spike proteins of SARS","higher levels","lower fatality","model parameters","previous mathematical model","gender","viral propagation","receptor level","epidemiological levels","angiotensin receptor blockers","speed of viral progression","higher severity","negative effects","adverse effects of CoViD","thrombotic problems","promising therapy","binding rates","ACE inhibitors","population","young patients","lung injury","high accuracy","candidate prognostic factor","vasoconstriction","organism","drugs","suggestion","inflammatory response","behaviour","lungs","stronger protection","women","results","degradation","variations"],"language":"en"},

This requires an mRNA sequence that is stable and highly productive in protein expression, features which have been shown to benefit from greater mRNA secondary structure folding stability and optimal codon usage. However, sequence design remains a hard problem due to the exponentially many synonymous mRNA sequences that encode the same protein. We show that this design problem can be reduced to a classical problem in formal language theory and computational linguistics that can be solved in O(n^3) time, where n is the mRNA sequence length. This algorithm could still be too slow for large n (e.g., n = 3, 822 nucleotides for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2), so we further developed a linear-time approximate version, LinearDesign, inspired by our recent work, LinearFold. This algorithm, LinearDesign, can compute the approximate minimum free energy mRNA sequence for this spike protein in just 11 minutes using beam size b = 1, 000, with only 0.6% loss in free energy change compared to exact search (i.e., b = \u002Binfinity, which costs 1 hour).

Market expectations plummeted, foreshadowing the risk of a global economic crisis and mass unemployment. Governments provide huge financial aid programmes to mitigate the economic shocks. To achieve higher effectiveness with such policy measures, it is key to identify the industries that are most in need of support. In this study, we introduce a data-mining approach to measure industry-specific risks related to COVID-19. We examine company risk reports filed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This alternative data set can complement more traditional economic indicators in times of the fast-evolving crisis as it allows for a real-time analysis of risk assessments. Preliminary findings suggest that the companies\u0027 awareness towards corona-related business risks is ahead of the overall stock market developments. Our approach allows to distinguish the industries by their risk awareness towards COVID-19. Based on natural language processing, we identify corona-related risk topics and their perceived relevance for different industries. The preliminary findings are summarised as an up-to-date online index. The CoRisk-Index tracks the industry-specific risk assessments related to the crisis, as it spreads through the economy. The tracking tool is updated weekly. It could provide relevant empirical data to inform models on the economic effects of the crisis.

While social distancing and isolation has been introduced widely, more moderate contact reduction policies could become desirable owing to adverse social, psychological, and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown. Adopting a novel social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three targeted distancing strategies designed to \u0027keep the curve flat\u0027 and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. We simulate stochastic infection curves that incorporate core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models, and statistical relational event models. Our models demonstrate that while social distancing measures clearly do flatten the curve, strategic reduction of contact can strongly increase their efficiency, introducing the possibility of allowing some social contact while keeping risks low. Limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts emerges as the most effective strategy. Maintaining similarity across contacts and the strengthening of communities via triadic strategies are also highly effective. This approach provides empirical evidence which adds nuanced policy advice for effective social distancing that can mitigate adverse consequences of social isolation.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Block, Per; Hoffman, Marion; Raabe, Isabel J.; Dowd, Jennifer Beam; Rahal, Charles; Kashyap, Ridhi; Mills, Melinda C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3324f2015b89803fa67a6ee320989fcf848a6345.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07052v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social contact","effective social distancing","social distancing measures","adverse consequences of social isolation","novel social network approach","ideal-type social network models","infection models","effective strategy","targeted distancing strategies","strategic reduction of contact","complete lockdown","statistical relational event models","moderate contact reduction policies","economic consequences","curve flat","triadic strategies","repeated contacts","importance of effective non-pharmaceutical public health interventions","stochastic infection curves","post-lockdown world","desirable owing","nuanced policy advice","core elements","aid compliance","empirical evidence","effectiveness","strengthening of communities","pandemic","possibility","risks low","COVID","interaction","similarity","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

Despite efforts to carefully monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, the reported number of confirmed cases is likely to underestimate the actual number of infections. We aim to estimate the total number of COVID-19 infections in a straightforward manner using a demographic scaling model. This model is broadly applicable as it is based on little input data: deaths attributable to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection fatality rates, and life tables. As many countries lack reliable estimates of age-specific infection fatality rates, we map them from a reference country onto countries of interest based on remaining life expectancy. This scaling accounts for cross-country differences in the age structure, the health status, and the health care system. We also introduce easy to apply formulas to quantify the bias that would be required in death counts and infection fatality rates in order to reproduce a certain estimate of infections. Across the 10 countries with most COVID-19 deaths as of April 17, 2020, our estimates suggest that the total number of infected is approximately 4 times the number of confirmed cases. The uncertainty, however, is high, as the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval suggests on average twice as many infections than confirmed cases, and the upper bound 10 times as many. Comparing our results with findings from local seroprevalence studies and applying our bias formulas shows that some of their infection estimates would only be possible if just a small fraction of COVID-19 related deaths were recorded, indicating that these seroprevalence estimates might not be representative for the total population.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bohk-Ewald, Christina; Dudel, Christian; Myrskyla, Mikko","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/beb8755f44c3beabc781dcb6af963ecb101117ef.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12836v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjszODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["total number of COVID","infection estimates","actual number of infections","total number of infected","reported number of confirmed cases","small fraction of COVID","seroprevalence estimates","countries","specific infection fatality rates","certain estimate of infections","total population","reliable estimates of age","deaths attributable","related deaths","pandemic","times","bias formulas","demographic scaling model","age structure","health status","scaling accounts","life tables","local seroprevalence studies","health care system","remaining life expectancy","order","straightforward manner","cross-country differences","decision makers","little input data","critical information","death counts","implications","progress","results","findings","prediction interval","average","policy options","reference country","uncertainty","efforts"],"language":"en"},

In this research article, we identify public sentiment associated with the pandemic using Coronavirus specific Tweets and R statistical software, along with its sentiment analysis packages. We demonstrate insights into the progress of fear-sentiment over time as COVID-19 approached peak levels in the United States, using descriptive textual analytics supported by necessary textual data visualizations. Furthermore, we provide a methodological overview of two essential machine learning (ML) classification methods, in the context of textual analytics, and compare their effectiveness in classifying Coronavirus Tweets of varying lengths. We observe a strong classification accuracy of 91% for short Tweets, with the Naive Bayes method. We also observe that the logistic regression classification method provides a reasonable accuracy of 74% with shorter Tweets, and both methods showed relatively weaker performance for longer Tweets.

Nevertheless, they commonly exhibit considerable sensitivity to some input parameters\u0027 variance which results in large fluctuations in the generated projections, thus rendering predictions difficult and even risky. In this work we examine a novel meta-projections-based approach which allows us to evaluate the model\u0027s current trends and assess whether generated projections are at a transient or stable state. Meta-projections can be extracted from graphs of successive estimations of model\u0027s parameters and resulting projections, over a sequence of days being gradually added to the employed model. In other words, projections are carried out on truncated time series of cumulative numbers of confirmed cases with increased lengths at each successive evaluation. This allows us to trace the values of model parameters over a certain period of time and examine their trends which may converge to specific values for settled-growth cases or exhibit a changing or even an erratic behavior for cases that undergo epidemiological transitions and/or are inappropriately described by the current model instance(s). We have computed meta-projections and compared our findings for countries at different stages of the epidemic with stable or unstable behaviors and increasing or decreasing numbers of confirmed cases. Our results indicate that meta-projections can aid researchers in assessing the appropriateness of their relevant models and in effect decrease the uncertainty in their estimations of an epidemic\u0027s severity and development.","publish_time":"2020-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xydas, Evagoras; Kostas, Konstantinos","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd1fc67354d8605c8c93d6b2d35d3bb2d7ab7431.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12398v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["generated projections","novel meta-projections-based approach","growth cases","employed model","values of model parameters","development","model\u0027s current trends","current model instance","Researchers","results","truncated time series of cumulative numbers of confirmed cases","graphs of successive estimations of model\u0027s parameters","relevant models","epidemic\u0027s severity","successive evaluation","specific values","stable state","biological growth modeling","simple empirical models","certain period of time","severity of ongoing epidemics","increased lengths","input parameters\u0027 variance","large fluctuations","different stages","potential","countries","findings","affected population","erratic behavior","useful information","points","timing","considerable sensitivity","effect","uncertainty","unstable behaviors","size","predictions difficult","epidemiological transitions","best","appropriateness","work","sequence of days","worst-case scenarios","tools","words"],"language":"en"},

It is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China. It has been seen that fewer children contract COVID-19 and among infected, children have less severe disease. Insights in pathophysiological mechanisms of less severity in children could be important for devising therapeutics for high-risk adults and elderly. Early closing of schools and day-care centers led to less frequent exposure and hence, lower infection rate in children. The expression of primary target receptor for SARS-CoV-2, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), decreases with age. ACE-2 has lung protective effects by limiting angiotensin-2 mediated pulmonary capillary leak and inflammation. Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with high and persistent viral loads in adults. Children have strong innate immune response due to trained immunity (secondary to live-vaccines and frequent viral infections), leading to probably early control of infection at the site of entry. Adult patients show suppressed adaptive immunity and dysfunctional over-active innate immune response in severe infections, which is not seen in children. These could be related to immune-senescence in elderly. Excellent regeneration capacity of pediatric alveolar epithelium may be contributing to early recovery from COVID-19. Children, less frequently, have risk factors such as co-morbidities, smoking, and obesity. But young infants and children with pre-existing illnesses could be high risk groups and need careful monitoring. Studies describing immune-pathogenesis in COVID-19 are lacking in children and need urgent attention.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dhochak, Nitin; Singhal, Tanu; Kabra, S.

However, human NK cell responses in acute influenza infection, including infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, are poorly documented. Here, we examined changes in NK cell phenotype and function and plasma cytokine levels associated with influenza infection and vaccination. We show that absolute numbers of peripheral blood NK cells, and particularly those of CD56(bright) NK cells, decreased upon acute influenza infection while this NK cell subset expanded following intramuscular influenza vaccination. NK cells exposed to influenza antigens were activated, with higher proportions of NK cells expressing CD69 in study subjects infected with seasonal influenza strains. Vaccination led to increased levels of CD25\u002B NK cells, and notably CD56(bright) CD25\u002B NK cells, whereas decreased amounts of this subset were present in the peripheral blood of influenza infected individuals, and predominantly in study subjects infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Finally, acute influenza infection was associated with low plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03B3, MIP-1\u03B2, IL-2 and IL-15, and high levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1ra. Altogether, these data suggest a role for the CD56(bright) NK cell subset in the response to influenza, potentially involving their recruitment to infected tissues and a local production and/or uptake of inflammatory cytokines.","publish_time":"2011-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jost, Stephanie; Quillay, Heloise; Reardon, Jeff; Peterson, Eric; Simmons, Rachel P.; Parry, Blair A.; Bryant, Nancy N.

Host-directed therapy (HDT) is an emerging approach in the field of anti-infectives. The strategy behind HDT is to interfere with host cell factors that are required by a pathogen for replication or persistence, to enhance protective immune responses against a pathogen, to reduce exacerbated inflammation and to balance immune reactivity at sites of pathology. Although HDTs encompassing interferons are well established for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis, novel strategies aimed at the functional cure of persistent viral infections and the development of broad-spectrum antivirals against emerging viruses seem to be crucial. In chronic bacterial infections, such as tuberculosis, HDT strategies aim to enhance the antimicrobial activities of phagocytes and to curtail inflammation through interference with soluble factors (such as eicosanoids and cytokines) or cellular factors (such as co-stimulatory molecules). This Review describes current progress in the development of HDTs for viral and bacterial infections, including sepsis, and the challenges in bringing these new approaches to the clinic.

Obviously, slightly salted aqueous solutions containing low concentrations of a biomolecule of interest are too simplistic to mimic the \u201Creal life\u201D situation, where the biomolecule of interest scrambles and wades through the tightly packed crowd. In laboratory practice, such macromolecular crowding is typically mimicked by concentrated solutions of various polymers that serve as model \u201Ccrowding agents\u201D. Studies under these conditions revealed that macromolecular crowding might affect protein structure, folding, shape, conformational stability, binding of small molecules, enzymatic activity, protein-protein interactions, protein-nucleic acid interactions, and pathological aggregation. The goal of this review is to systematically analyze currently available experimental data on the variety of effects of macromolecular crowding on a protein molecule. The review covers more than 320 papers and therefore represents one of the most comprehensive compendia of the current knowledge in this exciting area.","publish_time":"2014-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuznetsova, Irina M.; Turoverov, Konstantin K.; Uversky, Vladimir N.","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b87ddf92d90fd58bbdf08981116cd7841d75d483.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4284756.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms151223090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25514413/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein-protein interactions","macromolecular crowding","protein structure","protein molecule","crowding agents","protein-nucleic acid interactions","biomolecule","review","salted aqueous solutions","concentrated solutions of various polymers","binding of small molecules","enzymatic activity","variety of effects","conformational stability","current knowledge","low concentrations","shape","crowded milieu","complete lack of unoccupied space","free water","available experimental data","wades","pathological aggregation","model","real life","intracellular environment","comprehensive compendia","exciting area","scrambles","situation","conditions","laboratory practice","packed crowd","Studies","goal","papers"],"language":"en"},

The porcine intestinal epithelial cell is the PEDV target cell. In this study, we established a porcine intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line which can stably express PEDV N protein. We also investigate the subcellular localization and function of PEDV N protein by examining its effects on cell growth, cycle progression, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression, and survival. The results show that the PEDV N protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), inhibits the IEC growth and prolongs S-phase cell cycle. The S-phase is prolonged which is associated with a decrease of cyclin A transcription level and an increase of cyclin A degradation. The IEC expressing PEDV N protein can express higher levels of IL-8 than control cells. Further studies show that PEDV N protein induces ER stress and activates NF-\u03BAB, which is responsible for the up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression. This is the first report to demonstrate that PEDV N protein can induce cell cycle prolongation at the S-phase, ER stress and up-regulation interleukin-8 expression. These findings provide novel information on the function of the PEDV N protein and are likely to be very useful in understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for PEDV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2013-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Xingang; Zhang, Honglei; Zhang, Qi; Huang, Yong; Dong, Jie; Liang, Yabing; Liu, Hung-Jen; Tong, Dewen","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/008d047db717ab57103f347beaba0388d17446a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117426.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23562137/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113513000862; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113513000862; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.01.034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV N","IEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of PEDV N protein","express PEDV N protein","PEDV target cell","PEDV pathogenesis","cell growth","S-phase cell cycle","porcine intestinal epithelial cell","cell cycle prolongation","expression","ER stress","IEC growth","regulation of IL","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea","cycle progression","regulation interleukin","higher levels of IL","increase of cyclin","decrease of cyclin","molecular mechanisms responsible","line","effects","contagious enteric disease of swine","transcription level","NF-\u03BAB","subcellular localization","endoplasmic reticulum","novel information","findings","Bcl","results","studies","report","control cells","degradation","study","survival"],"language":"en"},

Human and animal clinicians also need to take a more proactive and preventive approach to zoonotic diseases that includes the occupational health of animal workers in farms, laboratories, veterinary clinics, and other settings, as well as the recognition of increased risk among immunocompromised individuals in contact with animals. This requires training in One Health clinical competencies including the ability to diagnose and treat zoonotic diseases, implement preventive care interventions for individual patients, provide occupational health services for animal workers, recognize sentinel cases, report cases to public heath and clinical colleagues, and assess and help to intervene with environmental factors driving infectious disease risk in humans and animals.

Several demographic, environmental, and health care trends, as reviewed in this report, are combining to make it likely that the threat of ID will increase in coming years. Two factors are largely responsible for this trend: first, the constantly changing nature and range of pathogens to which we are exposed and, secondly, the demographic changes occurring in the community, which affect our resistance to infection. This report reviews the evidence base related to the impact of hand hygiene in reducing transmission of ID in the home and community. The report focuses on developed countries, most particularly North America and Europe. It also evaluates the use of alcohol-based hygiene procedures as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, handwashing. The report compiles data from intervention studies and considers it alongside risk modeling approaches (both qualitative and quantitative) based on microbiologic data. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Hand hygiene is a key component of good hygiene practice in the home and community and can produce significant benefits in terms of reducing the incidence of infection, most particularly gastrointestinal infections but also respiratory tract and skin infections. (2) Decontamination of hands can be carried out either by handwashing with soap or by use of waterless hand sanitizers, which reduce contamination on hands by removal or by killing the organisms in situ. The health impact of hand hygiene within a given community can be increased by using products and procedures, either alone or in sequence, that maximize the log reduction of both bacteria and viruses on hands. (3) The impact of hand hygiene in reducing ID risks could be increased by convincing people to apply hand hygiene procedures correctly (eg, wash their hands correctly) and at the correct time. (4) To optimize health benefits, promotion of hand hygiene should be accompanied by hygiene education and should also involve promotion of other aspects of hygiene.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bloomfield, Sally F.; Aiello, Allison E.; Cookson, Barry; O\u0027Boyle, Carol; Larson, Elaine L.","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36c812f4ba52e1f796ac059d2e9d409f2087f557.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115270.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655307005950; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655307005950","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ID"],"locations":["North America","Europe"],"keyphrases":["hand hygiene procedures","promotion of hand hygiene","health impact of hand hygiene","hygiene education","aspects of hygiene","based hygiene procedures","home","given community","key component of good hygiene practice","use of waterless hand sanitizers","ID risks","transmission of ID","threat of ID","health benefits","Decontamination of hands","report compiles data","significant benefits","handwashing","health care trends","gastrointestinal infections","use of alcohol","skin infections","significant concern","microbiologic data","incidence of infection","demographic changes","intervention studies","convincing people","respiratory tract","evidence base related","risk modeling approaches","North America","log reduction","bacteria","viruses","developed countries","terms","soap","alternative","sequence","removal","coming years","factors","nature","range of pathogens","organisms","Europe","conjunction","Infectious diseases","resistance","products","correct time","main conclusions","situ"],"language":"en"},

This broad range of anti-infective activities is due to one common mode of action, i.e., the inhibition of type II topoisomerases or inhibition of viral helicases, thus maintaining the selective toxicity of fluoroquinolones inhibiting microbial topoisomerases at low concentrations but mammalian topoisomerases at much higher concentrations.

Experiments have been carried out using PBMCs of 10 different healthy donors. The results showed that the antiviral activity of IFN contained in the supernatant of SARS-CoV-infected PBMCs was lower than those induced by VSV and NDV. Consequently, SARS-CoV induces a lower synthesis of IFN-\u03B1, -\u03B2 and -\u03B3 compared to VSV and NDV. Characterization of the profile of IFN-\u03B1 subtypes genes expression in SARS-CoV-infected PBMCs demonstrated that the level of IFN-\u03B12 and \u22126 subtypes were higher compared to other IFN-\u03B1 subtypes namely, IFN-\u03B15, \u22128, \u221210, \u221213/1, \u221217, and \u221221. In conclusion, SARS-CoV induces IFNs to a less extent compared to VSV and NDV, thus suggesting that the IFN system does play a limited role in early host defense against SARS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2008-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scagnolari, Carolina; Trombetti, Simona; Cicetti, Simona; Antonelli, Silvia; Selvaggi, Carla; Perrone, Lorena; Visca, Michela; Romano, Sara; Antonelli, Guido","journal":"Intervirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80666187f4b82be397069172e023478d24a8d9b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179525.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18781076/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000154258","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","IFN","VSV","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1 subtypes","profile of IFN","level of IFN","IFN system","well-established IFN","IFN-\u03B15","SARS-CoV infection","CoV-infected PBMCs","lower synthesis of IFN","VSV","NDV","antiviral activity of IFN","supernatant of SARS","\u03B1 subtypes genes expression","Newcastle viruses","changes of interferon","infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells","severe acute respiratory syndrome","early host defense","limited role","coronavirus","vesicular stomatitis","production","IFNs","extent","present study","different healthy donors","\u03B12","conclusion","aim","results","Characterization","Experiments"],"language":"en"},

A 5\u2010year prospective study about active surveillance for outpatients and inpatients with ARIs was conducted in Gansu province, China, from January 2011 to November 2015. Respiratory specimens were collected from patients and tested for eight respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR). In this study, 2768 eligible patients with median age of 43 years were enrolled including pneumonia (1368, 49.2%), bronchitis (435, 15.7%), upper respiratory tract infection or URTI (250, 9.0%), and unclassified ARI (715, 25.8%). Overall, 29.2% (808/2768) were positive for any one of eight viruses, of whom 130 cases were identified with two or more viruses. Human rhinovirus (HRV) showed the highest detection rate (8.6%), followed by influenza virus (Flu, 7.3%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 6.1%), human coronavirus (hCoV, 4.3%), human parainfluenza (PIV, 4.0%), adenovirus (ADV, 2.1%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 1.6%), and human bocavirus (hBoV, 0.7%). Compared with URTI, RSV was more likely identified in pneumonia (\u03C7(2) = 12.720, P \u003C 0.001) and hCoV was more commonly associated with bronchitis than pneumonia (\u03C7(2) = 15.019, P \u003C 0.001). In patients aged less than 5 years, RSV showed the highest detection rate and hCoV was the most frequent virus detected in adults and elderly. The clear epidemical seasons were observed in HRV, Flu, and hCoV infections.

Live attenuated viruses are widely used in both the broiler and layer industry because of their efficacy and ability to be mass applied. Recently, we established a novel reverse genetics system based on targeted RNA recombination to manipulate the genome of IBV strain H52. Here we explore the possibilities to attenuate IBV in a rational way in order to generate safe and effective vaccines against virulent IBV (van Beurden et al., 2017). To this end, we deleted the nonessential group-specific accessory genes 3 and/or 5 in the IBV genome by targeted RNA recombination and selected the recombinant viruses in embryonated eggs. The resulting recombinant (r) rIBV-\u03943ab, rIBV-\u03945ab, and rIBV-\u03943ab5ab could be rescued and grew to the same virus titer as recombinant and wild type IBV strain H52. Thus, genes 3ab and 5ab are not essential for replication in ovo. When administered to one-day-old chickens, rIBV-\u03943ab, rIBV-\u03945ab, and rIBV-\u03943ab5ab showed reduced ciliostasis as compared to rIBV H52 and wild type H52, indicating that the accessory genes contribute to the pathogenicity of IBV. After homologous challenge with the virulent IBV strain M41, all vaccinated chickens were protected against disease based on reduced loss of ciliary movement in the trachea compared to the non-vaccinated but challenged controls. Taken together, deletion of accessory genes 3ab and/or 5ab in IBV resulted in mutant viruses with an attenuated phenotype and the ability to induce protection in chickens. Hence, targeted RNA recombination based on virulent IBV provides opportunities for the development of a next generation of rationally designed live attenuated IBV vaccines.","publish_time":"2018-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"van Beurden, Steven J.; Berends, Alinda J.; Kr\u00E4mer-K\u00FChl, Annika; Spekreijse, Dieuwertje; Chenard, Gilles; Philipp, Hans-Christian; Mundt, Egbert; Rottier, Peter J.M.; Verheije, M.

Among infectious diseases, viral diseases in particular, remain the leading cause of death in humans globally. A variety of phytoconstituents derived from medicinal herbs have been extensively studied for antiviral activity. Based on this rationale, an online search was performed, which helped to identify a large number of plant species harboring antiviral molecules. These herbal sources have been reported individually or in combinations across a large number of citations studied. Activities against rabies virus, Human immunodeficiency virus, Chandipura virus, Japanese Encephalitis Virus, Enterovirus, Influenza A/H1N1 and other influenza viruses were discovered during the literature search. This review includes all such plant species exhibiting antiviral properties. The review also encompasses composition and methodologies of preparing various antiviral formulations around the globe. An elaborate section on the formulations filed for patent registration, along with non-patented formulations, has also been included in this article. To conclude, herbal sources provide researchers enormous scope to explore and bring out viable alternatives against viral diseases, considering non-availability of suitable drug candidates and increasing resistance to existing drug molecules for many emerging and re-emerging viral diseases.

In dogs it is sometimes suggested that the serogroup with the highest MAT titer is the infecting serogroup; however, this is not true in humans with confirmed leptospirosis. We sought to investigate the value of MAT results in predicting the infecting serogroup by comparing results across several laboratories and within individual dogs over time. Objectives: To examine the variability in MAT results across different laboratories in dogs recently vaccinated against leptospirosis, and in dogs with clinical leptospirosis, and to investigate variability over time in MAT results in individual dogs with leptospirosis. Animals: Eighteen dogs from a research colony, 9 of which had been vaccinated against leptospirosis, and 17 dogs clinically diagnosed with leptospirosis. Methods: Serum samples were submitted to up to 5 veterinary diagnostic laboratories for MAT titers from each dog on at least 1 occasion. MAT results also were followed over time in 6 dogs diagnosed with leptospirosis. Results: MAT results were discordant across different laboratories in dogs recently vaccinated against leptospirosis and in dogs with clinical leptospirosis. MAT results varied over time in individual dogs with the disease. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: The MAT is a valuable test for the diagnosis of leptospirosis in dogs, but it is unlikely that test results can be used to predict the infecting serogroup. Laboratories offering the MAT should consider participation in a proficiency scheme.","publish_time":"2011-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Miller, M.D.; Annis, K.M.; Lappin, M.R.; Lunn, K.F.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55e1751ec43c02e05306c5acdc69665a7b7fc867.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166558.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.0704.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21418319/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individual dogs","value of MAT results","clinical leptospirosis","diagnosis of leptospirosis","MAT titers","test results","confirmed leptospirosis","diagnosis of canine leptospirosis","highest MAT titer","time","different laboratories","infecting serogroup","veterinary diagnostic laboratories","variability","valuable test","Clinical Importance","microscopic agglutination test","participation","Background","humans","Conclusions","disease","proficiency scheme","research colony","Methods","Serum samples","Animals","occasion","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

The results showed that canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) was the most commonly detected CIRD pathogen, followed by canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma cynos, Mycoplasma canis and canine pneumovirus (CnPnV). Some classical CIRD agents, such as canine adenoviruses, canine distemper virus and canid herpesvirus 1, were not detected at all, as were not other emerging respiratory viruses (canine influenza virus, canine hepacivirus) and bacteria (Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus). Most severe forms of respiratory disease were observed in the presence of CPIV, CRCoV and M. cynos alone or in combination with other pathogens, whereas single CnPnV or M. canis infections were detected in dogs with no or very mild respiratory signs. Interestingly, only the association of M. cynos (alone or in combination with either CRCoV or M. canis) with severe clinical forms was statistically significant.

Recent studies indicate that cellular entry of this family of viruses requires a series of cellular protein interactions and molecular mechanisms, some of which are unique to filoviruses and others are commonly used by all viral glycoproteins. Details of this entry pathway are highlighted here. Virus entry into cells is initiated by the interaction of the viral glycoprotein(1) subunit (GP(1)) with both adherence factors and one or more receptors on the surface of host cells. On epithelial cells, we recently demonstrated that TIM-1 serves as a receptor for this family of viruses, but the cell surface receptors in other cell types remain unidentified. Upon receptor binding, the virus is internalized into endosomes primarily via macropinocytosis, but perhaps by other mechanisms as well. Within the acidified endosome, the heavily glycosylated GP(1) is cleaved to a smaller form by the low pH-dependent cellular proteases Cathepsin L and B, exposing residues in the receptor binding site (RBS). Details of the molecular events following cathepsin-dependent trimming of GP(1) are currently incomplete; however, the processed GP(1) specifically interacts with endosomal/lysosomal membranes that contain the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) protein and expression of NPC1 is required for productive infection, suggesting that GP/NPC1 interactions may be an important late step in the entry process. Additional events such as further GP(1) processing and/or reducing events may also be required to generate a fusion-ready form of the glycoprotein. Once this has been achieved, sequences in the filovirus GP(2) subunit mediate viral/cellular membrane fusion via mechanisms similar to those previously described for other enveloped viruses. This multi-step entry pathway highlights the complex and highly orchestrated path of internalization and fusion that appears unique for filoviruses.","publish_time":"2012-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hunt, Catherine L.; Lennemann, Nicholas J.; Maury, Wendy","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/793ff384663ce5425d0b61619d47fb0b306d7ec1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3315215.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v4020258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22470835/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cathepsin"],"organizations":["Niemann Pick C1"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular entry","filovirus GP","glycosylated GP","processed GP","family of viruses","Virus entry","cathepsin-dependent trimming of GP","entry process","cellular membrane fusion","NPC1 interactions","enveloped viruses","molecular mechanisms","multi-step entry pathway","molecular events","epithelial cells","surface of host cells","series of cellular protein interactions","expression of NPC1","filovirus family of negative strand RNA viruses","cell surface receptors","subunit","fusion-ready form","mechanisms similar","receptor binding site","viral glycoproteins","Additional events","Details","filoviruses","low pH-dependent cellular proteases Cathepsin","broad range of mammalian cells","cell types","smaller form","important late step","Niemann Pick C1","residues","orchestrated path of internalization","lysosomal membranes","MARV","productive infection","EBOV","Marburgvirus","acidified endosome","RBS","Recent studies","Ebolavirus","endosomes","adherence factors","macropinocytosis","TIM","sequences","processing"],"language":"en"},

However, although highly immunogenic in natural infection, core appears to have low immunogenicity in experimental settings. We aimed to design an HCV vaccine prototype based on core, and devise immunization regimens that would lead to potent anti-core immune responses which circumvent the immunogenicity limitations earlier observed. METHODS: Plasmids encoding core with no translation initiation signal (pCMVcore); with Kozak sequence (pCMVcoreKozak); and with HCV IRES (pCMVcoreIRES) were designed and expressed in a variety of eukaryotic cells. Polyproteins corresponding to HCV 1b amino acids (aa) 1\u201398 and 1\u2013173 were expressed in E. coli. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with four 25-\u03BCg doses of pCMVcoreKozak, or pCMV (I). BALB/c mice were immunized with 100 \u03BCg of either pCMVcore, or pCMVcoreKozak, or pCMVcoreIRES, or empty pCMV (II). Lastly, BALB/c mice were immunized with 20 \u03BCg of core aa 1\u201398 in prime and boost, or with 100 \u03BCg of pCMVcoreKozak in prime and 20 \u03BCg of core aa 1\u201398 in boost (III). Antibody response, [(3)H]-T-incorporation, and cytokine secretion by core/core peptide-stimulated splenocytes were assessed after each immunization. RESULTS: Plasmids differed in core-expression capacity: mouse fibroblasts transfected with pCMVcore, pCMVcoreIRES and pCMVcoreKozak expressed 0.22 \u00B1 0.18, 0.83 \u00B1 0.5, and 13 \u00B1 5 ng core per cell, respectively. Single immunization with highly expressing pCMVcoreKozak induced specific IFN-\u03B3 and IL-2, and weak antibody response. Single immunization with plasmids directing low levels of core expression induced similar levels of cytokines, strong T-cell proliferation (pCMVcoreIRES), and antibodies in titer 10(3)(pCMVcore). Boosting with pCMVcoreKozak induced low antibody response, core-specific T-cell proliferation and IFN-\u03B3 secretion that subsided after the 3rd plasmid injection. The latter also led to a decrease in specific IL-2 secretion. The best was the heterologous pCMVcoreKozak prime/protein boost regimen that generated mixed Th1/Th2-cellular response with core-specific antibodies in titer \u2265 3 \u00D7 10(3). CONCLUSION: Thus, administration of highly expressed HCV core gene, as one large dose or repeated injections of smaller doses, may suppress core-specific immune response. Instead, the latter is induced by a heterologous DNA prime/protein boost regimen that circumvents the negative effects of intracellular core expression.","publish_time":"2009-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alekseeva, Ekaterina; Sominskaya, Irina; Skrastina, Dace; Egorova, Irina; Starodubova, Elizaveta; Kushners, Eriks; Mihailova, Marija; Petrakova, Natalia; Bruvere, Ruta; Kozlovskaya, Tatyana; Isaguliants, Maria; Pumpens, Paul","journal":"Genet Vaccines Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ad61dcfb0a71ebe88c497995cf569eba5e73f8c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2702340.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19505299/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-0556-7-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kozak"],"organizations":["HCV","HCV IRES"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ng core","\u03BCg of core aa","core-specific antibodies","core-specific immune response","core-expression capacity","expressed HCV core gene","\u03BCg of pCMVcoreKozak","low levels of core expression","core-specific T-cell proliferation","Hepatitis C core protein","core peptide-stimulated splenocytes","\u03BCg doses of pCMVcoreKozak","heterologous pCMVcoreKozak prime","negative effects of intracellular core expression","expressing pCMVcoreKozak","potent anti-core immune responses","pCMVcoreIRES","low antibody response","specific IL","HCV IRES","protein boost regimen","specific IFN-\u03B3","Plasmids","HCV vaccine prototype","HCV infected cells","weak antibody response","Single immunization","c mice","low immunogenicity","heterologous DNA prime","IFN-\u03B3 secretion","Th2-cellular response","strong T-cell proliferation","T-incorporation","cytokine secretion","devise immunization regimens","titer","BALB","immunogenicity limitations","similar levels of cytokines","variety of eukaryotic cells","repeated injections of smaller doses","large dose","mixed Th1","attractive target","mouse fibroblasts","translation initiation signal","administration","b amino acids","BACKGROUND","natural infection","Kozak sequence","Polyproteins","experimental settings","decrease","best","METHODS","RESULTS","plasmid injection","CONCLUSION","C57BL","coli"],"language":"en"},

In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued structure-based design of peptidomimetic \u03B1-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases.

We sought to analyze the magnitude of misinformation that is being spread on Twitter (Twitter, Inc., San Francisco, CA) regarding the coronavirus epidemic. Materials and methods We conducted a search on Twitter using 14 different trending hashtags and keywords related to the COVID-19 epidemic. We then summarized and assessed individual tweets for misinformation in comparison to verified and peer-reviewed resources. Descriptive statistics were used to compare terms and hashtags, and to identify individual tweets and account characteristics. Results The study included 673 tweets. Most tweets were posted by informal individuals/groups (66%), and 129 (19.2%) belonged to verified Twitter accounts. The majority of included tweets contained serious content (91.2%); 548 tweets (81.4%) included genuine information pertaining to the COVID-19 epidemic. Around 70% of the tweets tackled medical/public health information, while the others were pertaining to sociopolitical and financial factors. In total, 153 tweets (24.8%) included misinformation, and 107 (17.4%) included unverifiable information regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. The rate of misinformation was higher among informal individual/group accounts (33.8%, p: \u003C0.001). Tweets from unverified Twitter accounts contained more misinformation (31.0% vs 12.6% for verified accounts, p: \u003C0.001). Tweets from healthcare/public health accounts had the lowest rate of unverifiable information (12.3%, p: 0.04). The number of likes and retweets per tweet was not associated with a difference in either false or unverifiable content. The keyword \u201CCOVID-19\u201D had the lowest rate of misinformation and unverifiable information, while the keywords \u201C#2019_ncov\u201D and \u201CCorona\u201D were associated with the highest amount of misinformation and unverifiable content respectively. Conclusions Medical misinformation and unverifiable content pertaining to the global COVID-19 epidemic are being propagated at an alarming rate on social media. We provide an early quantification of the magnitude of misinformation spread and highlight the importance of early interventions in order to curb this phenomenon that endangers public safety at a time when awareness and appropriate preventive actions are paramount.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kouzy, Ramez; Abi Jaoude, Joseph; Kraitem, Afif; El Alam, Molly B; Karam, Basil; Adib, Elio; Zarka, Jabra; Traboulsi, Cindy; Akl, Elie W; Baddour, Khalil","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a049634170464d3150485e864590e0c6897e1ce0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152572.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individual tweets","magnitude of misinformation","lowest rate of misinformation","majority of included tweets","unverifiable content pertaining","Conclusions Medical misinformation","lowest rate of unverifiable information","verified accounts","coronavirus epidemic","unverified Twitter accounts","global COVID","public health accounts","public health information","group accounts","genuine information pertaining","serious content","alarming rate","public safety","social media","keywords","informal individuals","coronavirus disease","early quantification","different trending hashtags","importance of early interventions","awareness","time","appropriate preventive actions","search","comparison","order","phenomenon","San Francisco","difference","healthcare","rapid pace","terms","peer-reviewed resources","beginning","methods","account characteristics","vs","financial factors","number","retweets","Descriptive statistics","Materials","ncov","Background","groups","total","study"],"language":"en"},

While most FCoV-infected cats are healthy or display only a mild enteritis, some go on to develop feline infectious peritonitis, a disease that is especially common in young cats and multi-cat environments. Up to 12% of FCoV-infected cats may succumb to FIP, with stress predisposing to the development of disease. Disease signs The \u2018wet\u2019 or effusive form, characterised by polyserositis (abdominal and/or thoracic effusion) and vasculitis, and the \u2018dry\u2019 or non-effusive form (pyogranulomatous lesions in organs) reflect clinical extremes of a continuum. The clinical picture of FIP is highly variable, depending on the distribution of the vasculitis and pyogranulomatous lesions. Fever refractory to antibiotics, lethargy, anorexia and weight loss are common non-specific signs. Ascites is the most obvious manifestation of the effusive form. Diagnosis The aetiological diagnosis of FIP ante-mortem may be difficult, if not impossible. The background of the cat, its history, the clinical signs, laboratory changes, antibody titres and effusion analysis should all be used to help in decision-making about further diagnostic procedures. At the time of writing, there is no non-invasive confirmatory test available for cats without effusion. Disease management In most cases FIP is fatal. Supportive treatment is aimed at suppressing the inflammatory and detrimental immune response. However, there are no controlled studies to prove any beneficial effect of corticosteroids. Vaccination recommendations At present, only one (intranasal) FIP vaccine is available, which is considered as being non-core. Kittens may profit from vaccination when they have not been exposed to FCoV (eg, in an early-weaning programme), particularly if they enter a FCoV-endemic environment.","publish_time":"2009-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Addie, Diane; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Hosie, Margaret J.; Lloret, Albert; Lutz, Hans; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D.; Thiry, Etienne; Truyen, Uwe; Horzinek, Marian C.","journal":"Journal of Feline Medicine \u0026 Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/397e55ca3a30fa1a2ae28d63ff3efc421ad374fd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X0900120X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481039/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X0900120X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FCoV-infected cats","Disease signs","clinical signs","domestic cats","young cats","clinical picture of FIP","cases FIP","FIP vaccine","non-effusive form","Disease management","development of disease","common non-specific signs","pyogranulomatous lesions","clinical extremes","aetiological diagnosis of FIP ante-mortem","effusion analysis","thoracic effusion","vasculitis","FCoV-endemic environment","non-core","Vaccination recommendations","multi-cat environments","feline infectious peritonitis","Overview Feline coronavirus infection","non-invasive confirmatory test available","anorexia","laboratory changes","weight loss","antibody titres","lethargy","organs","antibiotics","history","distribution","obvious manifestation","polyserositis","stress predisposing","Fever refractory","beneficial effect of corticosteroids","detrimental immune response","controlled studies","present","early-weaning programme","decision-making","diagnostic procedures","mild enteritis","time of writing","Ascites","background","continuum","Supportive treatment","Kittens","conditions"],"language":"en"},

Whether this is causative for the development of NAFLD is not yet clarified. Here we investigate the effect of hepatic DPP4 overexpression on the development of liver steatosis in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. METHODS: Plasma DPP4 activity of subjects with or without NAFLD was analyzed. Wild-type (WT) and liver-specific Dpp4 transgenic mice (Dpp4-Liv-Tg) were fed a high-fat diet and characterized for body weight, body composition, hepatic fat content and insulin sensitivity. In vitro experiments on HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes were conducted to validate cell autonomous effects of DPP4 on lipid storage and insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: Subjects suffering from insulin resistance and NAFLD show an increased plasma DPP4 activity when compared to healthy controls. Analysis of Dpp4-Liv-Tg mice revealed elevated systemic DPP4 activity and diminished active GLP-1 levels. They furthermore show increased body weight, fat mass, adipose tissue inflammation, hepatic steatosis, liver damage and hypercholesterolemia. These effects were accompanied by increased expression of PPAR\u03B3 and CD36 as well as severe insulin resistance in the liver. In agreement, treatment of HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes with physiological concentrations of DPP4 resulted in impaired insulin sensitivity independent of lipid content. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give evidence that elevated expression of DPP4 in the liver promotes NAFLD and insulin resistance. This is linked to reduced levels of active GLP-1, but also to auto- and paracrine effects of DPP4 on hepatic insulin signaling.","publish_time":"2017-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baumeier, Christian; Schl\u00FCter, Luisa; Saussenthaler, Sophie; Laeger, Thomas; R\u00F6diger, Maria; Alaze, Stella Amelie; Fritsche, Louise; H\u00E4ring, Hans-Ulrich; Stefan, Norbert; Fritsche, Andreas; Schwenk, Robert Wolfgang; Sch\u00FCrmann, Annette","journal":"Mol Metab","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19b86cf16403e695203854d598ff4bc4dbfcff86.json; document_parses/pdf_json/15b009c611ca19c1c8eac1a7f686e03fe2b4e8ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5641684.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212877817305318; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212877817305318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29031724/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molmet.2017.07.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAFLD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Dpp4-Liv","Analysis of Dpp4","hepatic insulin","elevated expression of DPP4","paracrine effects of DPP4","increased plasma DPP4 activity","effect of hepatic DPP4 overexpression","Plasma DPP4 activity of subjects","physiological concentrations of DPP4","elevated systemic DPP4 activity","liver-specific Dpp4 transgenic mice","cell autonomous effects of DPP4","severe insulin resistance","hepatic steatosis","liver damage","development of NAFLD","hepatic fat content","development of liver steatosis","increased body weight","Increased hepatic expression of dipeptidyl peptidase","impaired insulin sensitivity independent of lipid content","increased expression of PPAR\u03B3","non-alcoholic fatty liver disease","fat mass","primary mouse hepatocytes","primary hepatocytes","Liv-Tg mice","body composition","high-fat diet","RESULTS","reduced levels of active GLP","treatment of HepG2 cells","mouse model of diet","diminished active GLP","lipid storage","adipose tissue inflammation","CD36","WT","evidence","induced obesity","experiments","hypercholesterolemia","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","healthy controls","agreement","Wild-type","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes were collected from scarlet fever patients in central Taiwan and were characterized by emm sequencing and a standardized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method. National weekly report data were collected for investigating epidemiological trends. RESULTS: A total of 23 emm types were identified in 1,218 S. pyogenes isolates. The five most prevalent emm types were emm12 (50.4%), emm4 (23.2%), emm1 (16.4%), emm6 (3.8%) and emm22 (3.0%). PFGE analysis with SmaI suggested that, with a few exceptions, strains with a common emm type belonged to the same clone. There were two large emm12 clones, one with DNA resistant to cleavage by SmaI. Each prevalent emm clone had major PFGE strain(s) and many minor strains. Most of the minor strains emerged in the population and disappeared soon after. Even some major strains remained prevalent for only 2\u20133 years before declining. The large fluctuation of scarlet fever cases between 2000 and 2006 was associated with the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones. In 2003, the dramatic drop in scarlet fever cases in central Taiwan and throughout the whole country was associated with the occurrence of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that occurred between late-February and mid-June in Taiwan. CONCLUSION: The occurrences of scarlet fever in central Taiwan in 2000\u20132006 were primarily caused by five emm types, which accounted for 96.8% of the isolates collected. Most of the S. pyogenes strains (as defined by PFGE genotypes) emerged and lasted for only a few years. The fluctuation in the number of scarlet fever cases during the seven years can be primarily attributed to the shuffling of six prevalent emm clones and to the SARS outbreak in 2003.","publish_time":"2009-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiou, Chien-Shun; Wang, You-Wun; Chen, Pei-Ling; Wang, Wan-Ling; Wu, Ping-Fuai; Wei, Hsiao-Lun","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3785336f334b853b3d269a8301dfc564f5fae74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2697166.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19486515/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-9-115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PFGE","SARS"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["prevalent emm clones","prevalent emm types","occurrences of scarlet fever","emm sequencing","central Taiwan","scarlet fever patients","number of scarlet fever cases","number of scarlet fever occurrences","pyogenes strains","large fluctuation of scarlet fever cases","major strains","minor strains","common emm type","pyogenes isolates","years","PFGE analysis","PFGE genotypes","major PFGE strain","large emm12 clones","Isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes","SARS outbreak","SmaI","shuffling","standardized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis","severe acute respiratory syndrome","DNA resistant","dramatic drop","method","National weekly report data","exceptions","cleavage","total","country","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","epidemiological trends","emm6","emm4","RESULTS","population","emm22"],"language":"en"},

Our previous microarray analysis showed that H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In present study, we deeply investigated the expression patterns of IFITM1 and IFITM1-mediated antiviral response induced by H9N2 virus infection and inactivated viral particle inoculation in HUVECs. Epithelial cells that are considered target cells of the influenza virus were selected as a reference control. METHODS: First, we quantified the expression levels of IFITM1 in HUVECs induced by H9N2 virus infection or viral particle inoculation using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Second, we observed whether hemagglutinin or neuraminidase affected IFITM1 expression in HUVECs. Finally, we investigated the effect of induced-IFITM1 on the antiviral state in HUVECs by siRNA and activation plasmid transfection. RESULTS: Both H9N2 virus infection and viral particle inoculation increased the expression of IFITM1 without elevating the levels of interferon-\u0251/\u03B2 in HUVECs. HA or NA protein binding alone is not sufficient to increase the levels of IFITM1 and interferon-\u0251/\u03B2 in HUVECs. IFITM1 induced by viral particle inoculation significantly decreased the virus titers in culture supernatants of HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that inactivated viral particle inoculation increased the expression of IFITM1 at mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the induction of IFITM1 expression mediated the antiviral state in HUVECs.","publish_time":"2017-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Bo; Zhao, Lihong; Wang, Wei; Wang, Jianfang; Wang, Hongyan; Duan, Huiqin; Zhang, Jianjun; Qiao, Jian","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e8bc0044aba50cc5c208dbab92d35493e05eb74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5670731.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29100522/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0875-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of IFITM1","expression levels of IFITM1","induction of IFITM1 expression","expression patterns of IFITM1","H9N2 virus infection","inactivated viral particle inoculation","expression of interferon","virus titers","influenza virus","culture supernatants of HUVECs","levels of interferon","protein levels","antiviral state","antiviral response","interferon-\u0251","target cells","Epithelial cells","effect of induced","RESULTS","human umbilical vein endothelial cells","inducible transmembrane protein","NA protein binding","quantitative real-time PCR","siRNA","western blot","previous microarray analysis","important role","activation plasmid transfection","neuraminidase","mRNA","HA","hemagglutinin","reference control","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","present study","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Of the 83 children admitted between April 2009 and March 2010 with H1N1 virus infection to a tertiary children\u2019s hospital in a European setting, five children aged between 2 and 10 years had neurological symptoms. Four patients had seizures and encephalopathy at presentation. One patient presented with ataxia; one developed neuropsychiatric manifestations, and two developed movement disorders during the disease course. Early neuroimaging showed evidence of acute necrotising encephalopathy (ANE) in one case and non-specific white matter changes in another. Initial neuroimaging was normal for the other three, but interval MRI showed increased signal in bilateral periventricular distribution in one and significant cerebral volume loss in the other. Clinical outcomes varied: two recovered fully while three had residual seizures and/or significant cognitive deficits.

Neuroimaging suggestive of ANE, basal ganglia involvement and volume loss appears to be associated with worse neurological outcome.","publish_time":"2011-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Surana, Pinki; Tang, Shan; McDougall, Marilyn; Tong, Cheuk Yan William; Menson, Esse; Lim, Ming","journal":"Eur J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d8eca202a330f1bd01c865f8f8b969d763a45db.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086688.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-010-1392-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21234600/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsxOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H1N1 virus infection","Neurological manifestations","outcomes of children","H1N1 influenza virus infection","neurological symptoms","Neuroimaging suggestive of ANE","common neurological presentations","residual seizures","Early neuroimaging","patients","Initial neuroimaging","worse neurological outcome","significant cerebral volume loss","developed neuropsychiatric manifestations","evidence of acute necrotising encephalopathy","hospital admission","case reports","reported cases","Clinical outcomes","tertiary children\u2019s hospital","developed movement disorders","significant cognitive deficits","bilateral periventricular distribution","pandemic","basal ganglia involvement","increased signal","smaller cohorts","European setting","interval MRI","non-specific white matter changes","disease course","American series","ataxia","years","Conclusion","analysis"],"language":"en"},

However, the molecular mechanism behind ADE is still elusive. Coronavirus spike protein mediates viral entry into cells by first binding to a receptor on the host cell surface and then fusing viral and host membranes. In this study, we investigated how a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb), which targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus spike, mediates viral entry using pseudovirus entry and biochemical assays. Our results showed that MAb binds to the virus surface spike, allowing it to undergo conformational changes and become prone to proteolytic activation. Meanwhile, MAb binds to cell surface IgG Fc receptor, guiding viral entry through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. Our data suggest that the antibody/Fc-receptor complex functionally mimics viral receptor in mediating viral entry. Moreover, we characterized MAb dosages in viral-receptor-dependent, Fc-receptor-dependent, and both-receptors-dependent viral entry pathways, delineating guidelines on MAb usages in treating viral infections. Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism for antibody-enhanced viral entry and can guide future vaccination and antiviral strategies. IMPORTANCE Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been observed for many viruses. It was shown that antibodies target one serotype of viruses but only subneutralize another, leading to ADE of the latter viruses. Here we identify a novel mechanism for ADE: a neutralizing antibody binds to the surface spike protein of coronaviruses like a viral receptor, triggers a conformational change of the spike, and mediates viral entry into IgG Fc receptor-expressing cells through canonical viral-receptor-dependent pathways. We further evaluated how antibody dosages impacted viral entry into cells expressing viral receptor, Fc receptor, or both receptors. This study reveals complex roles of antibodies in viral entry and can guide future vaccine design and antibody-based drug therapy.","publish_time":"2020-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wan, Yushun; Shang, Jian; Sun, Shihui; Tai, Wanbo; Chen, Jing; Geng, Qibin; He, Lei; Chen, Yuehong; Wu, Jianming; Shi, Zhengli; Zhou, Yusen; Du, Lanying; Li, Fang","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ad7c9ac2c3ced6c5cee4267796228ca532da097.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7022351.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02015-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31826992/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["viral receptor","canonical viral-receptor","viral infections","receptors-dependent viral entry pathways","Fc-receptor complex","pseudovirus entry","neutralizing antibody","antibody dosages","receptor-binding domain","cell surface IgG Fc receptor","dependent pathways","ADE","IMPORTANCE Antibody-dependent enhancement","neutralizing monoclonal antibody","antibody-based drug therapy","MAb dosages","virus surface spike","cells","Coronavirus spike protein","surface spike protein of coronaviruses","MAb usages","study","host cell surface","novel mechanism","novel molecular mechanism","serotype of viruses","future vaccine design","complex roles of antibodies","vaccine development","future vaccination","conformational changes","host membranes","Middle East respiratory syndrome","delineating guidelines","RBD","MERS","major concern","epidemiology","biochemical assays","proteolytic activation","antiviral strategies","data","results"],"language":"en"},

To evaluate porcine lung lesions associated with P. multocida, populations of inflammatory cells were examined by immunohistochemistry in necrotic lung lesions from nine pigs and exudative lung lesions from eleven pigs. Lungs from five pigs served as controls. All cases were selected from naturally infected pigs using co-infection based criteria to make them as comparable as possible. The inflammatory cells demonstrated by immunohistochemistry were T-lymphocytes (CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B subsets), B-lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and IgA\u002B, IgM\u002B and IgG\u002B cells. The results showed that (1) a significant increase in all inflammatory cells was found in lesions associated with P. multocida, (2) necrotic lesions had a larger number of CD3\u002B T-lymphocytes and IgA\u002B cells, and (3) cases with exudative lesions had a more CD8\u002B T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, macrophages and neutrophils.

More recent research has revealed that the consequences of lectin-dependent HIV interactions with dendritic cells are diverse and can include uptake for major histocompatibility complex presentation, productive infection, and transfer of virus to T-cells. This chapter introduces DC-SIGN and other cellular lectins known to recognize HIV, and discusses how lectin binding might impact viral dissemination.

Results Nasopharyngeal aspirates and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were tested for respiratory viruses using both the MMA and immunofluorescence. A virus was detected in 47 (47%) patients using the MMA and 8 (8%) patients using immunofluorescence (P = 0.006). MMA-positive and MMA-negative patients had similar clinical and radiographic presentations and were not significantly different for the use of ventilatory support (58% vs. 76%, P = 0.09), occurrence of shock (43% vs. 53%, P = 0.41), use of renal replacement therapy (26% vs. 23%, P = 0.92), SAPS II (35 [26\u201344] vs. 38 [27\u201350], P = 0.36), time spent in the ICU (6 vs. 7 days, P = 0.35), or ICU mortality (17% vs. 28%, P = 0.27). Using MMA, a virus was found in 6 of the 12 patients with no diagnosis at the end of the etiologic investigations. Conclusions In critically ill immunocompromised patients, an MMA was far more sensitive than immunofluorescence for respiratory virus detection. Patients with RVs detected in the respiratory tract had the same clinical characteristics and outcomes as other patients.","publish_time":"2012-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schnell, David; Legoff, J\u00E9r\u00F4me; Mariotte, Eric; Seguin, Am\u00E9lie; Canet, Emmanuel; Lemiale, Virginie; Darmon, Michael; Schlemmer, Beno\u00EEt; Simon, Fran\u00E7ois; Azoulay, \u00C9lie","journal":"Respiratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d2e83e8e3bc27a0f3fd437ba8ad049aaeee3d99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126300.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611112001813; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2012.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22647492/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611112001813","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARF","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MMA-negative patients","ill immunocompromised patients","MMA-positive","respiratory viruses","respiratory tract","respiratory virus detection","immunofluorescence","ARF","acute respiratory failure","clinical characteristics","clinical relevance of molecular testing","solid malignancies","hematologic malignancies","ICU mortality","multiplex molecular assay","use of ventilatory support","sensitivity","hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients","Summary Purpose Prospective single-center study","radiographic presentations","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","iatrogenic immunosuppression","end","Methods","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","diagnosis","outcomes","RVs","Conclusions","etiologic investigations","usual battery of tests","renal replacement therapy","time","days","occurrence of shock","SAPS"],"language":"en"},

The C-terminal conserved region VI (CRVI) of L protein contains a K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad typical for 2\u2019O methyltransferases (MTase). In mononegaviruses, cap-MTase activities have been involved in the 2\u2019O methylation and N7 methylation of the RNA cap structure. These activities play a critical role in the viral life cycle as N7 methylation ensures efficient viral mRNA translation and 2\u2019O methylation hampers the detection of viral RNA by the host innate immunity. The functional characterization of the MTase\u002BCTD domain of Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) revealed cap-independent methyltransferase activities targeting internal adenosine residues. Besides this, the MTase\u002BCTD also methylates, the N7 position of the cap guanosine and the 2\u2019O position of the n1 guanosine provided that the RNA is sufficiently long. Altogether, these results suggest that the filovirus MTases evolved towards a dual activity with distinct substrate specificities. Whereas it has been well established that cap-dependent methylations promote protein translation and help to mimic host RNA, the characterization of an original cap-independent methylation opens new research opportunities to elucidate the role of RNA internal methylations in the viral replication.","publish_time":"2018-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Baptiste; Coutard, Bruno; Guez, Th\u00E9o; Paesen, Guido C; Canard, Bruno; Debart, Fran\u00E7oise; Vasseur, Jean-Jacques; Grimes, Jonathan M; Decroly, Etienne","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abb4c06114edb9aa57132be9201478ac965a56ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6125687.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30192980/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky637","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","CTD"],"locations":["Sudan"],"keyphrases":["cap-MTase activities","O methylation","RNA cap structure","N7 methylation","cap guanosine","host RNA","detection of viral RNA","original cap-independent methylation","RNA capping","cap-independent methyltransferase activities","viral replication","role of RNA internal methylations","cap-dependent methylations","O position","catalytic activities","N7 position","O methyltransferases","protein translation","viral life cycle","efficient viral mRNA translation","Mononegaviruses","critical role","n1 guanosine","functional characterization","internal adenosine residues","host innate immunity","CTD domain of Sudan ebolavirus","E catalytic tetrad typical","SUDV","new research opportunities","dual activity","transcription","filovirus MTases","distinct substrate specificities","CRVI","C-terminal conserved region","Ebola virus","results"],"language":"en"},

Intestinal microbial disorders induce enteric inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, thereby causing adverse effects on the growth and health of pigs. In the human medicine, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which engrafts the fecal microbiota from a healthy donor into a patient recipient, has shown efficacy in intestinal microbiota restoration. In addition, it has been used widely in therapy for human gastrointestinal diseases, including Clostridium difficile infection, inflammatory bowel diseases, and irritable bowel syndrome. Given that pigs share many similarities with humans, in terms of anatomy, nutritional physiology, and intestinal microbial compositions, FMT may also be used to restore the normal intestinal microbiota of pigs. However, feasible procedures for performing FMT in pigs remains unclear. Here, we summarize a standardized preparation for FMT in pigs by combining the standard methodology for human FMT with pig production. The key issues include the donor selection, fecal material preparation, fecal material transfer, stool bank establishment, and the safety for porcine FMT. Optimal donors should be selected to ensure the efficacy of porcine FMT and reduce the risks of transmitting infectious diseases to recipients during FMT. Preparing for fresh fecal material is highly recommended. Alternatively, frozen fecal suspension can also be prepared as an optimal choice because it is convenient and has similar efficacy. Oral administration of fecal suspension could be an optimal method for porcine fecal material transfer. Furthermore, the dilution ratio of fecal materials and the frequency of fecal material transfer could be adjusted according to practical situations in the pig industry. To meet the potential large-scale requirement in the pig industry, it is important to establish a stool bank to make porcine FMT readily available.

FINDINGS: Thirteen novel insect-specific virus isolates were obtained from mosquitoes collected in Indonesia, Thailand and the USA. By electron microscopy, the virions appeared as spherical particles with a diameter of ~50 nm. Their 20,129 nt to 20,777 nt genomes consist of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA with a poly-A tail. Four isolates from Houston, Texas, and one isolate from Java, Indonesia, were identified as variants of the species Alphamesonivirus-1 which also includes Nam Dinh virus (NDiV) from Vietnam and Cavally virus (CavV) from C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire. The eight other isolates were identified as variants of three new mesoniviruses, based on genome organization and pairwise evolutionary distances: Karang Sari virus (KSaV) from Java, Bontag Baru virus (BBaV) from Java and Kalimantan, and Kamphaeng Phet virus (KPhV) from Thailand. In comparison with NDiV, the three new mesoniviruses each contained a long insertion (180 \u2013 588 nt) of unknown function in the 5\u2019 region of ORF1a, which accounted for much of the difference in genome size. The insertions contained various short imperfect repeats and may have arisen by recombination or sequence duplication. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, based on their genome organizations and phylogenetic relationships, thirteen new viruses were identified as members of the family Mesoniviridae, order Nidovirales. Species demarcation criteria employed previously for mesoniviruses would place five of these isolates in the same species as NDiV and CavV (Alphamesonivirus-1) and the other eight isolates would represent three new mesonivirus species (Alphamesonivirus-5, Alphamesonivirus-6 and Alphamesonivirus-7).

Expression of their genes is promoted through reading of genomic RNA and mRNA transcripts by the ribosome of the infected cell. The 5\u2019-end of these RNAs is supposedly protected by an RNA-cap structure (m7GpppNm) whose most synthesis steps remain elusive. In Eukaryotes, the RNA-cap structure is methylated by RNA methyltransferases (MTases) at the RNA-cap N7-guanine position as well as the 2\u2019-O methyl position of the first transcribed nucleotide. In Coronaviridae, two separate enzymes (nsp14 and nsp16) perform the N7-guanine and the 2\u2019-OH methylation, respectively. One salient feature of the Nidovirales N7-guanine MTase nsp14 is that it is the only example of non-Rossman fold viral MTase known so far. Conversely, all other Nidovirales nsp16-like MTases have a canonical Rossman fold. Many Nidovirales members lack either any RNA MTase signature sequence (e.g., Arteriviridae), or lack a N7-guanine MTase signature sequence (e.g., Tobaniviridae, Euroniviridae, Roniviridae, Medioniviridae). Both nsp14-and nsp16-like enzyme genes are usually located in Orf1b encoding for the replication machinery. Here, we report the discovery of a putative Rossman fold RNA MTase in the Orf1a of ten Tobaniviridae members. Multiple sequence alignments and structural analyses identify this novel gene as a typical RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase with substrate specificity and active-site organization similar to the canonical eukaryotic RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase.","publish_time":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferron, Fran\u00E7ois; Debat, Humberto Julio; Decroly, Etienne; Canard, Bruno","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0e2ba405f636e06821999876cd82c00e26404b43.json; document_parses/pdf_json/36ac8b36816dd19f8e9b3925222c82ea268c3384.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/639369","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA methyltransferases","RNA genomes","typical RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase","RNA-cap structure","RNA-cap N7-guanine position","RNA MTase signature sequence","canonical eukaryotic RNA-cap N7-guanine MTase","Nidovirales N7-guanine MTase nsp14","putative Rossman fold RNA MTase","N7-guanine MTase signature sequence","reading of genomic RNA","RNA virus world","Nidovirales nsp16","Nidovirales members lack","example of non-Rossman fold viral MTase","canonical Rossman fold","Nidovirales order","Tobaniviridae members","MTases","Multiple sequence alignments","enzyme genes","O methyl position","substrate specificity","active-site organization similar","structural analyses","novel gene","size","Orf1a","mRNA transcripts","ribosome","m7GpppNm","Orf1b","Euroniviridae","separate enzymes","discovery","Arteriviridae","synthesis steps","transcribed nucleotide","salient feature","Medioniviridae","Coronaviridae","Eukaryotes","infected cell","replication machinery","RNAs","OH methylation","end","Expression"],"language":"en"},

To study the genetic mechanisms and determinants of these processes, we use chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a re-emerging human pathogen transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. We previously isolated a high fidelity (or antimutator) polymerase variant, C483Y, which had decreased fitness in both mammalian and mosquito hosts, suggesting this residue may be a key molecular determinant. To further investigate effects of position 483 on RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) fidelity, we substituted every amino acid at this position. We isolated novel mutators with decreased replication fidelity and higher mutation frequencies, allowing us to examine the fitness of error-prone arbovirus variants. Although CHIKV mutators displayed no major replication defects in mammalian cell culture, they had reduced specific infectivity and were attenuated in vivo. Unexpectedly, mutator phenotypes were suppressed in mosquito cells and the variants exhibited significant defects in RNA synthesis. Consequently, these replication defects resulted in strong selection for reversion during infection of mosquitoes. Since residue 483 is conserved among alphaviruses, we examined the analogous mutations in Sindbis virus (SINV), which also reduced polymerase fidelity and generated replication defects in mosquito cells. However, replication defects were mosquito cell-specific and were not observed in Drosophila S2 cells, allowing us to evaluate the potential attenuation of mutators in insect models where pressure for reversion was absent. Indeed, the SINV mutator variant was attenuated in fruit flies. These findings confirm that residue 483 is a determinant regulating alphavirus polymerase fidelity and demonstrate proof of principle that arboviruses can be attenuated in mammalian and insect hosts by reducing fidelity.","publish_time":"2014-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rozen-Gagnon, Kathryn; Stapleford, Kenneth A.; Mongelli, Vanesa; Blanc, Herv\u00E9; Failloux, Anna-Bella; Saleh, Maria-Carla; Vignuzzi, Marco","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16c14c63746634d9cc1a2d4257b7d7560af187ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3894214.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24453971/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003877","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Drosophila"],"keyphrases":["decreased replication fidelity","major replication defects","generated replication defects","mosquito cells","mosquito hosts","alphavirus polymerase fidelity","genome replication","high fidelity","significant defects","polymerase variant","mosquito cell-specific","Aedes mosquito","residue","RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase","CHIKV mutators","insect hosts","RNA synthesis","mammalian cell culture","reversion","novel mutators","SINV mutator variant","disparate hosts","potential attenuation of mutators","Drosophila S2 cells","insect models","genetic integrity","Sindbis virus","fitness of error","chikungunya virus","genetic mechanisms","specific infectivity","mutator phenotypes","Arboviruses cycle","effects of position","prone arbovirus variants","key molecular determinant","strong selection","higher mutation frequencies","processes","analogous mutations","re-emerging human pathogen","pressure","antimutator","proof of principle","C483Y","RdRp","infection of mosquitoes","fruit flies","invertebrates","determinants","alphaviruses","amino acid","findings"],"language":"en"},

Compared with HIV-negative MSM, HIV-infected individuals had significantly increased multiple plasma cytokines, including GM-CSF, IFN-\u03B12, IL-12p70, IP-10 and VEGF, during both acute and chronic stages of infection.

Methods Two cross-sectional surveys of Australians pilgrims aged \u226518 years were undertaken, one before and one after the Hajj 2014. Results Of 356 pilgrims who completed the survey (response rate 94%), 80% had the influenza vaccine, 30% the pneumococcal vaccine, and 30% the pertussis vaccine. Concern about contracting disease at Hajj was the most cited reason for vaccination (73.4%), and not being aware of vaccine availability was the main reason for non-receipt (56%). Those who obtained pre-travel advice were twice as likely to be vaccinated as those who did not seek advice. Of 150 pilgrims surveyed upon return, 94% reported practicing hand hygiene during Hajj, citing ease of use (67%) and belief in its effectiveness (62.4%) as the main reasons for compliance; university education was a significant predictor of hand hygiene adherence. Fifty-three percent used facemasks, with breathing discomfort (76%) and a feeling of suffocation (40%) being the main obstacles to compliance.

Two XBP-1 isoforms, XBP-1U and XBP-1S, which share an identical N-terminal domain, are present in cells. XBP-1S is a transcription activator while XBP-1U is the inactive isoform.

Here we report the interaction between p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and XBP-1S through the C-terminal domain of XBP-1S. No binding between XBP-1U and PCAF is detected. In a cell-based reporter assay, overexpression of PCAF further stimulates the XBP-1S-mediated cellular and HTLV-1 transcription while knockdown of PCAF exhibits the opposite effect. Expression of endogenous XBP-1S cellular target genes, such as BiP and CHOP, is significantly inhibited when PCAF is knocked down. Furthermore, PCAF is recruited to the promoters of XBP-1S target genes in vivo, in a XBP-1S-dependent manner.

Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) enzyme is the receptor that allows SARS COV2 entry into cells, the fear was that pre-existing treatment with ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection. The present article discusses these concerns. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects. ACEis do not inhibit ACE2. Although ARBs have been shown to upregulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies. Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies. Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alexandre, J; Cracowski, JL; Richard, V; Bouhanick, B","journal":"Ann Endocrinol (Paris)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89c2e0911a11d233d249ee1e54d59b2981f510cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172808.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ando.2020.04.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003426620300627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370986/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003426620300627?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARB","SARS","COVID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2 tissue expression","ACE2 membrane expression","ARB administration","administration of ARB","case of COVID","infusion of soluble ACE2","inactivation of angiotensin","infection","concerns","SARS COV2 entry","tissue activity","multiplication of COVID","human studies","membrane-bound enzyme","SARS COV2 cell entry","fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome cases","inflammatory tissue damage","case adjustment","available evidence","receptor blockers","protective properties","fear","experimental animals","cells","type","risk","pre-existing treatment","carboxypeptidase","hemodynamic situation","ACE1","inhibitors","hypothesis","medical societies","present article","Abstract","date","summary","effects","ACEis","ARBs"],"language":"en"},

Methods All of the dengue case data were obtained from the surveillance system of the Taiwan Center for Disease Control and were analyzed by Pearson correlations, linear regression, and geographical information system (GIS)-based mapping. The impact of implementing airport fever screening was evaluated using the Student\u0027s t-test and two-way analysis of variance. Results A total of 10 351 dengue cases, including 7.1% of imported cases were investigated between 1998 and 2007. The majority of indigenous dengue cases (98.5%) were significantly clustered in southern Taiwan; 62.9% occurred in the metropolitan areas. The seasonality of dengue cases showed a peak from September to November. Airport fever screening was successful in identifying 45% (244/542 ; 95% confidence interval 33.1\u201357.8%) of imported dengue cases with fever. However, no statistical difference was found regarding the impact on community transmission when comparing the presence and absence of airport fever screening. Conclusions Our results show that airport fever screening had a positive effect on partially blocking the local transmission of imported dengue cases, while those undetected cases due to latent or asymptomatic infection would be the source of new dengue outbreaks each year.","publish_time":"2010-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuan, Mei-Mei; Lin, Ting; Chuang, Jen-Hsiang; Wu, Ho-Sheng","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc085c658ab6d08343a62b93b26805de5f9478c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110484.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20656647/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971210023416; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971210023416; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2009.12.010","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["seasonality of dengue cases","dengue infection","local transmission of imported dengue cases","impact of imported cases","majority of indigenous dengue cases","undetected cases","absence of airport fever screening","dengue case data","source of new dengue","dengue non-endemic island","community transmission","Taiwan Center","southern Taiwan","results","surveillance system","asymptomatic infection","geographical information system","linear regression","presence","Student\u0027s t-test","positive effect","Pearson correlations","GIS","Disease Control","two-way analysis of variance","epidemiological trends","study","based mapping","Methods","year","peak","Conclusions","Summary Objective","statistical difference","total","metropolitan areas","confidence interval"],"language":"en"},

Lymphopenia was prominent amongst the laboratory abnormalities reported in acute SARS. Methods The effect of SARS on peripheral blood lymphocytes and their subsets was examined in 271 SARS coronavirus-infected individuals. Results There was a significant decrease in the CD45\u002B, CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B, CD19\u002B and CD16\u002B/56\u002B cell counts over the five weeks of the SARS illness although CD4\u002B/CD8\u002B ratios did not change significantly. The lymphopenia was prolonged, reaching a nadir during days 7\u20139 in the second week of illness before returning towards normal after five weeks, with the lowest mean CD4\u002B cell count of 317 cells\u00D7106/L at day 7, and CD8\u002B cell count of 239 cells\u00D7106/L at day 8. Patients with more severe clinical illness, or patients who died, had significantly more profound CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B lymphopenia. Discussion Lymphopenia is a prominent part of SARS-CoV infection and lymphocyte counts may be useful in predicting the severity and clinical outcomes. Possible reasons for the SARS-associated lymphopenia may be direct infection of lymphocytes by SARS-CoV, lymphocyte sequestration in the lung or cytokine-mediated lymphocyte trafficking. There may also be immune-mediated lymphocyte destruction, bone marrow or thymus suppression, or apoptosis.","publish_time":"2005-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Zhongping; Zhao, Chunhui; Dong, Qingming; Zhuang, Hui; Song, Shujing; Peng, Guoai; Dwyer, Dominic E.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/889f49db646cf0f46662822cfc14dde90cec6168.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110876.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197120500072X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197120500072X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lymphopenia"],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS illness","acute SARS","SARS-associated lymphopenia","effect of SARS","SARS-CoV infection","CD8","lymphocyte counts","Discussion Lymphopenia","SARS coronavirus-infected individuals","lymphocyte sequestration","profound CD4","cell count","severe clinical illness","immune-mediated lymphocyte destruction","cytokine-mediated lymphocyte trafficking","lowest mean CD4","weeks","cells","week of illness","Patients","direct infection of lymphocytes","clinical outcomes","Summary Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome","peripheral blood lymphocytes","bone marrow","lung","thymus suppression","subsets","laboratory abnormalities","large outbreaks of atypical pneumonia","Beijing","largest localized outbreak","CD45","CD3","significant decrease","Possible reasons","China","apoptosis","severity","nadir","Methods","CD16","CD19","Results","days","ratios"],"language":"en"},

One possible way to treat patients, when no other treatment is yet developed, is passive immunization performed by transfusing blood, plasma or plasma immunoglobulin fractions obtained from convalescent donors who have recovered from the disease and have developed protective antibodies. The most recent on-going epidemic is caused by the Ebola virus, a filovirus responsible for Ebola virus disease, a severe, often lethal, hemorrhagic fever. Recently, the use of convalescent blood products was proposed by the WHO as one early option for treating patients with Ebola virus disease. This publication provides an overview of the various convalescent blood products and technological options that could theoretically be considered when there is a need to rely on this therapeutic approach. In countries without access to advanced blood-processing technologies, the choice may initially be restricted to convalescent whole blood or plasma. In technologically advanced countries, additional options for convalescent blood products are available, including virally inactivated plasma and fractionated immunoglobulins. The preparation of minipool immunoglobulins is also a realistic option to consider.","publish_time":"2014-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burnouf, Thierry; Seghatchian, Jerard","journal":"Transfusion and Apheresis Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de04940aa8f6f7c9b6f0b7783da5ae2c425b3315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106377.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050214001724; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050214001724","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["various convalescent blood products","use of convalescent blood products","transfusing blood","Ebola virus disease","convalescent donors","advanced blood-processing technologies","inactivated plasma","plasma immunoglobulin fractions","advanced countries","patients","additional options","technological options","fractionated immunoglobulins","realistic option","early option","preparation of minipool immunoglobulins","filovirus responsible","access","overview","passive immunization","choice","potential","emerging infections","hemorrhagic fever","recent on-going epidemic","need","therapeutic approach","world","publication","possible way","treatment","protective antibodies","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

To study the function of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, we have conducted a yeast two-hybrid screening experiment to identify cellular proteins that may interact with the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. Pyruvate kinase (liver) was found to interact with SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein in this experiment. The binding domains of these two proteins were also determined using the yeast two-hybrid system. The physical interaction between the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid and cellular pyruvate kinase (liver) proteins was further confirmed by GST pull-down assay, co-immunoprecipitation assay and confocal microscopy. Cellular pyruvate kinase activity in hepatoma cells was repressed by SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein in either transiently transfected or stably transfected cells. PK deficiency in red blood cells is known to result in human hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. It is reasonable to assume that an inhibition of PKL activity due to interaction with SARS-CoV N protein is likely to cause the death of the hepatocytes, which results in the elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase and liver dysfunction noted in most SARS patients.

Studies on SPB have been hampered by the limited availability of markers for SPB in predelivery clinical samples that can be easily compared with gestational age-matched normal controls. We hypothesize that SPB involves aberrant placental RNA expression, and that such RNA transcripts can be detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples, which can be compared with gestational age-matched controls. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using gene expression microarray to profile essentially all human genes, we observed that 426 probe signals were changed by \u003E2.9-fold in the SPB placentas, compared with the spontaneous term birth (STB) placentas. Among the genes represented by those probes, we observed an over-representation of functions in RNA stabilization, extracellular matrix binding, and acute inflammatory response. Using RT-quantitative PCR, we observed differences in the RNA concentrations of certain genes only between the SPB and STB placentas, but not between the STB and term elective cesarean delivery placentas. Notably, 36 RNA transcripts were observed at placental microarray signals higher than a threshold, which indicated the possibility of their detection in maternal plasma. Among them, the IL1RL1 mRNA was tested in plasma samples taken from 37 women. It was detected in 6 of 10 (60%) plasma samples collected during the presentation of preterm labor (\u226432.9 weeks) in women eventually giving SPB, but was detected in only 1 of 27 (4%) samples collected during matched gestational weeks from women with no preterm labor (Fisher exact test, p = 0.00056). CONCLUSION: We have identified 36 SPB-associated RNA transcripts, which are possibly detectable in maternal plasma. We have illustrated that the IL1RL1 mRNA was more frequently detected in predelivery maternal plasma samples collected from women resulting in SPB than the gestational-age matched controls.","publish_time":"2012-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chim, Stephen S.

Its enzymatic activity is highly regulated by protein factors, and this regulation can impact on the levels of miRNAs and modulate the behavior of a cell. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of regulation, detailed enzymatic and structural characterization of Dicer are needed. However, these types of studies generally require several milligrams of recombinant protein, and efficient preparation of such quantities of pure human Dicer remains a challenge. To prepare large quantities of human Dicer, we have optimized transfection in HEK293-6E cells grown in suspension and streamlined a purification procedure. RESULTS: Transfection conditions were first optimized to achieve expression levels between 10 and 18 mg of recombinant Dicer per liter of culture. A three-step purification protocol was then developed that yields 4\u20139 mg of purified Dicer per liter of culture in a single day. From SEC-MALS/RI analysis and negative stain TEM, we confirmed that the purified protein is monomerically pure ( \u2265 98%) and folds with the characteristic L-shape geometry. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 5 nM was measured for Dicer binding to pre-let-7a-1, in agreement with previous reports. However, when probing the cleavage activity of Dicer for pre-let-7a-1, we measured k(cat) (7.2 \u00B1 0.5 min(\u2212 1)) and K(M) (1.2 \u00B1 0.3 \u03BCM) values that are much higher than previously reported due to experimental conditions that better respect the steady-state assumption. CONCLUSIONS: The expression and purification protocols described here provide high yields of monomerically pure and active human Dicer. Cleavage studies of a pre-let-7 substrate with this purified Dicer reveal higher k(cat) and K(M) values than previously reported and support the current view that conformational changes are associated with substrate binding. Large quantities of highly pure Dicer will be valuable for future biochemical, biophysical and structural investigations of this key protein of the miRNA pathway.

One potential target for SARS-CoV antiviral drug development is the 3C-like protease (3CLpro). This enzyme is an attractive target since it is essential for viral replication, and since there are now a number of high resolution x-ray structures of SARS-CoV 3CLpro available making structure-based drug-design possible. As a result, SARS-CoV 3CLpro has become the focus of numerous drug discovery efforts worldwide, but as a consequence, a variety of different 3CLpro expression constructs and kinetic assays have been independently developed making evaluation and comparison between potential inhibitors problematic. Here, we review the literature focusing on different SARS-CoV 3CLpro expression constructs and assays used to measure enzymatic activity. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence showing that the activity of 3CLpro enzymatic is significantly reduced when non-native sequences or affinity-tags are added to the N- or C-termini of the enzyme, or when the enzyme used in assays is at concentrations below the equilibrium dissociation constant of the 3CLpro dimer. We demonstrate for the first time the utility of a highly sensitive and novel Alexa488-QSY7 FRET-based peptide substrate designed for routine analysis and high-throughput screening, and show that kinetic constants determined from FRET-based assays that are uncorrected for inner-filter effects can lead to artifacts. Finally, we evaluated the effects of common assay components including DTT, NaCl, EDTA and DMSO on enzymatic activity, and we recommend standardized assay conditions and constructs for routine SARS-CoV 3CLpro assays to facilitate direct comparisons between SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors under development worldwide.","publish_time":"2008-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grum-Tokars, Valerie; Ratia, Kiira; Begaye, Adrian; Baker, Susan C.; Mesecar, Andrew D.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ee83287692dd2e39ce626028890e121639abbfc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/de2b71bc5b1434f5bd2021ce60cb9577f1e469b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4036818.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817020700055X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817020700055X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DTT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CLpro assays","routine SARS-CoV","different SARS-CoV","CLpro enzymatic","CLpro inhibitors","CLpro available","CLpro dimer","SARS-CoV antiviral drug development","CLpro expression constructs","kinetic assays","FRET-based assays","enzymatic activity","enzyme","number of high resolution x-ray structures of SARS","development of vaccines","potential target","structure-based drug-design possible","potential inhibitors problematic","routine analysis","antiviral agents","variety of different","effects of common assay components","kinetic constants","attractive target","C-termini","initial outbreaks","novel Alexa488-QSY7 FRET-based peptide substrate","focus of numerous drug discovery efforts","standardized assay conditions","high-throughput screening","inner-filter effects","treatment of future outbreaks","DTT","NaCl","deadly coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome","EDTA","direct comparisons","DMSO","equilibrium dissociation constant","concentrations","evaluation","control","non-native sequences","public health measures","affinity-tags","utility","consequence","literature","result","viral replication","time","artifacts","experimental evidence","protease"],"language":"en"},

This process of removing and replacing DNA lesions is accomplished by the careful coordination of several protein factors during DNA repair. One such factor is the multifunctional enzyme human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), known best for its DNA backbone cleavage activity at AP sites during base excision repair (BER). APE1 preforms AP site incision with surgical precision and skill, by sculpting the DNA to place the cleavage site in an optimal position for nucleophilic attack within its compact protein active site. APE1, however, has demonstrated broad surgical expertise, and applies its DNA cleavage activity to a wide variety of DNA and RNA substrates. Here, we discuss what is known and unknown about APE1 cleavage mechanisms, focusing on structural and mechanistic considerations. Importantly, disruptions in the biological functions associated with APE1 are linked to numerous human maladies, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The continued elucidation of APE1 mechanisms is required for rational drug design towards novel and strategic ways to target its associated repair pathways.","publish_time":"2018-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Whitaker, Amy M.; Freudenthal, Bret D.","journal":"DNA Repair (Amst)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c39e2373f6d8e3fdb9065b7a8ebb0734ad4a6441.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6491353.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568786418301770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30170830/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dnarep.2018.08.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568786418301770","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA repair","DNA cleavage activity","APE1 cleavage mechanisms","DNA lesions","cleavage site","DNA backbone cleavage activity","deleterious DNA lesion","wide variety of DNA","continued elucidation of APE1 mechanisms","AP site incision","associated repair pathways","compact protein active site","base excision repair","AP sites","protein factors","surgical precision","numerous human maladies","broad surgical expertise","multifunctional enzyme human apurinic","strategic ways","nucleophilic attack","rational drug design","apyrimidinic endonuclease","optimal position","novel","cancer","careful coordination","skill","BER","RNA substrates","neurodegenerative diseases","biological functions","mechanistic considerations","undamaged counterpart","disruptions","process","genome"],"language":"en"},

However, evidence to this effect has been inconsistent. Furthermore, previous urban studies have indicated the interaction between urban morphology and indoor environment. This study thus goes beyond indoor environment to investigate: i) the effects of neighborhood environment on occupant health; and ii) the mediating roles of indoor environment on the neighborhood environment and occupant health relationships. To achieve this aim, buildings located in different neighborhood environment in Hong Kong are selected. Data are collected by post-occupancy evaluation (occupant health), indoor environment assessment (thermal comfort, indoor air quality, ventilation, visual comfort, and acoustic comfort) and neighborhood environment assessment (neighborhood building density, building height, cleanliness and greenspace) through questionnaire survey. Through correlation analysis, regression modelling and Sobel test, it is found that: i) occupant health is significantly affected by neighborhood building height, building density and cleanliness; ii) the relationships between neighborhood environment and occupant health are significantly mediated by indoor environment, in terms of visual and acoustic comfort; and iii) neighborhood greenspace affects occupant health indirectly through influencing indoor air quality. To cross validate the results of the survey study, which is conducted using subjective data, objective measurements and analyses are further conducted. The objective study, echoing the survey study results, indicates that buildings with lower neighborhood building density and height, and cleaner neighborhood environment have better visual (higher illuminance level) and acoustic (lower noise level) performances.","publish_time":"2018-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Isabelle Y.S.; Liu, Anita M.M.","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/705a5b21ea9ee8f30c8132e1476de934ddebb3d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115767.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287986/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132318303718; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132318303718; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.06.028","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsxNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["neighborhood environment assessment","different neighborhood environment","cleaner neighborhood environment","effects of neighborhood environment","indoor environment assessment","built environment","influences of indoor environment quality","neighborhood greenspace","neighborhood building height","mediating roles of indoor environment","occupant health relationships","lower neighborhood building density","indoor air quality","acoustic comfort","visual comfort","public health research","objective study","survey study results","thermal comfort","terms of visual","buildings","cleanliness","questionnaire survey","lower noise level","subjective data","urban morphology","objective measurements","higher illuminance level","previous urban studies","interaction","ventilation","post-occupancy evaluation","regression modelling","correlation analysis","Sobel test","main focuses","analyses","performances","Hong Kong","aim","evidence"],"language":"en"},

In the United States, allergic diseases affect 20 to 40 million people annually, including 10% to 30% of adults and close to 40% of children. An estimated 15 million people in the United States have been diagnosed as having asthma, with this number on the rise. Concomitant asthma affects 67% of patients who have allergic rhinitis. As a result of the increase in ventilation during exercise, athletes in particular experience significant symptoms of allergy triggered by exposure to aeroallergens. The allergic response causes nasal and conjunctival congestion, tearing, breathing difficulties, pruritus, fatigue, and mood changes, which affect athletic performance. Systemic symptoms of anaphylaxis from allergy, although rare, can be life threatening. Several decades ago it was inconceivable that an athlete who had asthma could perform competitively, let alone win Olympic gold medals. Today, with proper diagnosis, education, and optimal therapeutic management, the allergic athlete can achieve great strides in all sports endeavors. To avoid seasonal allergic flares and maximize performance, the physician providing care for an athlete who has seasonal allergies must be aware of the climatic patterns of aeroallergen expression, and adjust exercise and pharmacologic regimens accordingly. This article summarizes the effects of allergic disease on exercise and highlights the challenges that seasonal allergy place on athletic performance. Doping considerations grant additional complexity to this issue and underscore the need for a competent, skillful, informed, and ethical approach to treating seasonal allergy in the competitive athlete.","publish_time":"2005-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Komarow, Hirsh D.; Postolache, Teodor T.","journal":"Clinics in Sports Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9c1aca657471e7f1b7cdeb210ede8482153cd9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119062.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278591904001425; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278591904001425","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyMTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["allergic athlete","Allergic diseases","seasonal allergic flares","allergic response","allergic rhinitis","exercise","seasonal allergy place","effects of allergic disease","seasonal allergies","athletic performance","competitive athlete","United States","Concomitant asthma","people","particular experience significant symptoms of allergy","Systemic symptoms of anaphylaxis","athletes","optimal therapeutic management","challenges","age groups","education","ventilation","conjunctival congestion","mood changes","great strides","climatic patterns of aeroallergen expression","issue","additional complexity","difficulties","pruritus","fatigue","locations","increase","exposure","physician","ethical approach","patients","care","Doping considerations","proper diagnosis","need","sports endeavors","world","article","pharmacologic regimens","Olympic gold medals","life threatening","result","number","aeroallergens","adults","children","rise","decades"],"language":"en"},

Antiviral antibodies (Abs) recognising viral glycoproteins or protein antigen displayed on the surface of virions or virus-infected cells are crucial in rendering the virus noninfectious and in eliminating viruses or infected cells, either acting alone or in conjunction with complement. In many instances, passive transfer of Abs is sufficient to protect from viral infection. Herpesviruses (HV) are equipped with a large array of immunomodulatory functions which increase the efficiency of infection by dampening the antiviral immunity. Members of the \u03B1- and \u03B2-subfamily of the Herpesviridae are distinct in encoding transmembrane glycoproteins which selectively bind IgG via its Fc domain. The Fc-binding proteins constitute viral Fc\u03B3 receptors (vFc\u03B3Rs) which are expressed on the cell surface of infected cells. Moreover, vFc\u03B3Rs are abundantly incorporated into the envelope of virions. Despite their molecular and structural heterogeneity, the vFc\u03B3Rs generally interfere with IgG-mediated effector functions like antibody (Ab)-dependent cellular cytolysis, complement activation and neutralisation of infectivity of virions. vFc\u03B3Rs may thus contribute to the limited therapeutic potency of antiherpesviral IgG in clinical settings.

Few quantitative studies on this topic have been published in domestic and international peer-reviewed journals. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to use national data to quantitatively analyse the scale, structure, and changes of public health education in China\u2019s HEIs, and to compare the changes of public health education with those of other health science disciplines. METHODS: This study uses previously unreleased national data provided by the Ministry of Education of China that includes the number of health professional students by school and major. The data, which spans from 1998 to 2012, are descriptively analyzed. RESULTS: The number of HEIs for public health education per 100 million population increased from 7.2 in 1998 to 11.3 in 2012. The total enrolment, number of students, and number of graduates increased at rates of 7.3, 7.4, and 5.8% per year, respectively. The percentage of junior college students dropped drastically from 24.0 to 8.4% from 1998 to 2012. During that same period, the number of undergraduates, master and doctorate students increased. Undergraduates accounted for the majority of public health graduates (63.1%) in 2012, and master and doctorate students increased by 10.0 and 5.1 times, respectively, from 1998 to 2012. The relative percentage of public health enrollment, students, and graduates to all health education disciplines dropped from about 6.0% percent in 1998 to around 2% in 2012. CONCLUSIONS: The overall scale of public health education has clearly expanded, though at a slower pace than many other health science disciplines in China. The increase of public health graduates helped to address the previous shortage of public health professionals. Gradually adopting a modern model of education, public health education in China has undergone notable changes that may be informative to other developing countries though it still faces a complex situation in terms of graduates\u2019 adherence to public health, student recruitment, teaching and training, program planning and reform.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hou, Jianlin; Wang, Zhifeng; Liu, Xiaoyun; Luo, Youhui; Sabharwal, Sabhyta; Wang, Nan; Meng, Qingyue","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/215e667edcc02054361258755a4db8bca18a4e9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5984438.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29855370/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-5605-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjsyOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["changes of public health education","health education disciplines","overall scale of public health education","majority of public health graduates","increase of public health graduates","number of health professional students","health science disciplines","relative percentage of public health enrollment","previous shortage of public health professionals","Ministry of Education","number of students","China\u2019s modern education","modern model of education","number of graduates","nation\u2019s development of education","higher education institutions","number of HEIs","doctorate students","number of undergraduates","China\u2019s HEIs","percentage of junior college students","notable changes","unreleased national data","master","developing countries","terms of graduates\u2019 adherence","student recruitment","analyses","teaching","training","school","complex situation","lack of authoritative statistics","international peer-reviewed journals","program","study","structure","slower pace","topic","CONCLUSIONS","total enrolment","BACKGROUND","population","quantitative studies","years","reform","METHODS","period","RESULTS","rates","knowledge gap","times"],"language":"en"},

ES-DMA is a rapid particle sizing method capable of characterizing certain aspects of the structure (such as capsid proteins) and obtaining complete size distributions of viruses and virus-like particles. It was shown that ES-DMA can distinguish intact virus particles from degraded particles and measure the concentration of virus particles when calibrated with nanoparticles of known concentration. The technique has a measurement uncertainty of \u224820%, is linear over nearly 3 orders of magnitude, and has a lower limit of detection of \u2248109 particles/mL.

Legionnaires\u0027 disease is one of the non-zoonotic causes of atypical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Legionnaires\u0027 disease commonly presents as severe CAP requiring hospitalization and intensive care. Each atypical CAP has its own characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary laboratory clinical findings and abnormalities that are the basis of clinical syndromic diagnosis. Studies have been unsuccessful in identifying individual clinical and laboratory parameters that are specific for Legionella. Individually, clinical and laboratory abnormalities lack diagnostic specificity. The diagnostic specificity of clinical and laboratory findings is increased when combined and are the basis of a clinical syndromic diagnosis. The importance of serial nonspecific laboratory abnormalities with Legionnaires\u0027 disease is emphasized. The sensitivity and specificity of a clinical syndromic diagnosis are enhanced if they are based on a weighted point score system. A diagnostic weighted point score system is based on the varying diagnostic importance of clinical and laboratory diagnostic findings. The Winthrop-University Hospital\u0027s Infectious Disease Division\u0027s rapid clinical diagnostic weighted point system is based on a weighted point score of clinical and laboratory findings. The case presented is that of a 55-year-old man with severe CAP who required hospitalization and intensive care admission. The presumptive clinical diagnosis of Legionella CAP was based on the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division\u0027s weighted point score system, which permitted early empiric anti-Legionella antimicrobial therapy and prompted specific Legionella testing. Legionnaires\u0027 disease is definitively diagnosed by serology or a urinary Legionella antigen test. This case of severe Legionnaires\u0027 CAP was confirmed by urinary antigen test reported on hospital day 6. The Winthrop-University Hospital is weighted point score system (modified) permits a rapid clinical presumptive diagnosis of Legionnaires\u0027 disease and is an accurate predictor of Legionella CAP.","publish_time":"2008-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunha, Burke A.","journal":"Heart \u0026 Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89a2c02c1ced0c6988340465d9514ec70250906b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112393.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956307002336; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147956307002336; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2007.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18620108/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjszMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAP","Legionella","Legionella CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["weighted point score of clinical","diagnostic specificity of clinical","presumptive clinical diagnosis of Legionella CAP","rapid clinical presumptive diagnosis of Legionnaires\u0027 disease","laboratory diagnostic findings","diagnostic weighted point score system","laboratory findings","basis of clinical syndromic diagnosis","varying diagnostic importance of clinical","characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary laboratory clinical findings","Winthrop-University Hospital\u0027s Infectious Disease Division\u0027s rapid clinical diagnostic weighted point system","severe CAP","case of severe Legionnaires\u0027 CAP","Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division\u0027s weighted point score system","laboratory parameters","atypical CAP","urinary Legionella antigen test","specific Legionella testing","importance of serial nonspecific laboratory abnormalities","accurate predictor of Legionella","hospital day","hospitalization","urinary antigen test","early empiric anti-Legionella antimicrobial therapy","intensive care admission","characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement","non-zoonotic causes of atypical community","serology","lungs","pneumonia","systemic infection","year-old man","sensitivity","Studies"],"language":"en"},

Objectives: This paper describes a PCR-hybridization-immunoenzymatic assay (PCR Adenovirus consensus\u00AE) used to detect Ad and identify Ad species in respiratory specimens. Results: On seven representative serotypes Ad 12, Ad 3, Ad 7, Ad 11, Ad 1, Ad 8, Ad 4, the mean genome equivalents per ml and the mean 50% infectious doses per ml were 106.3and 104, respectively. Using 362 nasal aspirates from children, Ad were detected by immunofluorescence (IF) and culture in 97 cases (27%), by the PCR-Ad hexon method in 107 cases (29.5%) and by the PCR Adenovirus Consensus\u00AE method in 113 cases (31.2%); 13 samples were found positive by both PCR and negative by the IF and culture methods; five samples were only positive according to the PCR Adenovirus Consensus\u00AE method. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value and predictive negative value of the PCR Adenovirus Consensus\u00AE method were 97.9%, 93.2%, 84%, 99.1%, respectively. The method identified the species (sp) from 91 positive amplicons: 1 Ad sp A, 44 Ad sp B, 42 Ad sp C, 3 Ad sp E, and 1 Ad sp F; 85 isolates were identified by IF or the neutralisation in culture, and 86 by a PCR-RE digestion method. The PCR Adenovirus Consensus\u00AE detected six positive samples that were negative according to the IF and culture methods, and it identified the precise species of nine IF-positive and culture-negative nasal aspirates. Conclusion: The PCR Adenovirus Consensus\u00AE technique is more efficient than the classical IF or culture techniques for the detection of Ad in respiratory samples. An internal control is included to validate the screening results, and specific probes are used to identify the Ad species.","publish_time":"2004-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vabret, Astrid; Gouarin, St\u00E9phanie; Joannes, Martine; Barranger, Come; Petitjean, Jo\u00EBlle; Corbet, Sandrine; Brouard, Jacques; Lafay, Fran\u00E7oise; Duhamel, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Guillois, Bernard; Freymuth, Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab292a2d7ae194e60f7bf0408c09fa1fe1529faf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129058.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653204001258; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653204001258","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR Adenovirus","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ad species","detection of Ad","PCR-Ad hexon method","Ad sp E","Ad sp C","Ad sp B","Ad sp F","PCR Adenovirus consensus","representative serotypes Ad","PCR-hybridization","positive samples","culture techniques","culture methods","predictive positive value","positive amplicons","culture-negative nasal aspirates","respiratory samples","digestion method","predictive negative value","cases","precise species","respiratory infections","respiratory specimens","screening results","Antigen detection assays","viral isolation techniques","mean genome equivalents","immunoenzymatic assay","specificity","Abstract Background","polymerase chain reaction","sensitivity","children","specific probes","paper","immunofluorescence","isolates","adenoviruses","Conclusion","infectious doses","Objectives","internal control","neutralisation"],"language":"en"},

The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), causes acute hepatitis in its natural host and provides a useful model for understanding virus interaction with liver cells. The MHV accessory protein, ns2, antagonizes the type I interferon response and promotes hepatitis. We show that ns2 has 2\u2019,5\u2019-phosphodiesterase activity, which blocks the interferon inducible 2\u2019,5\u2019-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway to facilitate hepatitis development. Ns2 cleaves 2\u2019, 5\u2019-oligoadenylate, the product of OAS, to prevent activation of the cellular endoribonuclease RNase L and consequently block viral RNA degradation. An ns2 mutant virus was unable to replicate in the liver or induce hepatitis in wild type mice, but was highly pathogenic in RNase L deficient mice. Thus, RNase L is a critical cellular factor for protection against viral infection of the liver and the resulting hepatitis.","publish_time":"2012-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Ling; Jha, Babal K.; Wu, Ashley; Elliott, Ruth; Ziebuhr, John; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Silverman, Robert H.; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Cell Host \u0026 Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cecc46c7090662185f021aefe5ac236c9b888aeb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0f918906d94d9650e1a7332d05b8b7913d6354fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3377938.xml.json","url":"http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312812001333/pdf; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2012.04.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312812001333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22704621/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312812001333","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV","OAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouse hepatitis virus","acute hepatitis","hepatitis development","resulting hepatitis","ns2 mutant virus","virus interaction","liver cells","cellular endoribonuclease RNase","underlying mechanisms of virus","induced liver pathology","wild type mice","viral infection","product of OAS","interferon inducible","deficient mice","interferon response","oligoadenylate synthetase","critical cellular factor","MHV accessory protein","viral RNA degradation","protection","useful model","natural host","activation","murine coronavirus","need","pathway","humans","phosphodiesterase activity","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Data are limited on the impact of neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) treatment on avian influenza A(H7N9) virus RNA shedding. METHODS. In this multicenter, retrospective study, data were collected from adults hospitalized with A(H7N9) infection during 2013\u20132017 in China. We compared clinical features and A(H7N9) shedding among patients with different NAI doses and combination therapies and evaluated factors associated with A(H7N9) shedding, using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS. Among 478 patients, the median age was 56 years, 71% were male, and 37% died. The median time from illness onset to NAI treatment initiation was 8 days (interquartile range [IQR], 6\u201310 days), and the median duration of A(H7N9) RNA detection from onset was 15.5 days (IQR, 12\u201320 days). A(H7N9) RNA shedding was shorter in survivors than in patients who died (P \u003C .001). Corticosteroid administration (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .50-.77]) and delayed NAI treatment (HR, 0.90 [95% CI, .91-.96]) were independent risk factors for prolonged A(H7N9) shedding. There was no significant difference in A(H7N9) shedding duration between NAI combination treatment and monotherapy (P = .65) or between standard-dose and double-dose oseltamivir treatment (P = .70). CONCLUSIONS. Corticosteroid therapy and delayed NAI treatment were associated with prolonged A(H7N9) RNA shedding. NAI combination therapy and double-dose oseltamivir treatment were not associated with a reduced A(H7N9) shedding duration as compared to standard-dose oseltamivir.","publish_time":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yeming; Guo, Qiang; Yan, Zheng; Zhou, Daming; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Shujun; Li, Yu-Ping; Yuan, Jing; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Shen, Xinghua; Wu, Wenjuan; Zhao, Hui; Wu, Yun-Fu; Shang, Jia; He, Zhengguang; Yang, Yi; Zhao, Hongsheng; Hong, Yongqing; Zhang, Zehua; Wu, Min; Wei, Tiemin; Deng, Xilong; Deng, Yijun; Cai, Li-hua; Lu, Weihua; Shu, Hongmei; Zhang, Lin; Luo, Hong; Zhou, Ying; Weng, Heng; Song, Keyi; Yao, Li; Jiang, Mingguang; Zhao, Boliang; Chi, Ruibin; Guo, Boqi; Fu, Lin; Yu, Long; Min, Haiyan; Chen, Pu; Chen, Shuifang; Hong, Liang; Mao, Wei; Huang, Xiaoping; Gu, Lijun; Li, Hui; Wang, Chen; Cao, Bin","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/772dc0d55dba558c45e2282bb11dc625fe274511.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6679685.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29648602/; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/217/11/1708/24789949/jiy115.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAI"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["H7N9","NAI combination treatment","delayed NAI treatment","NAI treatment initiation","virus RNA shedding","NAI combination therapy","double-dose oseltamivir treatment","days","different NAI doses","standard-dose oseltamivir","median duration","patients","RNA detection","combination therapies","Corticosteroid therapy","HR","median time","IQR","median age","Data","CI","illness onset","evaluated factors","Corticosteroid administration","independent risk factors","avian influenza","monotherapy","Cox proportional hazards regression","interquartile range","impact of neuraminidase inhibitor","hazard ratio","survivors","retrospective study","years","adults","confidence interval","infection","significant difference","clinical features","China","male","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We aim to briefly provide insight into potential mechanistic links between the novel coronavirus infection and diabetes, present practical management recommendations, and elaborate on the differential needs of several patient groups.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bornstein, Stefan R; Rubino, Francesco; Khunti, Kamlesh; Mingrone, Geltrude; Hopkins, David; Birkenfeld, Andreas L; Boehm, Bernhard; Amiel, Stephanie; Holt, Richard IG; Skyler, Jay S; DeVries, J Hans; Renard, Eric; Eckel, Robert H; Zimmet, Paul; Alberti, Kurt George; Vidal, Josep; Geloneze, Bruno; Chan, Juliana C; Ji, Linong; Ludwig, Barbara","journal":"Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5900b3070d20437d4784f3998f118c066c6ac5a3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7180013.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32334646/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213858720301522; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213858720301522; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-8587(20)30152-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["management of diabetes","field of diabetes","coronavirus disease","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","novel coronavirus infection","practical recommendations","COVID","Patients","pandemic","present practical management recommendations","known human pathogenic coronavirus infections","Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome","increased risk of severe complications","potential mechanistic links","multi-organ failure","severity","guidance","endocrinology","international panel of experts","differential needs","patient groups","insight","important comorbidities","importance","global region"],"language":"en"},

This study investigates the wind\u2010induced interunit dispersion around multistory buildings using the large eddy simulation (LES) method. This is the first time interunit dispersion has been investigated transiently using a LES model. The quality of the selected LES model is seriously assured through both experimental validation and sensitivity analyses. Two aspects are paid special attention: (i) comparison of dispersion routes with those provided by previous RANS simulations and (ii) comparison of timescales with those of natural ventilation and the survival times of pathogens. The LES results reveal larger dispersion scopes than the RANS results. Such larger scopes could be caused by the fluctuating and stochastic nature of envelope flows, which, however, is canceled out by the inherent Reynolds\u2010averaged treatment of RANS models. The timescales of interunit dispersion are comparable with those of natural ventilation. They are much shorter than the survival time of most pathogens under ordinary physical environments, indicating that interunit dispersion is a valid route for disease transmission.","publish_time":"2015-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ai, Z.

Chest radiographs and Computed Tomography (CT) are principal radiological modalities to assess the lung abnormalities. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to investigate the chest images characteristic of H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical and imaging data of 11 cases diagnosed as H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza were collected from 4 cities in the southern region of the Yangtze River, China. The chest imaging manifestations were analyzed by the assigned expert group. The analyzed cases include 7 males and 4 females aged from 20 to 84 years, with a mean of 55.6 years. The clinical symptoms were mainly fever (100%, 11/11) and cough (72.7%, 8/11). RESULTS: Segmental or lobar ground-glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation was shown in 8 cases (72.7% or 8/11). Air bronchogram was found in 7 cases (63.6% or 7/11). The lesions developed into multiple or diffuse in both lungs rapidly at the progressive stage. The reticulation shadows were shown after some lesions absorbed at the stable stage. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic imaging demonstrations of H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza are segmental or lobar exudative lesions at lungs at the initial stage, which rapidly progress into bilateral distribution at lungs at the progressive stage.","publish_time":"2015-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xi-ming; Hu, Su; Hu, Chun-hong; Hu, Xiao-yun; Yu, Yi-xing; Wang, Ya-fei; Wang, Jian-liang; Li, Guo-hua; Mao, Xin-feng; Tu, Jian-chun; Chen, Ling; Zhao, Wei-feng","journal":"Radiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16450e62e061687480a63ab5442cbd7c67c6c10d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104112.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352621115000054; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352621115000054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289064/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrid.2015.02.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["the Yangtze River","China"],"keyphrases":["characteristic imaging demonstrations of H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza","chest images characteristic of H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza","lungs","progressive stage","analyzed cases","H7N9 virus","Human infection","initial stage","stable stage","chest imaging manifestations","lobar exudative lesions","imaging data","Chest radiographs","years","clinical symptoms","lobar ground-glass opacity","principal radiological modalities","acute respiratory infectious disease","Computed Tomography","GGO","southern region","severe pneumonia","Yangtze River","study","consolidation","METHODS","cities","bilateral distribution","BACKGROUND","lung abnormalities","high mortality","China","assigned expert group","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS","females","OBJECTIVES","goal","MATERIALS","reticulation shadows","Air bronchogram","mean","cough"],"language":"en"},

Before the SARS outbreak, an average of 1 LTx was performed per month in our center. For 6 months since the outbreak, there had been no LTx performed. The intensive care unit had to be dedicated to patients with SARS. Two of the LTx team members were struck by SARS. A survey conducted among LTx recipients and their family members (n = 45) demonstrated symptoms of anxiety and stress in all. Some LTx recipients were treated at the Emergency Department for suspected SARS, which were later confirmed to be false alarms. Many LTx patients were too frightened to come back for follow-up. A new strain of coronavirus was identified as the causative agent. The origin of this virus is uncertain but the probability of zoonoses is being seriously discussed. Not only are immunosuppressed patients exposed to higher risk of infection, but also the waiting list mortality is also expected to increase.

The most frequent types of cancers in children and adolescents are leukemias, followed by brain and central nervous system tumors and lymphomas. The recovery rate of cancer in children is around 80% in developed countries and up to 30% in developing countries. Some of the main causes of complications in children and adolescents with cancer are respiratory viral infections, mainly in bone marrow-transplanted patients. Respiratory viruses have been detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage or nasal wash specimens from cancer patients with or without respiratory illness symptoms. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is within the ten most common viruses that are encountered in samples from pediatric patients with underlying oncology conditions. In most of cases, HMPV is found as the only viral agent, but co-infection with other viruses or with bacterial agents has also been reported. The discrepancies between the most prevalent viral agents may be due to the different populations studied or the range of viral agents tested. Some of the cases of infection with HMPV in cancer patients have been fatal, especially in those who have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This review seeks to show a general view of the participation of HMPV in respiratory illness as a complication of cancer in childhood and adolescence.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martinez-Rodriguez, Cesar; Banos-Lara, Ma. del Rocio","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a61f3b09aff9e066b7996f5c3937792419a4f935.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168653.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31936721/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9010051","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cancer patients","complication of cancer","Respiratory viruses","children","respiratory viral infections","recovery rate of cancer","range of viral agents","prevalent viral agents","pediatric patients","participation of HMPV","respiratory illness symptoms","adolescents","cases of infection","childhood","bacterial agents","common viruses","bone marrow-transplanted patients","co-infection","developed countries","developing countries","brain","samples","nasal wash specimens","central nervous system tumors","bronchoalveolar lavage","leukemias","underlying oncology conditions","lymphomas","general view","frequent types of cancers","main causes of complications","cause of death","hematopoietic stem cell transplant","disease","different populations","adolescence","discrepancies","review","Human metapneumovirus"],"language":"en"},

However, their clinical development has been hindered by the lack of a robust animal model that recapitulate the morbidity and mortality of human infections. We assessed the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of m336 by using well-characterized transgenic mice shown to be highly sensitive to MERS-CoV infection and disease. We found that mice treated with m336 prior to or post lethal MERS-CoV challenging were fully protected, compared to control mice which sufferered from profound weight loss and uniform death within days after infection.

A pulse particle source was applied at the mouth of an index manikin to simulate a cough. The particle concentrations versus time were measured at the breathing zone of the other manikins.

As part of broader big data and digital humanitarianism discourses, there is an emerging interest in data produced through mobile phone communications for enhancing the data environment in such circumstances. This paper assembles user perspectives and critically examines existing evidence and future potential of mobile phone data derived from call detail records (CDRs) and two-way short message service (SMS) platforms, for managing and responding to humanitarian disasters caused by communicable disease outbreaks. We undertake a scoping review of relevant literature and in-depth interviews with key informants to ascertain the: (i) information that can be gathered from CDRs or SMS data; (ii) phase(s) in the disease disaster management cycle when mobile data may be useful; (iii) value added over conventional approaches to data collection and transfer; (iv) barriers and enablers to use of mobile data in disaster contexts; and (v) the social and ethical challenges. Based on this evidence we develop a typology of mobile phone data sources, types, and end-uses, and a decision-tree for mobile data use, designed to enable effective use of mobile data for disease disaster management. We show that mobile data holds great potential for improving the quality, quantity and timing of selected information required for disaster management, but that testing and evaluation of the benefits, constraints and limitations of mobile data use in a wider range of mobile-user and disaster contexts is needed to fully understand its utility, validity, and limitations.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cinnamon, Jonathan; Jones, Sarah K.; Adger, W.

While the greatest number of cases has occurred in Saudi Arabia, the recent export of MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to Republic of Korea showed that a pandemic is a possibility that cannot be ignored. Due to the deficit of knowledge in transmission methodology, targeted treatment and possible vaccines, understanding this virus should be a priority. Our aim was to combine epidemiological data from literature with genetic information from viruses sequenced around the world to present a phylodynamic picture of MERS spread molecular level to global scale. METHODS: We performed a qualitative meta-analysis of all laboratory confirmed cases worldwide to date based on literature, with emphasis on international transmission and healthcare associated infections. In parallel, we used publicly available MERS-CoV genomes from GenBank to create a phylogeographic tree, detailing geospatial timeline of viral evolution. RESULTS: Several healthcare associated outbreaks starting with the retrospectively identified hospital outbreak in Jordan to the most recent outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia have occurred. MERS has also crossed many oceans, entering multiple nations in eight waves between 2012 and 2015. In this paper, the spatiotemporal history of MERS cases, as documented epidemiologically, was examined by Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Distribution of sequences into geographic clusters and interleaving of MERS-CoV sequences from camels among those isolated from humans indicated that multiple zoonotic introductions occurred in endemic nations. We also report a summary of basic reproduction numbers for MERS-CoV in humans and camels. CONCLUSION: Together, these analyses can help us identify factors associated with viral evolution and spread as well as establish efficacy of infection control measures. The results are especially pertinent to countries without current MERS-CoV endemic, since their unfamiliarity makes them particularly susceptible to uncontrollable spread of a virus that may be imported by travelers.

The 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) is essential for the coronaviral life cycle and is an appealing target for the development of therapeutics. We report the expression, purification, crystallization and 2.10 \u00C5 X-ray structure of 3CL(pro) from PEDV. Analysis of the PEDV 3CL(pro) structure and comparison to other coronaviral 3CL(pro)\u2019s from the same alpha-coronavirus phylogeny shows that the overall structures and active site architectures across 3CL(pro)\u2019s are conserved, with the exception of a loop that comprises the protease S(2) pocket. We found a known inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CL(pro), (R)-16, to have inhibitor activity against PEDV 3CL(pro), despite that SARS-3CL(pro) and PEDV 3CL(pro) share only 45.4% sequence identity. Structural comparison reveals that the majority of residues involved in (R)-16 binding to SARS-3CL(pro) are conserved in PEDV-3CL(pro); however, the sequence variation and positional difference in the loop forming the S(2) pocket may account for large observed difference in IC(50) values. This work advances our understanding of the subtle, but important, differences in coronaviral 3CL(pro) architecture and contributes to the broader structural knowledge of coronaviral 3CL(pro)\u2019s.","publish_time":"2016-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"St. John, Sarah E.; Anson, Brandon J.; Mesecar, Andrew D.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d5cd4faf19ae8838653aa65ea172c97f8bfe9f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4865815.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep25961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27173881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs2OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV","protease S","coronaviral life cycle","SARS-CoV","broader structural knowledge of coronaviral","loop","Structural comparison","pocket","alpha-coronavirus phylogeny","positional difference","inhibitor activity","sequence variation","sequence identity","known inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","large observed difference","\u00C5 X-ray structure","overall structures","appealing target","piglets","crystallization","active site architectures","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","purification","differences","majority of residues","understanding","serious economic impact","mortality rates","development of therapeutics","pigs","work","expression","values","binding","exception","Analysis"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to investigate the gene expression differences of the complement system in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with symptomatic PE and controls. Methods Twenty cases of PE patients and twenty sex and age matched controls were recruited into the study. Human cDNA microarray analysis was used to detect the gene expression difference of the complement system between the two groups. Results 1). Expression of twenty-one genes encoding complement components was detected. In PE patients, expression of the genes encoding C1q\u03B1, C1q\u03B2, C4b, C5 and Factor P was significantly greater (P\u003C0.05) than controls, while C6, C7, C9, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase 1 (MASP1) mRNAs were lower (P\u003C0.05) than controls. 2). Expression of seven genes encoding complement receptors was examined. In PE patients, CR1, integrin \u03B1M, integrin \u03B1X and C5aR mRNAs were significantly up-regulated (P\u003C0.01) compared with controls. 3).

The mRNA expression of CD59 and CD55 was significantly up-regulated (P\u003C0.05), whereas Factor I mRNA was significantly down-regulated (P\u003C0.05) in PE patients than controls. Conclusions In PE patients, the mRNA expressions of complement components, receptors and regulators were unbalanced, suggesting dysfunction and/or deficiency of the complement system, which leads to decreased function of MAC-induced cell lysis in PE patients finally.","publish_time":"2013-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lv, Wei; Wang, Lemin; Duan, Qianglin; Gong, Zhu; Yang, Fan; Song, Haoming; Song, Yanli","journal":"Thrombosis Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50c1c7e04ad2bc4d6bea24917e2d82a0f8950e30.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112067.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23726092/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0049384813001849; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2013.04.027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049384813001849","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PE","Factor P"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of PE patients","complement system","pathogenesis of PE","symptomatic PE","complement receptors","complement regulators","Factor P","mRNA expression of CD59","mRNA expressions of complement components","gene expression differences","age matched controls","mannose-binding lectin","integrin \u03B1M","integrin \u03B1X","C5aR mRNAs","mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase","MASP1","PBMCs","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","induced cell lysis","decreased function of MAC","MBL","C4b","CR1","sex","morbidity rate","C9","disease","C1q\u03B2","C7","C1q\u03B1","Abstract Introduction Pulmonary embolism","high mortality","C6","Human cDNA microarray analysis","dysfunction","CD55","deficiency","Methods","Conclusions","study","groups","Results"],"language":"en"},

Other than the lyssaviruses, they do not appear to cause disease in the reservoir bats, thus an explanation for the dichotomous outcomes of infections of humans and bat reservoirs remains to be determined. Bats appear to have a few unusual features that may account for these differences, including evidence of constitutive interferon (IFN) activation and greater combinatorial diversity in immunoglobulin genes that do not undergo substantial affinity maturation. We propose these features may, in part, account for why bats can host these viruses without disease and how they may contribute to the highly pathogenic nature of bat-borne viruses after spillover into humans. Because of the constitutive IFN activity, bat-borne viruses may be shed at low levels from bat cells. With large naive antibody repertoires, bats may control the limited virus replication without the need for rapid affinity maturation, and this may explain why bats typically have low antibody titers to viruses. However, because bat viruses have evolved in high IFN environments, they have enhanced countermeasures against the IFN response. Thus, upon infection of human cells, where the IFN response is not constitutive, the viruses overwhelm the IFN response, leading to abundant virus replication and pathology.","publish_time":"2017-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schountz, Tony; Baker, Michelle L.; Butler, John; Munster, Vincent","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffcc037270daaf7a3c1869c957f412948e45de17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5604070.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28959255/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01098","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bat viruses","IFN response","important viruses","reservoir bats","bat cells","constitutive IFN activity","humans","bat reservoirs","high IFN environments","substantial disease","pathogenic nature of bat","substantial affinity maturation","lyssaviruses","account","limited virus replication","abundant virus replication","evidence of constitutive interferon","low antibody titers","rapid affinity maturation","low levels","reservoir hosts","unusual features","infection of human cells","large naive antibody repertoires","activation","greater combinatorial diversity","immunoglobulin genes","need","dichotomous outcomes of infections","explanation","coronaviruses","filoviruses","differences","countermeasures","pathology","spillover","henipaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Frameshifting is induced by mRNA secondary structures that compromise ribosome fidelity during decoding of a heptanucleotide \u2018slippery\u2019 sequence. The nsp2 PRF signal of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is distinctive in directing both \u22122 and \u22121 PRF and in its requirement for a trans-acting protein factor, the viral replicase subunit nsp1\u03B2. Here we show that the the trans-activation of frameshifting is carried out by a protein complex composed of nsp1\u03B2 and a cellular poly(C) binding protein (PCBP). From the results of in vitro translation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that a PCBP/nsp1\u03B2 complex binds to a C-rich sequence downstream of the slippery sequence and here mimics the activity of a structured mRNA stimulator of PRF. This is the first description of a role for a trans-acting cellular protein in PRF. The discovery broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly(C) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus\u2013host interactions.","publish_time":"2016-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Napthine, Sawsan; Treffers, Emmely E.; Bell, Susanne; Goodfellow, Ian; Fang, Ying; Firth, Andrew E.; Snijder, Eric J.; Brierley, Ian","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fb5ec70b6d25243856c076c05809c2ed9d49bf1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dcd1759241f327b5235520cebe1f7432aa936c5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4937337.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27257056/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["trans-acting cellular protein","protein complex","trans-acting protein factor","cellular poly","nsp1\u03B2 complex","slippery sequence","C-rich sequence","trans-activation of frameshifting","cellular genes","PCBP","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","viral replicase subunit nsp1\u03B2","binding proteins","nsp2 PRF signal of porcine reproductive","respiratory syndrome virus","new class of virus","mRNA secondary structures","structured mRNA stimulator of","ribosome fidelity","decoding","heptanucleotide","activity","discovery","electrophoretic mobility shift assays","role","requirement","Translational control","host interactions","repertoire of activities","results of","viruses","description"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this study was to produce specific antibody by egg yolk antibody (IgY) to recombinant FanC protein from ETEC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FanC (K99) gene was amplified from ETEC by specific primers and polymerase chain reaction. The gene was cloned and subcloned into pTZ57R/T and pET32a (\u002B) vectors, respectively. Recombinant vector was transferred into E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3). Protein expression was investigated by 1 mM IPTG induction. Hens were immunized by the purified recombinant FanC protein. The activity and specificity of the IgY antibody were detected by dot-blotting, Western blotting, and indirect ELISA. RESULTS: We obtained FanC specific IgYs by immunizing the hens with the recombinant FanC protein. The anti-FanC IgY showed binding specifically to the FanC protein of ETEC.

METHOD: Country selection was based on the poor AFP performance indicators i.e. Non polio AFP rate and stool adequacy. It was recommended that any country not meeting the required indicators should consider environmental surveillance activity as an additional tool to support AFP surveillance. The sites selection considered proximity to the target population, the size of the population to be sampled and the sensitivity of the sampling site. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty three sites have been established in Africa since 2011. In 2011, Nigeria was first country to introduce environmental surveillance and currently with of 59 validated sites, followed by Kenya in 2013 validating and sampling 9 sites and Angola 4 active sites in 2014. In 2014, Cameroon introduced ES and 31 sites followed by Niger with 9 sites and Madagascar with 23 sites. Later in the same year, Chad introduced ES activity and 4 active sites were selected. In 2015 Senegal introduced 3 sites, Guinea and Burkina Faso introduced 4 sites each., and. In 2016, a total of 179 Sabins, 36 Sabin 2s, 196 non polio enteroviruses (NPEV) and 1 vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) were reported in Nigeria.

That region of the mRNA can fold in two mutually exclusive conformations that are in dynamic equilibrium: a structure with two hairpins and a pseudoknot. A mutational analysis provided evidence for the existence and requirement of the pseudoknot for translational control in vivo and S15 recognition in vitro. In this study, we used chemical probing to analyze the structural consequences of mutations and their effect on the stem-loop/pseudoknot equilibrium. Interactions between S15 and the pseudoknot structure were further investigated by footprinting experiments. These data, combined with computer modelling and the previously published data on S15 binding and in vivo control, provide important clues on pseudoknot formation and S15 recognition. An unexpected result is that the relevant control element, here the pseudoknot form, can exist in a variety of topologically equivalent structures recognizable and shapable by S15. S15 sits on the deep groove of the co-axial stack and makes contacts with both stems, shielding the bridging adenine. The only specific sequence determinants are found in the helix common to the pseudoknot and the hairpin structures.","publish_time":"1995-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Philippe, C; B\u00E9nard, L; Portier, C; Westhof, E; Ehresmann, B; Ehresmann, C","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC306625/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S15 binding","pseudoknot structure","pseudoknot equilibrium","S15 recognition","pseudoknot formation","ribosomal protein S15","translational control","mRNA region","relevant control element","ribosome binding site","dynamic equilibrium","hairpin structures","published data","equivalent structures recognizable","important clues","co-axial stack","effect","existence","deep groove","requirement","structural consequences of mutations","stem-loop","stems","chemical probing","evidence","contacts","variety","helix common","exclusive conformations","unexpected result","specific sequence determinants","mutational analysis","computer","hairpins","Interactions","footprinting experiments","bridging adenine","study"],"language":"en"},

This frameshift occurs at a slippery sequence followed by an RNA structure motif that stimulates frameshifting. This motif is commonly assumed to be a simple stem\u2013loop for HIV-1. In this study, we show that the frameshift stimulatory signal is more complex than believed and consists of a two-stem helix. The upper stem\u2013loop corresponds to the classic stem\u2013loop, and the lower stem is formed by pairing the spacer region following the slippery sequence and preceding this classic stem\u2013loop with a segment downstream of this stem\u2013loop. A three-purine bulge interrupts the two stems. This structure was suggested by enzymatic probing with nuclease V1 of an RNA fragment corresponding to the gag/pol frameshift region of HIV-1. The involvement of the novel lower stem in frameshifting was supported by site-directed mutagenesis. A fragment encompassing the gag/pol frameshift region of HIV-1 was inserted in the beginning of the coding sequence of a reporter gene coding for the firefly luciferase, such that expression of luciferase requires a \u20131 frameshift. When the reporter was expressed in COS cells, mutations that disrupt the capacity to form the lower stem reduced frameshifting, whereas compensatory changes that allow re-formation of this stem restored the frameshift efficiency near wild-type level. The two-stem structure that we propose for the frameshift stimulatory signal of HIV-1 differs from the RNA triple helix structure recently proposed.","publish_time":"2002-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dulude, Dominic; Baril, Martin; Brakier-Gingras, L\u00E9a","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC137970/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","COS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stem structure","classic stem","stem helix","simple stem","upper stem","novel lower stem","loop","pol frameshift region of HIV","frameshift efficiency","frameshift stimulatory signal of HIV","RNA structure motif","RNA fragment","RNA triple helix structure","coding sequence","slippery sequence","ribosomal frameshifting","Gag-Pol protein","spacer region","unspliced viral messenger RNA","reporter gene coding","firefly luciferase","expression of luciferase","wild-type level","human immunodeficiency virus type","ribosomes","nuclease V1","compensatory changes","segment","enzymatic probing","capacity","re-formation","COS cells","mutations","Synthesis","involvement","site","purine bulge","stems","beginning","mutagenesis","study"],"language":"en"},

One drug that has shown promising results in vitro is nitazoxanide. Unlike other postulated drugs, nitazoxanide shows a high ratio of maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), after 1 day of 500 mg twice daily (BD), to the concentration required to inhibit 50% replication (EC(50)) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (C(max ): EC(50 )roughly equal to 14:1). As such, it is important to investigate the safety of nitazoxanide for further trials. Furthermore, treatments for COVID-19 should be cheap to promote global access, but prices of many drugs are far higher than the costs of production. We aimed to conduct a review of the safety of nitazoxanide for any prior indication and calculate its minimum costs of production. METHODS: A review of nitazoxanide clinical research was conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched for phase 2 or 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitazoxanide with placebo or active control for 5\u201314 days in participants experiencing acute infections of any kind. Data extracted were grade 1\u20134 and serious adverse events (AEs). Data were also extracted on gastrointestinal (GI) AEs, as well as hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects. Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from the Panjiva database and adjusted for 5% loss during production, costs of excipients, formulation, a 10% profit margin and tax. Two dosages, at 500 mg BD and a higher dose of 1100 mg three times daily (TDS), were considered. Our estimated costs were compared with publicly available list prices from a selection of countries. RESULTS: Nine RCTs of nitazoxanide were identified for inclusion. These RCTs accounted for 1514 participants and an estimated 95.3 person-years-of-follow-up. No significant differences were found in any of the AE endpoints assessed, across all trials or on subgroup analyses of active- or placebo-controlled trials. Mild GI AEs increased with dose. No hepatorenal or cardiovascular concerns were raised, but few appropriate metrics were reported. There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited. Based on a weighted-mean cost of US $61/kg, a 14-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide 500 mg BD would cost $1.41. The daily cost would therefore be $0.10. The same 14-day course could cost $3944 in US commercial pharmacies, and $3 per course in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. At a higher dose of 1100 mg TDS, our estimated cost was $4.08 per 14-day course, equivalent to $0.29 per day. CONCLUSION: Nitazoxanide demonstrates a good safety profile at approved doses. However, further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects, as well as teratogenicity. We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS. Further trials in COVID-19 patients should be initiated. If efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated in clinical studies, nitazoxanide may represent a safe and affordable treatment in the ongoing pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pepperrell, Toby; Pilkington, Victoria; Owen, Andrew; Wang, Junzheng; Hill, Andrew M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15af325f092c29298a36e80431a7837ea6961439.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7213070.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7213070/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs2NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC","ClinicalTrials.gov","AE"],"locations":["Bangladesh","India"],"keyphrases":["safety of nitazoxanide","RCTs of nitazoxanide","day course of treatment","day treatment course","daily cost","review of nitazoxanide clinical research","BD","estimated costs","placebo-controlled trials","higher dose","hepatorenal","COVID","TDS","Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data","randomised controlled trials","minimum costs of production","costs of excipients","cardiovascular concerns","cardiovascular effects","weighted-mean cost of US","active control","affordable treatment","participants","SARS-CoV","Mild GI AEs","treatments","good safety profile","subgroup analyses of active","acute infections","coronavirus disease","postulated drugs","clinical studies","evidence base","teratogenic concerns","promising results","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","available list prices","US commercial pharmacies","high ratio of maximum plasma concentration","formulation","days","EMBASE","prior indication","approved doses","loss","selection of countries","global access","ongoing pandemic","profit margin","serious adverse events","repurposing","kind","Pakistan","India","Bangladesh","phase","CONCLUSION","times","METHODS","MEDLINE databases","person-years","tax","replication","efficacy","AE endpoints","teratogenicity","generic","patients","inclusion","Panjiva database","appropriate metrics","significant differences","BACKGROUND","dosages"],"language":"en"},

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 in Zhejiang province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on \u0022Four-Anti and Two-Balance\u0022 for clinical practice. The \u0022Four-Anti and Two-Balance\u0022 strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinary personalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in 10%patients\u0027 blood samples at acute period and 50%of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifying cytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The \u0022Four-Anti and Two-Balance\u0022 strategy effectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviral effects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favored the balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short period of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbial dysbiosis with decreased probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, so nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore,we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Therefore, two weeks\u0027 quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Kaijin; Cai, Hongliu; Shen, Yihong; Ni, Qin; Chen, Yu; Hu, Shaohua; Li, Jianping; Wang, Huafen; Yu, Liang; Huang, He; Qiu, Yunqing; Wei, Guoqing; Fang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianying; Sheng, Jifang; Liang, Tingbo; Li, Lanjuan","journal":"Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

DESIGN Prospective, descriptive study. METHOD The registry focused on atypical symptoms and co-infections. We hypothesized that patients older than 70 years more often have atypical symptoms. The number of co-infections is unknown. Therefore, we prospectively registered medical history, duration of symptoms, symptoms, temperature, lab results and co-infections of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the period March 4-16th. RESULTS The clinical characteristics of 107 patients were registered. The average age was 71 years and 41% was female. The median duration of symptoms was 5 days. 19% of patients had not been referred to pulmonary or internal medicine. Symptoms were fever (78%), respiratory complaints (78%), chest pain (28%), abdominal pain (13%), and diarrhea (34%). In 54% of the COVID-19 patients at the ED, the temperature was \u2265 38,0\u00B0C, CRP \u2265 50 in 51%, leucocytosis in 12% and elevated LD in 61%.

Early in the previous century there was an outbreak of the Spanish Flue and towards the end of the 60\u0027s, the AIDS epidemic (HIV). Since the start of the current century, several epidemics broke out and spread to various places around the world, for instance, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the Avian Influenza and the Swine Influenza. In 2014 there was an outbreak of Ebola (Ebola virus disease) and in 2015 the Zika virus emerged and there were more. Epidemics cause havoc and impact all areas of life. Each epidemic takes an unfathomable price in lives. It is estimated, for example, that the AIDS epidemic took the lives of some 30 million people. The Corona virus (Covid-19) broke out in China, towards the end of 2019 and spread to most parts of the world. The implications of the outbreak are similar in many countries, among others, due to the uncertainty regarding the way the virus spreads, the appropriate treatment, the lack of vaccination and the high rate of deaths. Naturally, at such times physical protection is a top priority. However, coping with the implications to people\u0027s mental health is no less important and these may result in long-term negative impacts.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shelef, Leah; Zalsman, Gil","journal":"Harefuah","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32431119/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Swine Influenza"],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["spread of epidemics","outbreak of Ebola","virus spreads","smallpox epidemics","AIDS epidemic","Corona virus","Zika virus","Ebola virus disease","example","Epidemics cause havoc","lives","world","implications","end","Avian Influenza","Swine Influenza","current century","previous century","high rate of deaths","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","instance","SARS","lack of vaccination","appropriate treatment","typhus","people\u0027s mental health","way","times physical protection","priority","areas of life","dawn of civilization","uncertainty","plague","various places","Spanish Flue","unfathomable price","HIV","long-term negative impacts","start","countries","Covid","INTRODUCTION","China","parts"],"language":"en"},

Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COVID-19. We aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COVID-19. Methods A search was conducted across EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and ClinicalTrials.gov. All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion. Further analysis of available safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken. Data extracted were adverse events (AEs) grade 1-4, serious AEs and discontinuation for AEs. Specific AEs of interest highlighted in early-phase studies, including gastrointestinal AEs and hyperuricaemia, were also examined. Results Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir. Six were phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison, representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175 person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU). Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir or placebo. Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days. The proportions of grade 1-4 AEs on favipiravir was 28.2% vs 28.4% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was 1.1% vs 1.2% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. For serious AEs the proportion was 0.4% in both arms (P = n.s.). There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8.7% vs 11.5%; P = 0.003]. Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% vs 1.3%; P\u003C0.0001]. Conclusions Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs. However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied. Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment. Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pilkington, Victoria; Pepperrell, Toby; Hill, Andrew","journal":"Journal of virus eradication","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405421/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs5MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ClinicalTrials.gov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical safety of favipiravir","serious AEs","Conclusions Favipiravir","favipiravir vs comparators","existing favipiravir safety evidence","gastrointestinal AEs","widespread use of favipiravir","Specific AEs","potential future use of favipiravir","relevant safety data","phase studies","treatment of COVID","unresolved safety concerns","favourable safety profile","analysis of available safety data","comparison arms","short-term use","pandemic COVID","potential sources of evidence","total","hyperuricaemia","statistical comparison","immediate treatment opportunity","longer-term effects of treatment","proportions of grade","early trials","proportion of discontinuations","relevant grey-literature","umifenovir","caution","Background Repurposing broad-spectrum antivirals","oseltamivir","lopinavir","coronavirus disease","teratogenicity","MEDLINE databases","uric acid elevations","EMBASE","ritonavir","promise","adverse events","Comparator drugs","Ebola","search","placebo","participants","QTc prolongation","limitations","person-years","influenza","Methods","Results","humans","Study follow-up","days","inclusion","PYFU"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 is a serious illness leading to multiple deaths in various countries including the United States. Several million Americans satisfy the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for being high risk. Unfortunately, the available supply of medical beds and equipment for mechanical ventilation are much less than is projected to be needed. The World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple agencies led by the CDC in the United States have attempted to organize intensive outbreak investigation programs utilizing appropriate preventive measures, evaluation, and treatment. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic forms to conditions encompassing multiorgan and systemic manifestations in terms of septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) syndromes. The presently approved treatments are supportive but not curative for the disease. There are multiple treatments being studied. These include vaccines, medications Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine and potentially combination therapy. Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. The cure of COVID-19 is essentially dependent on the patients\u0027 own immune system. When the immune system is over activated in an attempt to kill the virus, this can lead to the production of a large number of inflammatory factors, resulting in severe cytokine storm. The cytokine storm may induce organ damage followed by the edema, dysfunction of air exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and secondary infection, which may lead to death. Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. Additionally, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care have reported guidelines to treat coronavirus patients with stem cells in the hope of decreasing the number of patients going to the ICU, and, also relatively quickly getting them out of ICU. In this manuscript, we describe the urgent need for various solutions, pathogenesis of coronavirus and the clinical evidence for treatment of COVID-19 with stem cells. The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis\u20261. Minimize regulatory burden by all agencies so that critically ill COVID-19 patients will have access regardless of their financial circumstance.2.

At the same time, a new global threat was emerging and would become one of the most devastating global health crises in recorded history. MAIN TEXT: The 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus spread across Europe, North America, and Asia over a 12-month period resulting in an estimated 500 million infections and 50\u2013100 million deaths worldwide, of which ~ 50% of these occurred within the fall of 1918 (Emerg Infect Dis 12:15-22, 2006, Bull Hist Med 76:105-115, 2002). However, the molecular factors that contributed to the emergence of, and subsequent public health catastrophe associated with, the 1918 pandemic virus remained largely unknown until 2005, when the characterization of the reconstructed pandemic virus was announced heralding a new era of advanced molecular investigations (Science 310:77-80, 2005). In the century following the emergence of the 1918 pandemic virus we have landed on the Moon, developed the electronic computer (and a global internet), and have eradicated smallpox. In contrast, we have a largely remedial knowledge and understanding of one of the greatest scourges in recorded history. CONCLUSION: Here, we reflect on the 1918 influenza pandemic, including its emergence and subsequent rapid global spread. In addition, we discuss the pathophysiology associated with the 1918 virus and its predilection for the young and healthy, the rise of influenza therapeutic research following the pandemic, and, finally, our level of preparedness for future pandemics.","publish_time":"2019-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nickol, Michaela E.; Kindrachuk, Jason","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c874a97c374c6cd2375e7c5f0f690ee911dc3dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6364422.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364422/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","North America","Asia"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 pandemic virus","reconstructed pandemic virus","influenza pandemic","emergence","global internet","new global threat","subsequent rapid global spread","devastating global health crises","recorded history","subsequent public health catastrophe","molecular factors","new era of advanced molecular investigations","rise of influenza therapeutic research","Europe","Asia","North America","Science","electronic computer","characterization","MAIN TEXT","level of preparedness","future pandemics","month period","greatest scourges","final year","economic landscape","Moon","predilection","time","eradicated smallpox","spring","infections","Bull Hist Med","pathophysiology","remedial knowledge","fall","contrast","BACKGROUND","Wars","deaths","addition","lives","century","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Specifically, Pseudorabies virus (PRV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Swine influenza virus (SIV) as enveloped viruses and Porcine parvovirus (PPV), Swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) and Senecavirus A (SVA) as non-enveloped viruses, were inoculated in bovine or porcine plasma and subjected to different UV-C irradiation doses (0, 750, 1500, 3000, 6000 and 9000 J/L) using an UV-C device developed for opaque liquid working under turbulent flow. The enveloped viruses tested were inactivated at \u003C 3000 J/L of UV-C, being the dose needed to inactivate 4 log TCID(50) (4D) of 1612 J/L for PRV,1004 J/L for PRRSV, 1953 J/L for PEDV, 1639 J/L for SIV, 1641 J/L for CSFV and 1943 J/L for BVDV. The non-enveloped viruses tended to have higher 4D values: 2161 J/L for PPV, 3223 J/L for SVA and 3708 J/L for SVDV. Because the initial viral concentration was \u003C4.0 Log for PCV-2, it was not possible to calculate the 4D value for this virus. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that the SurePure Turbulator UV-C treatment system is capable of inactivating significant levels of swine viruses inoculated in commercially collected porcine or bovine plasma. It was concluded that irradiation with UV-C can provide an additional redundant biosafety feature in the manufacturing process of spray-dried animal plasma.","publish_time":"2019-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bl\u00E1zquez, Elena; Rodr\u00EDguez, Carmen; R\u00F3denas, Jes\u00FAs; Navarro, N\u00FAria; Riquelme, Cristina; Rosell, Rosa; Campbell, Joy; Crenshaw, Joe; Segal\u00E9s, Joaquim; Pujols, Joan; Polo, Javier","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89a5f1619085d08f719fbf0b8bd1ac5bebd12187.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6383881.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6383881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ5OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","SVA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["porcine plasma","non-enveloped viruses","UV-C device","Pseudorabies virus","Swine influenza virus","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","different UV-C irradiation doses","Bovine viral diarrhea virus","Classical swine fever virus","Swine vesicular disease virus","Porcine parvovirus","bovine plasma","respiratory syndrome virus","SurePure Turbulator UV-C treatment system","inactivation of different enveloped","SurePure Turbulator ultraviolet-C","Porcine circovirus type","liquid animal plasma","capable of inactivating significant levels of swine viruses","dried animal plasma","PRRSV","PPV","PEDV","irradiation equipment","BVDV","CSFV","SVDV","SIV","PRV","PCV","D values","SVA","opaque liquid","log TCID","initial viral concentration","manufacturing process of spray","additional redundant biosafety feature","nm wavelength","effectiveness","results","turbulent flow","Senecavirus","study","objective","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report the identification of a novel Orthobunyavirus species isolated from horse plasma. The identification was based on a straightforward HTS approach. Following enrichment in cell culture, RNA was extracted from the growth medium and rapid library preparation, HTS and primary bioinformatic analyses were performed in less than 12 hours. Taxonomical profiling of the sequencing reads did not reveal sequence similarities to any known virus. Subsequent application of de novo assembly tools to the sequencing reads produced contigs, of which three showed some similarity to the L, M, and S segments of viruses belonging to the Orthobunyavirus genus. Further refinement of these contigs resulted in high-quality, full-length genomic sequences of the three genomic segments (L, M and S) of a novel Orthobunyavirus. Characterization of the genomic sequence, including the prediction of open reading frames and the inspection of consensus genomic termini and phylogenetic analysis, further confirmed that the novel virus is indeed a new species, which we named Ness Ziona virus.","publish_time":"2019-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shifman, Ohad; Cohen-Gihon, Inbar; Beth-Din, Adi; Zvi, Anat; Laskar, Orly; Paran, Nir; Epstein, Eyal; Stein, Dana; Dorozko, Marina; Wolf, Dana; Yitzhaki, Shmuel; Shapira, Shmuel C.; Melamed, Sharon; Israeli, Ofir","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91c7bd831dbc0f6dbbdb2b6f344419a3cb970794.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6399452.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6399452/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HTS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel virus","genomic segments","novel Orthobunyavirus species","Identification","characterization of novel unknown viruses","use of HTS","sequencing reads","throughput sequencing","full-length genomic sequences","characterization of viral pathogens","straightforward HTS approach","based methods","S segments of viruses","contigs","Orthobunyavirus genus","inspection of consensus genomic termini","genomics-based detection of pathogens","Ness Ziona virus","sequence similarities","new species","rapid library preparation","growth medium","novo assembly tools","prediction of open reading frames","RNA","prior assumptions","primary bioinformatic analyses","clinical samples","phylogenetic analysis","way","Subsequent application","great importance","horse plasma","introduction of high","enrichment","cell culture","characteristics","Taxonomical profiling","organisms","refinement","hours","similarity"],"language":"en"},

We used reported case counts and time series from prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use. We modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model that included reproduction numbers from past Ebola outbreaks and a particle filtering method to generate a probabilistic projection of the outbreak size and duration conditioned on its reported trajectory to date; modeled using high (62%), low (44%), and zero (0%) estimates of vaccination coverage (after deployment). Additionally, we used the time series for 18 prior Ebola outbreaks from 1976 to 2016 to parameterize the Thiel-Sen regression model predicting the outbreak size from the number of observed cases from April 4 to May 27. We used these techniques on probable and confirmed case counts with and without inclusion of suspected cases. Probabilistic projections were scored against the actual outbreak size of 54 EVD cases, using a log-likelihood score. With the stochastic model, using high, low, and zero estimates of vaccination coverage, the median outbreak sizes for probable and confirmed cases were 82 cases (95% prediction interval [PI]: 55, 156), 104 cases (95% PI: 58, 271), and 213 cases (95% PI: 64, 1450), respectively. With the Thiel-Sen regression model, the median outbreak size was estimated to be 65.0 probable and confirmed cases (95% PI: 48.8, 119.7). Among our three mathematical models, the stochastic model with suspected cases and high vaccine coverage predicted total outbreak sizes closest to the true outcome. Relatively simple mathematical models updated in real time may inform outbreak response teams with projections of total outbreak size and duration.","publish_time":"2019-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelly, J.

AIM: To introduce visual tools to assess automatically identified clusters. METHODS: We developed tools to visualise: (i) clusters found in dimensions of time, geographical location and genetic data; (ii) nested sub-clusters within identified clusters; (iii) intra-cluster pairwise dissimilarities per dimension; (iv) intra-cluster correlation between dimensions. We applied our tools to notified mumps cases in the Netherlands with available disease onset date (January 2009 \u2013 June 2016), geographical information (location of residence), and pathogen sequence data (n = 112). We compared identified clusters to clusters reported by the Netherlands Early Warning Committee (NEWC). RESULTS: We identified five mumps clusters. Three clusters were considered plausible. One was questionable because, in phylogenetic analysis, genetic sequences related to it segregated in two groups. One was implausible with no smaller nested clusters, high intra-cluster dissimilarities on all dimensions, and low intra-cluster correlation between dimensions. The NEWC reports concurred with our findings: the plausible/questionable clusters corresponded to reported outbreaks; the implausible cluster did not. CONCLUSION: Our tools for assessing automatically identified clusters allow outbreak investigators to rapidly spot plausible transmission clusters for mumps and other human-to-human transmissible diseases.

In the authors\u0027 previous studies, the lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) was confirmed to exert a function in distraction osteogenesis (DO) during the healing of a condylar fracture, which resulted in the formation of excess bone. The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in the expression of any associated genes via an Affymetrix GeneChip method. The traumatic TMJA model was fabricated by a condylar fracture in the TMJ area of sheep with either a dissected LPM (LPD) or normal (LPN). The untreated sheep served as a control. At 4- and 12 weeks post-surgery, the condylar zone was isolated to perform the gene chip analysis, which was performed according to a standard Affymetrix protocol. The validated genes were further evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The gene chip analysis indicated that the LPN gene expression pattern was similar compared with the DO process, while LPD was similar to that of normal bone fracture healing. The validated genes were collagen type II \u03B11 chain, C-type lectin domain family 3 member A, interleukin 1A, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, chondromodulin (LECT1), calcitonin receptor (CALCR), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B21, Fos proto-oncogene (FOS), bone \u03B3-carboxyglutamate protein and bone morphogenic protein (BMP)7, among which, BMP7, LECT1, CALCR and FOS were confirmed by RT-qPCR.

In Japan, the test and culling policy is a basic control measure, and implementation of an adequate vaccination program is recommended as a national policy. In addition, optional control measures, including compulsory testing of introduced animals and bulk tank milk (BTM) testing as a mass screening method, are used in several provinces, but their efficacy has not been completely assessed. We evaluated these control measures using the scenario tree model of BVD in Japan, developed in the previous study. The model outputs indicated that compulsory testing of all introduced cattle, rather than only heifers and/or non-vaccinated cattle, was cost effective and reduced the risk of BVDV introduction due to animal movement and that BTM testing could effectively monitor most part of the cattle population. Vaccination coverage and BVDV prevalence among introduced cattle could also affect the cost effectiveness of compulsory testing of targeted cattle, particularly under low vaccination coverage or high BVDV prevalence. However, even with the implementation of a highly effective monitoring scheme for many years, BVD risk could not be eliminated; it instead converged at a very low level (0.02%).

Infection also consistently leads to transient immune-suppression. BoHV-1 is the number one infectious agent in cattle that is associated with abortions in cattle. BoHV-1, as other \u03B1-herpesvirinae subfamily members, establishes latency in sensory neurons. Stressful stimuli, mimicked by the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone, consistently induce reactivation from latency in latently infected calves and rabbits. Increased corticosteroid levels due to stress have a two-pronged effect on reactivation from latency by: (1) directly stimulating viral gene expression and replication, and (2) impairing antiviral immune responses, thus enhancing virus spread and transmission. BoHV-1 encodes several proteins, bICP0, bICP27, gG, UL49.5, and VP8, which interfere with key antiviral innate immune responses in the absence of other viral genes. Furthermore, the ability of BoHV-1 to infect lymphocytes and induce apoptosis, in particular CD4\u002B T cells, has negative impacts on immune responses during acute infection. BoHV-1 induced immune-suppression can initiate the poly-microbial disorder known as bovine respiratory disease complex, which costs the US cattle industry more than one billion dollars annually. Furthermore, interfering with antiviral responses may promote viral spread to ovaries and the developing fetus, thus enhancing reproductive issues associated with BoHV-1 infection of cows or pregnant cows. The focus of this review is to describe the known mechanisms, direct and indirect, by which BoHV-1 interferes with antiviral immune responses during the course of infection.","publish_time":"2019-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, Clinton","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2005ffa70562f5f03b57f0d19f4d63e807762964.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6514135.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6514135/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral immune responses","antiviral responses","Infection of cattle","ability of BoHV","infection of cows","key antiviral innate immune responses","latency","transient immune-suppression","induced immune-suppression","acute infection","course of infection","viral spread","reactivation","US cattle industry","viral genes","viral gene expression","bovine respiratory disease complex","bovine herpesvirus","upper respiratory tract disorders","genital disorders","pregnant cows","known mechanisms","synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone","Increased corticosteroid levels","negative impacts","T cells","conjunctivitis","absence","poly-microbial disorder","developing fetus","particular CD4","ovaries","\u03B1-herpesvirinae subfamily members","two-pronged effect","reproductive issues","UL49","bICP0","bICP27","gG","apoptosis","proteins","infected calves","number","sensory neurons","review","replication","rabbits","infectious agent","VP8","lymphocytes","Stressful stimuli","dollars","abortions","focus","transmission"],"language":"en"},

An efficacious vaccine would be an important step towards decreasing the disease burden caused by CHIKV infection. Despite no licensed vaccine is yet available for CHIKV, there is strong evidence of effective asymptomatic viral clearance due to neutralising antibodies against the viral structural proteins. We have designed viral-vectored vaccines to express the structural proteins of CHIKV, using the replication-deficient chimpanzee adenoviral platform, ChAdOx1. Expression of the CHIKV antigens results in the formation of chikungunya virus-like particles. Our vaccines induce high frequencies of anti-chikungunya specific T-cell responses as well as high titres of anti-CHIKV E2 antibodies with high capacity for in vitro neutralisation.

In our study, we isolated and characterized the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of the porcine TGFBR2 gene and microRNA-1306 (miR-1306) was identified as the functional miRNA that targets TGFBR2 in porcine granulosa cells (GCs).

Moreover, we identified the miR-1306 core promoter and found three potential SMAD4-binding elements (SBEs). Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that the transcription factor SMAD4 directly binds to the miR-1306 core promoter and inhibits its transcriptional activity.

We illustrate possible applications of machine learning for public health practitioners that can be applied to generate evidence on program effectiveness and improve implementation. Kilkari is an outbound service that delivers weekly gestational age\u2013appropriate audio messages about pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare directly to families on their mobile phones, starting from the second trimester of pregnancy until the child is one year old. Mobile Academy is an Interactive Voice Response audio training course for accredited social health activists (ASHAs) in India. METHODS: Study participants include pregnant and postpartum women (Kilkari) as well as frontline health workers (Mobile Academy) across 13 states in India. Data elements are drawn from system-generated databases used in the routine implementation of programs to provide users with health information. We explain the structure and elements of the extracted data and the proposed process for their linkage. We then outline the various steps to be undertaken to evaluate and select final algorithms for identifying gaps in data quality, poor user performance, predictors for call receipt, user listening levels, and linkages between early listening and continued engagement. RESULTS: The project has obtained the necessary approvals for the use of data in accordance with global standards for handling personal data. The results are expected to be published in August/September 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous evaluations of digital health programs are limited, and few have included applications of machine learning. By describing the steps to be undertaken in the application of machine learning approaches to the analysis of routine system-generated data, we aim to demystify the use of machine learning not only in evaluating digital health education programs but in improving their performance. Where articles on analysis offer an explanation of the final model selected, here we aim to emphasize the process, thereby illustrating to program implementors and evaluators with limited exposure to machine learning its relevance and potential use within the context of broader program implementation and evaluation.

Here, we describe our participation in a weekly prospective ILI forecasting challenge for the United States for the 2016-17 season and subsequent evaluation of our performance. We implemented a metapopulation model framework with 32 model variants. Variants differed from each other in their assumptions about: the force-of-infection (FOI); use of uninformative priors; the use of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and the treatment of regions as either independent or coupled. Individual model variants were chosen subjectively as the basis for our weekly forecasts; however, a subset of coupled models were only available part way through the season. Most frequently, during the 2016-17 season, we chose; FOI variants with both school vacations and humidity terms; uninformative priors; the inclusion of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and coupled regions (when available). Our near-term weekly forecasts substantially over-estimated incidence early in the season when coupled models were not available. However, our forecast accuracy improved in absolute terms and relative to other teams once coupled solutions were available. In retrospective analysis, we found that the 2016-17 season was not typical: on average, coupled models performed better when fit without historically augmented data. Also, we tested a simple ensemble model for the 2016-17 season and found that it underperformed our subjective choice for all forecast targets. In this study, we were able to improve accuracy during a prospective forecasting exercise by coupling dynamics between regions. Although reduction of forecast subjectivity should be a long-term goal, some degree of human intervention is likely to improve forecast accuracy in the medium-term in parallel with the systematic consideration of more sophisticated ensemble approaches.","publish_time":"2019-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ben-Nun, Michal; Riley, Pete; Turtle, James; Bacon, David P.; Riley, Steven","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f2a5b356d46600dfa40b61958808eaaa105bef4.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7732ed94fb45c64d27fad1fad250e7937b3d4abc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6557527.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6557527/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcwMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","FOI"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["coupled regions","forecast accuracy","week of season onset","subset of coupled models","near-term weekly forecasts","FOI variants","Individual model variants","near-term weekly incidence","forecast targets","use of discounted historical data","simple ensemble model","weekly prospective ILI forecasting challenge","uninformative priors","week of peak","inclusion of discounted historical data","reduction of forecast subjectivity","treatment of regions","metapopulation model framework","time points","augmented data","prospective forecasting exercise","forecasts of key metrics","humidity terms","absolute terms","intensity of peak","over-estimated incidence","sophisticated ensemble approaches","school vacations","systematic consideration","degree of human intervention","long-term goal","influenza","teams","United States","illness","Health planners","dynamics","participation","way","force","subjective choice","solutions","subsequent evaluation","performance","average","basis","infection","assumptions","retrospective analysis","study"],"language":"en"},

Many other factors limit the reliability of preclinical models and may contribute to preclinical research failure in critical care, including the host specificity of several pathogens, the fact that laboratory animals are raised in pathogen-free facilities and that organ support techniques are either absent or minimal.

In eukaryotic cells, polyamines facilitate processes such as transcription, translation, and DNA replication, and viruses similarly rely on polyamines to facilitate transcription and translation. Whether polyamines function at additional stages in viral replication remains poorly understood. Picornaviruses, including Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), are sensitive to polyamine depletion both in vitro and in vivo; however, precisely how polyamine function in picornavirus infection has not been described. Here, we describe CVB3 mutants that arise with passage in polyamine-depleted conditions. We observe mutations in the 2A and 3C proteases, and we find that these mutant proteases confer resistance to polyamine depletion. Using a split luciferase reporter system to measure protease activity, we determined that polyamines facilitate viral protease activity. We further observe that the 2A and 3C protease mutations enhance reporter protease activity in polyamine-depleted conditions. Finally, we find that these mutations promote cleavage of cellular eIF4G during infection of polyamine-depleted cells. In sum, our results suggest that polyamines are crucial to protease function during picornavirus infection. Further, these data highlight viral proteases as potential antiviral targets and highlight how CVB3 may overcome polyamine-depleting antiviral therapies.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dial, Courtney N.; Tate, Patrick M.; Kicmal, Thomas M.; Mounce, Bryan C.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/534a301ea6a76eb47c8d42e30981088ac5603418.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6563312.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6563312/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection of polyamine","polyamine function","polyamines function","polyamine depletion","protease function","polyamine-depleted conditions","viral protease activity","reporter protease activity","C protease mutations","viral replication","depleted cells","viral proteases","eukaryotic cells","picornavirus infection","C proteases","DNA replication","CVB3 mutants","mutant proteases","transcription","translation","RNA virus replication","antiviral therapies","potential antiviral targets","split luciferase reporter system","molecules abundant","cleavage of cellular eIF4G","passage","processes","additional stages","data","resistance","Coxsackievirus B3","Picornaviruses","results","sum"],"language":"en"},

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that antibiotic resistance could cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050. Multidrug-resistant bacteria are the cause of infection in at least one in three people suffering from septicemia. While antibiotics are powerful agents against infectious diseases, the alarming increase in antibiotic resistance is of great concern. Alternatives are desperately needed, and nanotechnology provides a great opportunity to develop novel approaches for the treatment of infectious diseases. One of the most important factors in the prognosis of an infection caused by an antibiotic resistant bacteria is an early and rigorous diagnosis, jointly with the use of novel therapeutic systems that can specifically target the pathogen and limit the selection of resistant strains. Nanodiamonds can be used as antimicrobial agents due to some of their properties including size, shape, and biocompatibility, which make them highly suitable for the development of efficient and tailored nanotherapies, including vaccines or drug delivery systems. In this review, we discuss the beneficial findings made in the nanodiamonds field, focusing on diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. We also highlight the innovative platform that nanodiamonds confer for vaccine improvement, drug delivery, and shuttle systems, as well as their role in the generation of faster and more sensitive clinical diagnosis.","publish_time":"2019-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Torres Sangiao, Eva; Holban, Alina Maria; Gestal, M\u00F3nica Cartelle","journal":"Materials (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db864a0b9b9bddd9b5ea861011655f363d90b149.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6567273.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6567273/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzcxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of infectious diseases","antibiotic resistant bacteria","antibiotic resistance","cause of infection","drug delivery systems","rigorous diagnosis","Multidrug-resistant bacteria","nanodiamonds field","shuttle systems","year","use of novel therapeutic systems","sensitive clinical diagnosis","selection of resistant strains","novel approaches","great opportunity","powerful agents","great concern","antimicrobial agents","millions of deaths","vaccine improvement","vaccines","alarming increase","tailored nanotherapies","estimates","development of efficient","generation of faster","beneficial findings","antibiotics","innovative platform","World Health Organization","biocompatibility","size","shape","nanotechnology","properties","prognosis","role","pathogen","important factors","review","people","septicemia","Alternatives"],"language":"en"},

TIM-1 expression has been implicated in Ebola virus (EBOV) pathogenesis; however, it remains unclear whether this is due to TIM-1 serving as a filovirus receptor in vivo or, as others have suggested, TIM-1 induces a cytokine storm elicited by T cell/virion interactions. Here, we use a BSL2 model virus that expresses EBOV glycoprotein to demonstrate the importance of TIM-1 as a virus receptor late during in vivo infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Infectious, GFP-expressing recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding either full length EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP/rVSV) or mucin domain deleted EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP\u0394O/rVSV) was used to assess the role of TIM-1 during in vivo infection. GFP-expressing rVSV encoding its native glycoprotein G (G/rVSV) served as a control. TIM-1-sufficient or TIM-1-deficient BALB/c interferon \u03B1/\u03B2 receptor(-/-) mice were challenged with these viruses. While G/rVSV caused profound morbidity and mortality in both mouse strains, TIM-1-deficient mice had significantly better survival than TIM-1-expressing mice following EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GP\u0394O/rVSV challenge. EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GP\u0394O/rVSV in spleen of infected animals was high and unaffected by expression of TIM-1. However, infectious virus in serum, liver, kidney and adrenal gland was reduced late in infection in the TIM-1-deficient mice, suggesting that virus entry via this receptor contributes to virus load. Consistent with higher virus loads, proinflammatory chemokines trended higher in organs from infected TIM-1-sufficient mice compared to the TIM-1-deficient mice, but proinflammatory cytokines were more modestly affected. To assess the role of T cells in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis, T cells were depleted in TIM-1-sufficient and -deficient mice and the mice were challenged with virus. Depletion of T cells did not alter the pathogenic consequences of virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies provide evidence that at late times during EBOV GP/rVSV infection, TIM-1 increased virus load and associated mortality, consistent with an important role of this receptor in virus entry. This work suggests that inhibitors which block TIM-1/virus interaction may serve as effective antivirals, reducing virus load at late times during EBOV infection.","publish_time":"2019-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brunton, Bethany; Rogers, Kai; Phillips, Elisabeth K.; Brouillette, Rachel B.; Bouls, Ruayda; Butler, Noah S.; Maury, Wendy","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61aa22d85170a908912fd1f0c0f86ea251b4e311.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6615641.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6615641/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["TIM"],"organizations":["PS","EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of TIM","EBOV infection","infected TIM","expression of TIM","importance of TIM","rVSV infection","EBOV GP\u0394O","infectious virus","virus interaction","Ebola virus","rVSV pathogenesis","deficient mice","length EBOV glycoprotein","rVSV challenge","increased virus load","higher virus loads","pathogenic consequences of virus infection","sufficient mice","BSL2 model virus","mucin domain deleted EBOV glycoprotein","recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus","role of T cells","filovirus receptor","\u03B2 receptor","Depletion of T cells","deficient BALB","late times","native glycoprotein G","T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain","mediating filovirus entry","GFP","PS","important role","associated mortality","proinflammatory chemokines","virion interactions","proinflammatory cytokines","spleen of infected animals","liver","c interferon \u03B1","profound morbidity","effective antivirals","kidney","serum","BACKGROUND","mouse strains","evidence","organs","adrenal gland","cytokine storm","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","studies","phosphatidylserine","better survival","METHODOLOGY","virions","CONCLUSIONS","work","inhibitors","viruses","control"],"language":"en"},

Germfree mice or animals that receive antibiotics are unable to control viral replication within the brain leading to increased paralysis. Microglia derived from germfree or antibiotic-treated animals cannot stimulate viral-specific immunity and microglia depletion leads to worsened demyelination. Oral administration of toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands to virally infected germfree mice limits neurologic damage. Homeostatic activation of microglia is dependent on intrinsic signaling through TLR4, as disruption of TLR4 within microglia, but not the entire CNS (excluding microglia), leads to increased viral-induced clinical disease.

However, few studies have used Internet search query or social media data to monitor spatial and temporal trends of avian influenza in China. This study investigated the potential of using search query and social media data in detecting and monitoring avian influenza A (H7N9) cases in humans in China. We collected weekly data on laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases in humans, as well as H7N9-related Baidu Search Index (BSI) and Weibo Posting Index (WPI) data in China from 2013 to 2017, to explore the spatial and temporal trends of H7N9 cases and H7N9-related Internet search queries. Our findings showed a positive relationship of H7N9 cases with BSI and WPI search queries spatially and temporally. The outbreak threshold time and peak time of H7N9-related BSI and WPI searches preceded H7N9 cases in most years.

HYPOTHESIS: Evidence of ACE2 can be found in tissues and plasma of dogs. Equilibrium concentrations of renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) APs differ in dogs with heart disease compared to healthy dogs and recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) alters relative concentrations of APs. ANIMALS: Forty\u2010nine dogs with and 34 dogs without heart disease. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and assays for tissue and plasma ACE2 activity and equilibrium concentrations of plasma RAAS APs were performed. RESULTS: Immunolabeling for ACE2 was present in kidney and myocardial tissue. Median plasma ACE2 activity was significantly increased in dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF; 6.9 mU/mg; interquartile range [IQR], 5.1\u201012.1) as compared to control (2.2 mU/mg; IQR, 1.8\u20103.0; P = .0003).

A growing body of information clearly indicates that excess ROS/RNS production and oxidative stress are major detrimental consequences of the most common commercial stressors in poultry production. During evolution, antioxidant defence systems were developed in poultry to survive in an oxygenated atmosphere. They include a complex network of internally synthesised (e.g., antioxidant enzymes, (glutathione) GSH, (coenzyme Q) CoQ) and externally supplied (vitamin E, carotenoids, etc.) antioxidants. In fact, all antioxidants in the body work cooperatively as a team to maintain optimal redox balance in the cell/body. This balance is a key element in providing the necessary conditions for cell signalling, a vital process for regulation of the expression of various genes, stress adaptation and homeostasis maintenance in the body. Since ROS/RNS are considered to be important signalling molecules, their concentration is strictly regulated by the antioxidant defence network in conjunction with various transcription factors and vitagenes. In fact, activation of vitagenes via such transcription factors as Nrf2 leads to an additional synthesis of an array of protective molecules which can deal with increased ROS/RNS production. Therefore, it is a challenging task to develop a system of optimal antioxidant supplementation to help growing/productive birds maintain effective antioxidant defences and redox balance in the body. On the one hand, antioxidants, such as vitamin E, or minerals (e.g., Se, Mn, Cu and Zn) are a compulsory part of the commercial pre-mixes for poultry, and, in most cases, are adequate to meet the physiological requirements in these elements. On the other hand, due to the aforementioned commercially relevant stressors, there is a need for additional support for the antioxidant system in poultry. This new direction in improving antioxidant defences for poultry in stress conditions is related to an opportunity to activate a range of vitagenes (via Nrf2-related mechanisms: superoxide dismutase, SOD; heme oxygenase-1, HO-1; GSH and thioredoxin, or other mechanisms: Heat shock protein (HSP)/heat shock factor (HSP), sirtuins, etc.) to maximise internal AO protection and redox balance maintenance. Therefore, the development of vitagene-regulating nutritional supplements is on the agenda of many commercial companies worldwide.","publish_time":"2019-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Surai, Peter F.; Kochish, Ivan I.; Fisinin, Vladimir I.; Kidd, Michael T.","journal":"Antioxidants (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/204a803a89944c81ecd8b50ddfb85e78db5df7f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6680731.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6680731/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzgzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ROS/RNS","GSH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antioxidant system","poultry production","antioxidant enzymes","antioxidant defence network","effective antioxidant defences","antioxidant defence systems","redox balance maintenance","system of optimal antioxidant supplementation","optimal redox balance","RNS production","body work","antioxidants","common commercial stressors","growing body of information","stress conditions","range of vitagenes","commercial settings","commercial companies","range of stressors","oxidative stress","stress adaptation","HSP","various transcription factors","Nrf2-related mechanisms","cell signalling","GSH","activation of vitagenes","excess ROS","increased ROS","commercial pre-mixes","vitamin E","relevant stressors","hand","Heat shock protein","heat shock factor","important signalling molecules","necessary conditions","homeostasis maintenance","additional synthesis","additional support","complex network","expression of various genes","array of protective molecules","superoxide dismutase","major detrimental consequences","conjunction","SOD","regulation","productive birds","vital process","internal AO protection","heme oxygenase","glutathione","need","team","nutritional supplements","Mn","Zn","coenzyme Q","agenda","minerals","CoQ","sirtuins","key element","thioredoxin","concentration","opportunity","new direction","physiological requirements","development of vitagene","evolution","carotenoids","challenging task","elements","oxygenated atmosphere","cases"],"language":"en"},

Despite the widespread use of inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, the emergence of antigenic variants and the influence of maternal antibodies have raised some concerns regarding the efficacy of commercial vaccines. While no specific antiviral therapy for CPV infection exists, the only treatment option for the infection is supportive therapy based on symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent medical need to develop antiviral therapeutic options to reduce the burden of CPV-related disease. In this study, a cytopathic effect (CPE)-based high-throughput screening assay was used to screen CPV inhibitors from a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library. After two rounds of screening, seven out of 1430 screened drugs were found to have \u003E50% CPE inhibition. Three drugs\u2014Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel\u2014with higher anti-CPV effects were further evaluated in F81 cells by absolute PCR quantification and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The inhibitory effects of all three drugs were dose-dependent. Time of addition assay indicated that the drugs inhibited the early processes of the CPV replication cycle, and the inhibition effects were relatively high within 2 h postinfection. Western blot assay also showed that the three drugs had broad-spectrum antiviral activity against different subspecies of three CPV variants. In addition, antiapoptotic effects were observed within 12 h in Nitazoxanide-treated F81 cells regardless of CPV infection, while Closantel Sodium- or Closantel-treated cells had no pro- or antiapoptotic effects. In conclusion, Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel can effectively inhibit different subspecies of CPV. Since the safety profiles of FDA-approved drugs have already been extensively studied, these three drugs can potentially become specific and effective anti-CPV drugs.","publish_time":"2019-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhou, Hongzhuan; Su, Xia; Lin, Lulu; Zhang, Jin; Qi, Qi; Guo, Fangfang; Xu, Fuzhou; Yang, Bing","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/436164085d9fd52ea5d7ebed65465e0a41495c04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6724046.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6724046/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPV","Food and Drug Administration","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CPV infection","CPV variants","burden of CPV","CPV inhibitors","effective anti-CPV drugs","approved drugs","different subspecies of CPV","Closantel Sodium","higher anti-CPV effects","screened drugs","CPV replication cycle","Closantel-treated cells","antiapoptotic effects","inhibition effects","inhibitory effects","Nitazoxanide-treated F81 cells","specific antiviral therapy","Time of addition assay","high-throughput screening assay","indirect immunofluorescence assay","Western blot assay","CPE inhibition","antiviral therapeutic options","broad-spectrum antiviral activity","approved drug library","Drug Administration","supportive therapy","h postinfection","rounds of screening","live attenuated vaccines","emergence of antigenic variants","safety profiles of FDA","efficacy of commercial vaccines","absolute PCR quantification","concerns","common etiological agent of acute enteritis","Food","treatment option","early processes","widespread use of inactivated","influence of maternal antibodies","urgent medical need","IFA","cytopathic effect","study","symptoms","related disease","conclusion","Canine parvovirus","dose-dependent","wild carnivores"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether early NIV can reduce the need for invasive ventilation in patients with pneumonia-induced early mild ARDS. METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of NIV compared with conventional administration of oxygen through a Venturi mask. Primary outcome included the numbers of patients who met the intubation criteria. RESULTS: Two hundred subjects were randomized to NIV (n = 102) or control (n = 98) groups from 21 centers. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. In the NIV group, PaO(2)/FIO(2) became significantly higher than in the control group at 2 h after randomization and remained stable for the first 72 h. NIV did not decrease the proportion of patients requiring intubation than in the control group (11/102 vs. 9/98, 10.8% vs. 9.2%, p = 0.706). The ICU mortality was similar in the two groups (7/102 vs. 7/98, 4.9% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.721). Multivariate analysis showed minute ventilation greater than 11 L/min at 48 h was the independent risk factor for NIV failure (OR, 1.176 [95% CI, 1.005\u20131.379], p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with NIV did not reduce the need for intubation among patients with pneumonia-induced early mild ARDS, despite the improved PaO(2)/FIO(2) observed with NIV compared with standard oxygen therapy. High minute ventilation may predict NIV failure. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01581229.

PPE effectiveness is often undermined by inappropriate doffing methods. Our knowledge of how HCWs approach doffing PPE in practice is limited. In this qualitative study, we examine HCWs\u2019 perspectives about doffing PPE. METHODS: Thirty participants at a Midwestern academic hospital were recruited and assigned to 1 of 3 doffing simulation scenarios: 3 mask designs (n = 10), 2 gown designs (n = 10), or 2 glove designs (n = 10). Participants were instructed to doff PPE as they would in routine practice. Their performances were video-recorded and reviewed with participants. Semistructured interviews about their doffing approaches were conducted and audio-recorded, then transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Three overarching themes were identified in interviews: doffing strategies, cognitive processes, and barriers and facilitators. Doffing strategies included doffing safely (minimizing self-contamination) and doffing expediently (eg, ripping PPE off). Cognitive processes during doffing largely pertained to tracking contaminated PPE surfaces, examining PPE design cues (eg, straps), or improvising based on prior experience from training or similar PPE designs. Doffing barriers and facilitators typically related to PPE design, such as PPE fit (or lack of it) and fastener type. Some participants also described personal barriers (eg, glasses, long hair); however, some PPE designs helped mitigate these barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve HCWs\u2019 doffing performance need to address HCWs\u2019 preferences for both safety and expediency when using PPE, which has implications for PPE design, training approaches, and hospital policies and procedures.","publish_time":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baloh, Jure; Reisinger, Heather Schacht; Dukes, Kimberly; da Silva, Jaqueline Pereira; Salehi, Hugh P; Ward, Melissa; Chasco, Emily E; Pennathur, Priyadarshini R; Herwaldt, Loreen","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b22861aa553b97e42e6a1b95b744e0ec2dcd6b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6743502.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6743502/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["doffing PPE","Doffing barriers","PPE fit","PPE effectiveness","doffing approaches","doffing strategies","similar PPE designs","PPE design cues","contaminated PPE surfaces","inappropriate doffing methods","doffing performance need","doffing simulation scenarios","participants","HCWs approach","mask designs","personal barriers","gown designs","glove designs","training approaches","cognitive processes","facilitators","hospital policies","Semistructured interviews","cross-contamination","self-contamination","routine practice","Personal protective equipment","Midwestern academic hospital","preferences","pathogens","implications","prior experience","healthcare workers","glasses","lack","BACKGROUND","Efforts","safety","perspectives","overarching themes","procedures","long hair","expediency","straps","knowledge","qualitative study","fastener type","RESULTS","video","CONCLUSIONS","audio","performances"],"language":"en"},

While some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known about how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors that can have dire consequences if uncorrected. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3\u2032 end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. The postdecoding mRNA:rRNA interaction not only contributes to predominant translational pausing, but also provides a retrospective mechanism to safeguard the ribosome in the correct reading frame. Partially eliminating the AUG-like \u201Csticky\u201D codons in the reporter message leads to increased \u002B1 frameshift errors. Remarkably, mutating the highly conserved CAU triplet of 18S rRNA globally changes the codon \u201Cstickiness\u201D. Further supporting the role of \u201Csticky\u201D sequences in reading frame maintenance, the codon composition of open reading frames is highly optimized across eukaryotic genomes. These results suggest an important layer of information embedded within the protein-coding sequences that instructs the ribosome to ensure reading frame fidelity during translation.","publish_time":"2018-09-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wan, Ji; Gao, Xiangwei; Mao, Yuanhui; Zhang, Xingqian; Qian, Shu-Bing","journal":"Research (Wash D C)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b8eca79a2c4625f1ebc17b342a1755253ba473f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6750092.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["correct reading frame","translating ribosome","reading frame maintenance","reading frame fidelity","S rRNA","codon composition of open reading frames","hundreds of codons","rRNA interaction","start codon","high resolution ribosome profiling data sets","spontaneous frameshift errors","protein-coding sequences","reporter message leads","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","order","dire consequences","important layer of information","conserved CAU triplet","end","sequence elements","eukaryotic genomes","predominant translational pausing","results","PRF","postdecoding mRNA","functional proteins","retrospective mechanism","decoding process","initiation","role","stickiness"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of \u003C1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) \u003C 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.","publish_time":"2019-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsairidou, Smaragda; Anacleto, O.; Woolliams, J.

These findings suggest that PEGylated C34 with broad-spectrum anti-HIV-1 activity and prolonged half-life can be further developed as a peptide fusion inhibitor-based long-acting anti-HIV drug for clinical use to treat HIV-infected patients who have failed to respond to current anti-retrovirus drugs.","publish_time":"2019-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Chen; Cheng, Shuihong; Zhang, Yuanyuan; Ding, Yibo; Chong, Huihui; Xing, Hui; Jiang, Shibo; Li, Xuebing; Ma, Liying","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2d560b5f6bd9fcad15c0b5e6e4284cfe9386e3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6784077.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6784077/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["inhibited HIV","broad-spectrum anti-HIV","anti-HIV drug","PEG5kC34","nM","laboratory-adapted HIV","HIV-infected patients","clinical application of HIV fusion inhibitor","PEGylated C34 peptides","peptides PEG2kC34","PEGylated peptides","cell fusion","peptide fusion inhibitor","clinical use","clinical isolates","activity","mean EC","prolonged half-life","fold","plasma half-life","short half-life","current anti-retrovirus drugs","peptide N36","high affinity complexes","Env-mediated cell","high \u03B1-helicity","effective concentration","enfuvirtide","strain NL4","PEG chain length","China","T20","inhibition","infection","mechanisms of action","findings","kDa"],"language":"en"},

Antemortem oral swabs were collected from 639 snakes from 12 US collections, including 62 species, 28 genera, and 6 families: Pythonidae (N = 414 snakes; pythons were overrepresented in the sample population), Boidae (79), Colubridae (116), Lamprophiidae (4), Elapidae (12), and Viperidae (14). Infection was more common in pythons (38%; 95% CI: 33.1\u201342.4%), and in boas (10%; 95% CI: 5.2\u201318.7%) than in colubrids (0.9%, 95% CI: \u003C0.01\u20134.7%); infection was not detected in other snake families (lamprophiids 0/4, 95% CI: 0\u201349%; elapids 0/12, 95% CI: 0\u201324.2%; and vipers 0/14, 95% CI: 0\u201321.5%), but more of these snakes need to be tested to confirm these findings. Clinical signs of respiratory disease were common in infected pythons (85 of 144). Respiratory signs were only observed in 1 of 8 infected boas and were absent in the single infected colubrid. Divergent serpentoviruses were detected in pythons, boas, and colubrids, suggesting that different serpentoviruses might vary in their ability to infect snakes of different families. Older snakes were more likely to be infected than younger snakes (p-value \u003C 0.001) but males and females were equally likely to be infected (female prevalence: 23.4%, 95% CI 18.7\u201328.9%; male prevalence: 23.5%, 95% CI 18\u201330.1%; p-value = 0.144). Neither age (p-value = 0.32) nor sex (p-value = 0.06) was statistically associated with disease severity. Longitudinal sampling of pythons in a single collection over 28 months revealed serpentovirus infection is persistent, and viral clearance was not observed. In this collection, infection was associated with significantly increased rates of mortality (p-value = 0.001) with death of 75% of infected pythons and no uninfected pythons over this period. Offspring of infected parents were followed: vertical transmission either does not occur or occurs with a much lower efficiency than horizontal transmission. Overall, these findings confirm that serpentoviruses pose a significant threat to the health of captive python populations and can cause infection in boa and colubrid species.","publish_time":"2019-10-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoon-Hanks, Laura L.; Ossiboff, Robert J.; Bartolini, Pia; Fogelson, Susan B.; Perry, Sean M.; St\u00F6hr, Anke C.; Cross, Shaun T.; Wellehan, James F.

Neutrophils, along macrophages, are pivotal in the innate immune-driven liver IRI, whereas the effective neutrophil-targeting therapies remain to be established. In this review, we summarize progress in our appreciation of the neutrophil biology and discuss neutrophil-based therapeutic perspectives. RECENT FINDINGS: New technological advances enable to accurately track neutrophil movements and help to understand molecular mechanisms in neutrophil function, such as selective recruitment to IR-stressed tissue, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, or reverse migration into circulation. In addition to pro-inflammatory and tissue-destructive functions, immune regulatory and tissue-repairing phenotype associated with distinct neutrophil subsets have been identified. SUMMARY: Newly recognized and therapeutically attractive neutrophil characteristics warrant comprehensive preclinical and clinical attention to target IRI in transplant recipients.","publish_time":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nakamura, Kojiro; Kageyama, Shoichi; Kupiec-Weglinski, Jerzy W.","journal":"Curr Transplant Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ea8a929038f3eb19f051a4f39457b3a29a56603.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6786799.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6786799/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neutrophil function","effective neutrophil","neutrophil movements","neutrophil biology","attractive neutrophil characteristics","distinct neutrophil subsets","formation of neutrophil extracellular traps","target IRI","innate immune-driven liver IRI","tissue-destructive functions","IR-stressed tissue","liver transplantation","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","clinical attention","major risk factor","selective recruitment","phenotype","Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury","primary graft dysfunction","New technological advances","reverse migration","transplant recipients","inevitable event","molecular mechanisms","development of acute","RECENT FINDINGS","chronic rejection","macrophages","circulation","addition","appreciation","progress","therapeutic perspectives","Neutrophils","SUMMARY","therapies"],"language":"en"},

Here we introduce and study an adaptive susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model wherein the infection and network coevolve with nontrivial probability to close triangles during edge rewiring, leading to substantial reinforcement of network transitivity. This model provides an opportunity to study the role of transitivity in altering the SIS dynamics on a coevolving network. Using numerical simulations and approximate master equations (AMEs), we identify and examine a rich set of dynamical features in the model. In many cases, AMEs including transitivity reinforcement provide accurate predictions of stationary-state disease prevalence and network degree distributions. Furthermore, for some parameter settings, the AMEs accurately trace the temporal evolution of the system. We show that higher transitivity reinforcement in the model leads to lower levels of infective individuals in the population, when closing a triangle is the dominant rewiring mechanism. These methods and results may be useful in developing ideas and modeling strategies for controlling SIS-type epidemics.","publish_time":"2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Hsuan-Wei; Malik, Nishant; Shi, Feng; Mucha, Peter J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/edbcc04de29555ae173e9760dde3575b2718f950.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6790070.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6790070/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["substantial reinforcement of network transitivity","epidemic model","AMEs","higher transitivity reinforcement","role of transitivity","coevolving networks","SIS dynamics","network degree distributions","SIS-type epidemics","epidemic spread","edge rewiring","adaptive susceptible-infected","dominant rewiring mechanism","central structural feature of social networks","state disease prevalence","accurate predictions of stationary","influence","modeling strategies","nontrivial probability","infection","developing ideas","close triangles","approximate master equations","lower levels of infective individuals","numerical simulations","population","results","rich set of dynamical features","temporal evolution","opportunity","cases","system","methods","parameter settings"],"language":"en"},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from national haemovigilance systems, reactions associated with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and residual risks of transfusion\u2010transmitted infectious diseases were assembled from 17 nations. Country\u2010specific rates of adverse events were pooled using random\u2010effects Poisson regression. RESULTS: Febrile non\u2010haemolytic and delayed serologic transfusion reactions were the most frequent adverse events reported after RBC transfusion, occurring in 26 patients per 100 000 RBC units and 25 patients per 100 000 RBC units administered, respectively. Rates of allergic, febrile non\u2010haemolytic and delayed haemolytic transfusion reactions in the United States were significantly greater than the pooled rates from other countries. Frequencies of adverse events generated from the national haemovigilance programme in the United States were considerably lower than when obtained through active surveillance. CONCLUSION: Haemovigilance reports of adverse events in the United States are comparable to, or greater than, reports from other developed countries. Rates generated from haemovigilance programmes are lower than those obtained through active surveillance. The lack of universal leucoreduction of RBC units may be a contributing factor to the higher rate of some adverse events in the United States.","publish_time":"2015-12-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rogers, M.

Here, we report the structure of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein in complex with its host cell receptor ACE2 revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The complex structure shows that only one receptor-binding domain of the trimeric S glycoprotein binds ACE2 and adopts a protruding \u201Cup\u201D conformation. In addition, we studied the structures of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and its complexes with ACE2 in different in vitro conditions, which may mimic different conformational states of the S glycoprotein during virus entry. Disassociation of the S1-ACE2 complex from some of the prefusion spikes was observed and characterized. We also characterized the rosette-like structures of the clustered SARS-CoV S2 trimers in the postfusion state observed on electron micrographs. Structural comparisons suggested that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein retains a prefusion architecture after trypsin cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits and acidic pH treatment. However, binding to the receptor opens up the receptor-binding domain of S1, which could promote the release of the S1-ACE2 complex and S1 monomers from the prefusion spike and trigger the pre- to postfusion conformational transition.","publish_time":"2018-08-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Wenfei; Gui, Miao; Wang, Xinquan; Xiang, Ye","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0f1b5a380193e6ff0a4de4d44d74ad309a5dda3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6107290.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102747/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007236","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV S glycoprotein","S1-ACE2 complex","trimeric S glycoprotein","receptor-binding domain of S1","S1 monomers","S1-S2 heterodimers","host cell receptor ACE2","clustered SARS-CoV S2 trimers","trimeric SARS coronavirus","complex structure","cellular receptor angiotensin","postfusion conformational transition","postfusion conformation transition","S2 subunits","postfusion state","prefusion architecture","prefusion spikes","structures","cryo-electron microscopy","different conformational states","cellular membranes","surface spike","cryo-EM","electron micrographs","trypsin cleavage","complexes","conditions","acidic pH treatment","enzyme","release","virus entry","protruding","Disassociation","Structural comparisons","rosette","addition"],"language":"en"},

Virus structure, lifestyle, replication strategies, classication, the varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations are focussed upon in the chapter. Viruses are extremely simple \u201Clife\u201D forms without metabolic capacity, organelles, translational machinery, or autonomous replicative potential; the essential elements of a virus are consequently minimal. A virus enters the host through any opportunistic opening of the body\u2014; such as minute breaks in the skin barrier or mucosal linings of the eye, nose, etc. Antibodies produced during an infection often have the ability to bind the virus and reduce infectivity. An immediate question to solve during a virus outbreak is the mechanism by which the virus spreads. Viruses frequently infect animal or insect vectors that serve to pass the virus to humans. By identifying the virus through sequence analysis, a hypothetical reservoir can be predicted by the placement of the sequence on the phylogenetic tree\u2025 The varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations as they relate to the different diagnostic methods for virus identification are highlighted. Examples of naturally emerging viruses; such as Sin Nombre, Nipah, West Nile conclude the chapter. New technologies that allow the creation of manmade or \u201Cengineered\u201D viruses, new frontiers in viral diagnostics, and a few thoughts on the future of virology are also presented. The global eradication of smallpox ranks as one of humankind\u0027s greatest accomplishments yet many viral challenges remain. HIV, hepatitis B and C, influenza, dengue, rotavirus, and many other viral diseases continue to affect tens of millions.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"HIETPAS, JACK; MCMULLAN, LAURA K.; HANSON, HOLLY L.; RICE, CHARLES M.; MINDELL, DAVID P.","journal":"Microbial Forensics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ba1ff6ac446cec26a77242f31869645ebf4c0f5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149634.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978012088483450007X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012088483450007X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus identification","Virus structure","virus outbreak","virus spreads","infection","chapter","viral diagnostics","viral diseases","viral challenges","emerging viruses","viral pathogens","varied modes of transmission","disease manifestations","sequence analysis","new frontiers","future of virology","New technologies","basic concepts of virology","translational machinery","metabolic capacity","autonomous replicative potential","replication strategies","organelles","Sin Nombre","classication","mucosal linings","skin barrier","essential elements","eye","influenza","forms","Nipah","West Nile","rotavirus","lifestyle","phylogenetic tree","humankind\u0027s greatest accomplishments","hepatitis B","minute breaks","different diagnostic methods","body","nose","dengue","Publisher Summary","usage of current technology","hypothetical reservoir","thoughts","mechanism","opportunistic opening","insect vectors","HIV","placement","creation of manmade","Antibodies","animal","host","global eradication of smallpox","tens of millions","immediate question","Examples","ability","infectivity"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A total of 1,184 nasopharyngeal washes were collected from hospitalized patients and sent to the Department of Microbiology, Siriraj Hospital, for influenza A virus detection. Real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect hMPV infection. Partially, F gene from hMPV positive samples were sequenced and used for genotyping by phylogenetic tree analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of hMPV for all age groups was 6.3%. The highest prevalence of hMPV infection was in children aged \u003C2 years. Of 71 hMPV\u2010positive patients, three (4.2%) were coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), two with rhinovirus (2.8%), one with coronavirus (1.4%), and one with RSV and adenovirus (1.4%). Phylogenetic analysis of F gene revealed that 96.8% of hMPV detected was subgenotype B1, 1.6% was sublineage A2a, and 1.6% was A2b. Genetic variation of F gene was much conserved.

This species has demonstrated important biological activities such as antihypertensive and vasodilator, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. However, no studies have been, so far, reported with the fruits of S. terebinthifolius as a protector of the placenta against Zika virus infection and as sunscreen agents. The present study aimed to investigate new uses for the ethanolic fruit extracts of S. terebinthifolius, from fruits\u2019peel (STPE) and from the whole fruits (STWFE). Zika virus (ZIKV) has been linked to several fetal malformations, such as microcephaly and other central nervous system abnormalities. Thus, the potential of these natural extracts against ZIKV infection was evaluated, using an in vitro method. The photoprotective potential, determined by spectrometry, along with phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and chemical composition of both extracts were also evaluated. The chemical composition of the extracts was evaluated by HPLC-UV / vis. The cytotoxicity of peel and whole fruit extracts in vero E6 cell lines, in placental cell lines and placental explant cultures were evaluated by the MTT assay. The infectivity of placental cells and explants was evaluated by qRT-PCR and the effects of extracts on ZIKV infection were investigated using HTR-8/SVneo cells, pre-treated with 100 \u03BCg mL(-1) of STWFE for 1 h, and infected with MR766 (AD) or PE243 (EH) ZIKV strains. STFE and STWFE were well-tolerated by both placental-derived trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo as well as by term placental chorionic villi explants, which indicate absence of cytotoxicity in all analysed concentrations. Two strains of ZIKV were tested to access if pre-treatment of trophoblast cells with the STWFE would protect them against infection. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that STWFE extract greatly reduced ZIKV infection. The extracts were also photoprotective with SPF values equivalent to the standard, benzophenone-3. The formulations prepared in different concentrations of the extracts (5-10%) had shown maximum SPF values of 32.21. STWFE represents a potential natural mixture to be used in pregnancy in order to restrain placental infection by ZIKV and might potentially protect fetus against ZIKV-related malformations. The extracts exhibited photoprotective activity and some of the phenolic compounds, mainly resveratrol, catechin and epicatechin, are active ingredients in all assayed activities. The development of biotechnological/medical products, giving extra value to products from family farming, is expected, with strong prospects for success.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"dos Santos Oliveira, M\u00F4nika Bezerra; Valentim, Iara Barros; dos Santos Rocha, Tauane; Santos, Jaqueline Correia; Nobre Pires, Keyla Silva; Lira Tanabe, Eloiza Lopes; Cruz Borbely, Karen Steponavicius; Borbely, Alexandre Urban; Fonseca Goulart, Mar\u00EDlia Oliveira","journal":"Ind Crops Prod","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d81dfed14616501feaeb0a3e075f5c417905e2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186214.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112503; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926669020304192; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926669020304192?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346222/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. terebinthifolius"],"organizations":["MTT","STFE","ZIKV","STWFE"],"locations":["South America"],"keyphrases":["placental infection","natural extracts","effects of extracts","reduced ZIKV infection","ZIKV strains","strains of ZIKV","ethanolic fruit extracts","placental cell lines","ZIKV-related malformations","STWFE extract","infectivity of placental cells","Zika virus infection","photoprotective potential","placental explant cultures","placental-derived trophoblast cell line HTR","SVneo cells","term placental chorionic villi explants","pre-treatment of trophoblast cells","potential natural mixture","chemical composition","photoprotective activity","vero E6 cell lines","Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi","maximum SPF values","medical products","absence of cytotoxicity","phenolic content","cytotoxicity of peel","phenolic compounds","antioxidant capacity","assayed activities","analysed concentrations","different concentrations","fetal malformations","important biological activities","well-known medicinal plant native of South America","extra value","microcephaly","vasodilator","new uses","active ingredients","protector","pregnancy","family farming","Flow cytometry analysis","MR766","central nervous system abnormalities","epicatechin","resveratrol","qRT-PCR","PE243","spectrometry","sunscreen agents","fetus","order","development of biotechnological","HPLC-UV","present study","species","standard","STFE","STPE","fruits\u2019peel","strong prospects","MTT assay","success","formulations","benzophenone","\u03BCg","studies","method"],"language":"en"},

Work was carried out in 22 sheep farms, with (i) flock size over 150 animals, (ii) presence of clinical signs of diarrhoea in lambs in the flock and (iii) close and continuous contact and movement of shepherd dogs within the animal shed of each farm. Faecal sample collection from lambs was performed within 48h of onset of clinical signs and prior to administration of any antimicrobial or antiparasitic medication to lambs. Faecal samples were also collected from puppies in the farm. In total, samples were collected from 126 lambs and 58 puppies. Samples were processed by using established techniques for isolation of bacteria, detection of viruses and observation of protozoan oocycts. Escherichia coli isolates obtained during the study, were tested for antimicrobial resistance against a variety of antimicrobial agents. In total, 236 bacterial isolates were recovered from faecal samples of lambs and 165 isolates from faecal samples of puppies. E. coli was the most frequently isolated microorganism: 104 isolates from lambs and 109 isolates from puppies were recovered. Other bacteria isolated were Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., (lambs and puppies), Clostridium perfringens, Citrobacter freundi, Salmonella enterica subsp. diarizonae (only lambs) and Streptococcus spp. (only puppies). Group A Rotavirus was detected in samples from lambs (2.5%) and Parvovirus in samples from puppies (5%). Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were observed in samples from lambs and puppies. This is the first report of isolation of S. enterica subsp. diarizonae and of detection of Rotavirus from lambs in Greece. Rates of E. coli isolates from puppies resistant to antimicrobial agents were, in general, smaller than respective rates in isolates from lambs. Two pairs of isolates from the same farm (one from a lamb and one from a puppy) with identical patterns of resistance to antimicrobial agents were detected, which provides some evidence in support of a hypothesis that members of each pair might possibly have been spread from one animal species to the other.","publish_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chatzopoulos, D.

This review summarizes progress and challenges in the repurposing of approved drugs as host-targeted broad-spectrum agents for the treatment of intracellular pathogens. These strategies include targeting both cellular factors required for infection by various viruses, intracellular bacteria, and/or protozoa as well as factors that modulate the host immune response to these microbial infections.

Multifocal air space opacities are a common appearance for hospital-acquired pneumonias, especially for patients in the intensive care setting. Fungal pneumonias should be considered when the chest x-ray is suggestive of pneumonia and cultures for bacterial infection are negative. Immune compromised patients are at high risk for aggressive fungal infections. Multifocal air space opacities are not a common appearance for tuberculosis, but it must be excluded in patients who either present with associated cavities or develop cavities.

In an effort to prevent hospital-acquired Covid-19 infections, most hospitals have severely curtailed elective surgery, performing only surgeries if the patient\u2019s survival or permanent function would be compromised by a delay in surgery. As hospitals emerge from the pandemic, it will be necessary to progressively increase surgical activity at a time when hospitals continue to care for Covid-19 patients. In an attempt to mitigate the risk of nosocomial infection, we have created a patient care pathway designed to minimize risk of exposure of patients coming in to the hospital for scheduled procedures. The \u201CCovid-minimal surgery pathway\u201D is a predetermined patient flow, that dictates the locations, personnel and materials that come in contact with our cancer surgery population, designed to minimize risk for virus transmission. We outline the approach that allowed a large academic medical center to create a Covid-minimal cancer surgery pathway within 7 days of initiating discussions. Although the pathway represents a combination of recommended practices, there is not data to support its efficacy.

Research has shown that the entry into these cells is through porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) receptor. To gain insights into mechanisms of PEDV-pAPN interactions, the present study aimed at identifying the domain that is critical for PEDV binding. To this end, NIH3T3 cell lines constitutively expressing pAPN or pAPN mutants were generated. The mutants were; domain VII deletion mutant and domains IV\u2013VI deletion mutant. In the latter, domain VII was linked to the transmembrane segment through domain III. Results showed PEDV infection was restricted to pAPN and pAPN domain VII expressing NIH3T3 cells. Further, reducing PEDV titre 10 fold resulted in 37.8% decrease in foci indicating positive correlation. A time course test at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60h showed that foci increased 6 fold in the overall time range. Also, PEDV harvested from pAPN or domain VII expressing NIH3T3 cells was induced indirect plaques in Vero cells confirming successful entry and replication. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PEDV recognizes pAPN and that the main interactive point is lodged within domain VII of the pAPN. These findings are important for therapeutic development as well as creating a platform for future studies on PEDV.","publish_time":"2017-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kamau, Anthony Ndirangu; Park, Jung-Eun; Park, Eui-Soon; Yu, Jung-Eun; Rho, Jaerang; Shin, Hyun-Jin","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a6a31668f42377d6790de692902556be690dab6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114530.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.10.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216304725; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216304725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27732876/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","VII"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pAPN domain","pAPN mutants","pAPN interactions","mechanisms of PEDV","PEDV infection","PEDV binding","PEDV titre","NIH3T3 cells","Vero cells","swine intestinal cells","deletion mutant","fold","foci","Results","NIH3T3 cell lines","successful entry","porcine aminopeptidase N","overall time range","time course test","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","indirect plaques","domains IV","present study","main interactive point","enteric disease","platform","replication","receptor","therapeutic development","findings","end","future studies","insights","transmembrane segment","positive correlation","Research"],"language":"en"},

Histological changes, blood gases, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and wet-to-dry weight were analyzed to evaluate lung injury after smoke inhalation; beside, we also measured the expression of ACE and ACE2 at different time points to explore the possible mechanism of those changes. The results showed that pH of arterial blood, partial blood oxygen (PaO2) and blood oxygen saturation (SO2) decreased after smoke inhalation at different time points (P \u003C0.01); while, partial blood carbon dioxide (PaCO2), wet-to-dry weight ratio, leukocytes count, protein concentration and inflammatory cytokines in BALF increased after smoke exposure (P \u003C0.01).

However, the contribution between peripheral and CNS activation remains unclear. During gliatropic coronavirus induced encephalomyelitis, accumulation of protective antibody secreting cells is preceded by infiltration of B cells with a na\u00EFve and early differentiation phenotype (Phares et al., 2014). Investigation of the temporal dynamics of B cell activation in draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and the CNS revealed that peak CNS infiltration of early activated, unswitched IgD(\u002B) and IgM(\u002B) B cells coincided with polyclonal activation in CLN. By contrast, isotype-switched IgG(\u002B) B cells did not accumulate until peripheral germinal center formation. In the CNS, unswitched B cells were confined to the perivascular space and meninges, with only rare B cell clusters, while isotype-switched B cells localized to parenchymal areas. Although ectopic follicle formation was not observed, more differentiated B cell subsets within the CNS expressed the germinal center marker GL7, albeit at lower levels than CLN counterparts. During chronic infection, CNS IgD(int) and IgD(\u2212) B cell subsets further displayed sustained markers of proliferation and CD4 T cell help, which were only transiently expressed in the CLN. A contribution of local CD4 T cell help to sustain B cell activation was supported by occasional B cells adjacent to T cells. The results suggest that accumulation of differentiated B cell subsets within the CNS is largely dictated by peripheral activation, but that local events contribute to their sustained activation independent of ectopic follicle formation.","publish_time":"2017-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"DiSano, Krista D.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.","journal":"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de9587b07c5f44211f82f001b9a0182a1375ed81.json; document_parses/pdf_json/418394d810d96acb7e6244b958d64c77818cb501.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5215090.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27658544/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5215090?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159116304317; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159116304317; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2016.09.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","CLN","CNS IgD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["accumulation of B cells","infiltration of B cells","unswitched B cells","occasional B cells","CNS activation","T cells","accumulation of differentiated B cell subsets","temporal dynamics of B cell activation","rare B cell clusters","CNS IgD","peripheral activation","CD4 T cell help","polyclonal activation","contribution of local CD4 T cell","accumulation of protective antibody secreting cells","peak CNS infiltration of early activated","sustained activation independent of ectopic follicle formation","unswitched IgD","peripheral germinal center formation","CLN counterparts","isotype","early differentiation phenotype","viral infection","local events","germinal center marker GL7","chronic infection","sustained markers of proliferation","autoimmune disease results","various differentiation stages","inflammation","cervical lymph nodes","gliatropic coronavirus induced encephalomyelitis","lower levels","meninges","int","Phares","Central nervous system","perivascular space","IgG","IgM","Investigation","parenchymal areas","contrast"],"language":"en"},

This chapter covers the effects of exercise (acute and chronic), both positive and negative, on immune function and consequent infection risk, and considers the current state-of-the-art for monitoring and assessing this in athletes.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jones, Arwel Wyn; Davison, Glen","journal":"Muscle and Exercise Physiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9cbb6b18a54cdc9f861d08e5a1b1be66dee6fe01.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149380.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128145937000153; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128145937000153","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune function","effects of exercise","periods of exercise","risk of infection","URT infections","athletes","immune system functions","moderate amounts of exercise","consequent infection risk","intensive training","incidence of minor infections","induced changes","upper respiratory tract","monitoring","physiological adaptations","influenza","performance","times","chapter","competition"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS from 14 hospitals in Saudi Arabia diagnosed between September 2012 and January 2018. We evaluated the association of RBV/rIFN with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA clearance using marginal structural modeling to account for baseline and time-varying confounders. RESULTS: Of 349 MERS patients, 144 (41.3%) patients received RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-\u03B12a, rIFN-\u03B12b, or rIFN-\u03B21a; none received rIFN-\u03B21b). RBV/rIFN was initiated at a median of 2 days (Q1, Q3: 1, 3 days) from intensive care unit admission. Crude 90-day mortality was higher in patients with RBV/rIFN compared to no RBV/rIFN (106/144 [73.6%] vs 126/205 [61.5%]; P = .02]. After adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders using a marginal structural model, RBV/rIFN was not associated with changes in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .73\u20131.44]; P = .87) or with more rapid MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65 [95% CI, .30\u20131.44]; P = .29). CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study, RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-\u03B12a, rIFN-\u03B12b, or rIFN-\u03B21a) therapy was commonly used in critically ill MERS patients but was not associated with reduction in 90-day mortality or in faster MERS-CoV RNA clearance.","publish_time":"2019-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arabi, Yaseen M; Shalhoub, Sarah; Mandourah, Yasser; Al-Hameed, Fahad; Al-Omari, Awad; Al Qasim, Eman; Jose, Jesna; Alraddadi, Basem; Almotairi, Abdullah; Al Khatib, Kasim; Abdulmomen, Ahmed; Qushmaq, Ismael; Sindi, Anees A; Mady, Ahmed; Solaiman, Othman; Al-Raddadi, Rajaa; Maghrabi, Khalid; Ragab, Ahmed; Al Mekhlafi, Ghaleb A; Balkhy, Hanan H; Al Harthy, Abdulrahman; Kharaba, Ayman; Gramish, Jawaher A; Al-Aithan, Abdulsalam M; Al-Dawood, Abdulaziz; Merson, Laura; Hayden, Frederick G; Fowler, Robert","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7217d2270fe8b796b95545af6cbe6001cf6f1836.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108209.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciz544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31925415/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBV","MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["rIFN-\u03B12b","rIFN-\u03B12a","rIFN-\u03B21a","rIFN-\u03B21b","ill MERS patients","association of RBV","MERS coronavirus","ill patients","day mortality","faster MERS-CoV RNA clearance","rapid MERS-CoV RNA clearance","time-varying confounders","baseline","days","observational study","therapy","marginal structural modeling","adjusted hazard ratio","adjusted odds ratio","retrospective cohort study","Middle East respiratory syndrome","accounting","recombinant interferon","outcomes","laboratory","intensive care unit admission","Q1","Q3","effect of ribavirin","hospitals","Saudi Arabia","Crude","median","reduction","changes","confidence interval","METHODS","BACKGROUND","objective","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","vs"],"language":"en"},

Eukaryotic viruses generally modify the 5\u2032-end of their RNAs to mimic the cellular mRNA structure, thereby facilitating viral replication in host cells. However, the molecular organization and biochemical mechanisms of the viral capping apparatus typically differ from its cellular counterpart, which makes viral capping enzymes attractive targets for drug discovery. Our previous work showed that SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) non-structural protein 14 represents a structurally novel and unique guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) that is able to functionally complement yeast cellular N7-MTase. In the present study, we developed a yeast-based system for identifying and screening inhibitors against coronavirus N7-MTase using both 96-well and 384-well microtiter plates. The MTase inhibitors previously identified by in vitro biochemical assays were tested, and some, such as sinefungin, effectively suppressed N7-MTase in the yeast system. However, other compounds, such as ATA and AdoHcy, did not exert an inhibitory effect within a cellular context. These results validated the yeast assay system for inhibitor screening yet also demonstrated the difference between cell-based and in vitro biochemical assays. The yeast system was applied to the screening of 3000 natural product extracts, and three were observed to more potently inhibit the activity of coronavirus than human N7-MTase.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Ying; Wang, Zidao; Tao, Jiali; Wang, Yi; Wu, Andong; Yang, Ziwen; Wang, Kaimei; Shi, Liqiao; Chen, Yu; Guo, Deyin","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/915788ebeda17fe0f3f6dc5a7ef7d31343dba162.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119097.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24530452/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214000369; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214000369; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.02.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","ATA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["yeast cellular N7-MTase","coronavirus N7-MTase","yeast system","human N7-MTase","suppressed N7-MTase","MTase inhibitors","yeast-based system","yeast assay system","unique guanine-N7","cellular mRNA structure","SARS coronavirus","screening inhibitors","cellular counterpart","cellular context","biochemical assays","viral capping apparatus","viral replication","inhibitor screening","biochemical mechanisms","activity of coronavirus","non-self mRNA","viral capping enzymes attractive targets","protein translation","distinction of self","SARS-CoV","non-structural protein","molecular signature","cap structure","molecular organization","Eukaryotic viruses","distinct feature of eukaryotic mRNAs","RNA stability","drug discovery","methyltransferase","inhibitory effect","previous work","AdoHcy","natural product extracts","host cells","difference","results","sinefungin","compounds","ATA","present study","microtiter plates","end"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, details of the transmission cycle of the virus remain unclear, particularly regarding the role of camels as a reservoir host for human infections. METHODS: We present a first analysis of the environmental circumstances under which MERS-CoV cases have occurred in the Middle East, covering all case occurrences through May 2015, using ecological niche modeling approaches to map transmission risk. We compare the environmental breadth of conditions under which cases have reported camel contacts with that of the broader population of all cases, to assess whether camel-associated cases occur under a more restricted set of environmental circumstances. RESULTS: We documented geographic and environmental distributions of MERS-CoV cases across the Middle East, and offer preliminary mapping of transmission risk. We confirm the idea that climatic dimensions of camel-associated cases are more constrained and less variable than the broader suite of case occurrences; hence, camel exposure may be a key limiting element in MERS-CoV transmission. CONCLUSION: This study offers a first detailed geographic and environmental analysis of MERS-CoV distributions across the Middle East. Results indicated that camel-exposed cases occur under a narrower suite of environmental conditions than non-camel-exposed cases, suggesting perhaps a key role for camels in the transmission of the disease, and perhaps a narrower area of risk for \u2018primary,\u2019 camel-derived cases of MERS.","publish_time":"2015-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reeves, Tarian; Samy, Abdallah M.; Peterson, A.

With k(cat)/K(M) of 602,000 M(\u22121) s(\u22121), PLpro hydrolyzes ISG15-AMC 30- and 60-fold more efficiently than Ub-AMC and Nedd8-AMC, respectively.

It is extremely important to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gansu (China), with a questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ). A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score. A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression. The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses. The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the total score of positive coping was negatively correlated with the total score of anxiety (r=-0.182, p=0.002) and depression (r=-0.253, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping styles will help to improve their negative emotions.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Juhong; Sun, Lin; Zhang, Lan; Wang, Huan; Fan, Ajiao; Yang, Bin; Li, Wei; Xiao, Shifu","journal":"Front Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27eb3449e1450d9a4b12851aa9e091aeb5d21378.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202136.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32411034/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCSQ","SAS","SDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["anxiety symptoms","depression symptoms","History of depression","factors of anxiety","high anxiety","total score of anxiety","prevalence rates of anxiety","prevalence rate of anxiety","self-rating anxiety scale","self-rating depression scale","total score of positive coping","doctors","nurses","positive coping styles","SCSQ score","line anti-epidemic medical staff","Chinese medical staff","SAS","SDS","common risk factor","simplified coping style questionnaire","protective factor","influencing factors","negative emotions","results of partial correlation analysis","questionnaire packet","cross-sectional survey","psychological pressure","gender","COVID","outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia","China","BACKGROUND","Gansu","relationship","linear regression model","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Luteolin and apigenin are two main bioactive components in Flos Chrysanthemi, and chrysoeriol and diosmetin are two methylated metabolites of luteolin in vivo by cathechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). However, there was lack of pharmacokinetic information of chrysoeriol and diosmetin after oral administration of Flos Chrysanthemi extract (FCE). The present study aimed to develop an HPLC-UV method for simultaneous determination of rat plasma concentration of luteolin, apigenin, chrysoeriol and diosmetin and utilize it in pharmacokinetic study of the four compounds after orally giving FCE to rats. The method was successfully validated and applied to the pharmacokinetic study when oral administration of FCE to rats with or without co-giving a COMT inhibitor, entacapone. Chrysoeriol and diosmetin were detected in rat plasma after oral administration of FCE and their concentrations were significantly decreased after co-giving entacapone. Furthermore, AUC of luteolin was significantly increased by entacapone, while that of chrysoeriol was decreased by entacapone, which revealed COMT might play an important role in the disposition of luteolin in rats after dosing of FCE. In conclusion, a sensitive, accurate and reproducible HPLC-UV method for simultaneous determination of luteolin, apigenin, chrysoeriol and diosmetin in rat plasma were developed, pharmacokinetics of chrysoeriol and diosmetin combined with luteolin and apigenin were characterized after oral administration of FCE to rats, which gave us more information on pharmacokinetics and potential pharmacological effects of FCE in vivo.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Zhongjian; Kong, Sisi; Song, Feifeng; Li, Liping; Jiang, Huidi","journal":"Fitoterapia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb123ebe33919de898e3d9b8f22dc3fc913281c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127355.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2012.09.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999990/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0367326X12002584; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0367326X12002584","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Flos Chrysanthemi"],"organizations":["FCE","COMT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["diosmetin","oral administration of FCE","pharmacokinetics of chrysoeriol","disposition of luteolin","apigenin","AUC of luteolin","dosing of FCE","rats","simultaneous determination of luteolin","lack of pharmacokinetic information of chrysoeriol","simultaneous determination of rat plasma concentration of luteolin","oral administration of Flos Chrysanthemi extract","methylated metabolites of luteolin","pharmacokinetic study","co-giving entacapone","potential pharmacological effects of FCE","Abstract Flos Chrysanthemi","reproducible HPLC-UV method","COMT inhibitor","present study","main bioactive components","cathechol-O","traditional Chinese medicine","concentrations","flower of Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat","food","important role","compounds","China","diseases","methyltransferase","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to detect 15 common respiratory viruses in children under 15 years of age who were hospitalized with ARI between January 2013 and December 2015. Viral epidemiology and clinical profiles of single virus infections were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 3,505 patients, viruses were identified in 2,424 (69.1%), with the assay revealing a single virus in 1,747 cases (49.8%). While major pathogens in single virus-positive cases differed according to age, human rhinovirus (hRV) was common in patients of all ages. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IF), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) were found to be seasonal pathogens, appearing from fall through winter and spring, whereas hRV and adenovirus (AdV) were detected in every season. Patients with ARIs caused by RSV and hRV were frequently afebrile and more commonly had wheezing compared with patients with other viral ARIs. Neutrophil-dominant inflammation was observed in ARIs caused by IF, AdV, and hRV, whereas lymphocyte-dominant inflammation was observed with RSV A, parainfluenza virus, and hMPV. Monocytosis was common with RSV and AdV, whereas eosinophilia was observed with hRV. CONCLUSION: In combination with viral identification, recognition of virus-specific clinical and laboratory patterns will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral ARIs and help us to establish more efficient therapeutic and preventive strategies.","publish_time":"2018-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Eunjin; Ha, Kee-Soo; Song, Dae Jin; Lee, Jung Hwa; Lee, Kwang Chul","journal":"Korean J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0464b088c3c7a939a2f1862f7e910ffd9340eeb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6021362.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3345/kjp.2018.61.6.180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29963101/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hRV","causative virus","recognition of virus","parainfluenza virus","Respiratory syncytial virus","RSV","patients","epidemiology of viral ARIs","single virus-positive cases","clinical profiles of single virus infections","viral identification","common respiratory viruses","Viral epidemiology","AdV","acute respiratory infections","asymptomatic children","hMPV","lymphocyte-dominant inflammation","Neutrophil-dominant inflammation","major pathogens","years of age","human rhinovirus","seasonal pathogens","human metapneumovirus","availability of molecular methods","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays","laboratory patterns","understanding","fall","spring","combination","winter","preventive strategies","CONCLUSION","adenovirus","Monocytosis","eosinophilia","PURPOSE","RESULTS","ages"],"language":"en"},

We could not clearly identify any specific cause of AFOP, such as drug toxicity or infection. Lung transplantation can be complicated by lung injury with an AFOP pattern on histopathologic examination of lung biopsy specimens. The presence of an AFOP pattern was associated with irreversible decline in lung function that was refractory to therapeutic interventions in 5 of our 6 cases and was associated with severe allograft dysfunction and death in these 5 individuals.

Extract of Rhodiola rosea displayed specific and potent inhibition against cell entry of both Ebola virus and Marburg virus. In addition, twenty commercial compounds that were isolated from Rhodiola rosea were evaluated using the pseudotyped Ebola virus entry assay, and it was found that ellagic acid and gallic acid, which are two structurally related compounds, are the most effective ones. The activity of the extract and the two pure compounds were validated using infectious Ebola virus. The time-of-addition experiments suggest that, mechanistically, the Rhodiola rosea extract and the effective compounds act at an early step in the infection cycle following initial cell attachment, but prior to viral/cell membrane fusion.

The situation in Germany is shaped by two partly competing suggestions of how to regulate security-related research: The German Ethics Council, as an independent political advisory body, recommended a series of measures, including national legislation on DURC. Competing with that, the German National Academy of Sciences and the German Research Foundation, as two major professional bodies, presented a strategy which draws on the self-control of science and, inter alia, suggests expanding the scope of research ethics committees (RECs) to an evaluation of DURC. MAIN BODY: This situation is taken as an occasion to further discuss the scope and limits of professional self-control with respect to security-related research. The role of RECs as professional bodies of science is particularly analyzed, referring to the theoretical backgrounds of professionalism. Two key sociological features of professionalism \u2013 ethical orientation and professional self-control \u2013 are discussed with respect to the practice of biomedical science. Both attributes are then analyzed with respect to the assessment of DURC by RECs.

It is becoming apparent, however, that severe neurological sequelae, such as Guillian-Barr\u00EB syndrome (GBS), myelitis, encephalitis, and seizures can occur after infection of adults. This study demonstrates that a contemporary strain of ZIKV can widely infect astrocytes and neurons in the brain and spinal cord of adult, interferon \u03B1/\u03B2 receptor knockout mice (AG129 strain) and cause progressive hindlimb paralysis, as well as severe seizure-like activity during the acute phase of disease. The severity of hindlimb motor deficits correlated with increased numbers of ZIKV-infected lumbosacral spinal motor neurons and decreased numbers of spinal motor neurons. Electrophysiological compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes in response to stimulation of the lumbosacral spinal cord were reduced when obvious motor deficits were present. ZIKV immunoreactivity was high, intense, and obvious in tissue sections of the brain and spinal cord. Infection in the brain and spinal cord was also associated with astrogliosis as well as T cell and neutrophil infiltration. CMAP and histological analysis indicated that peripheral nerve and muscle functions were intact. Consequently, motor deficits in these circumstances appear to be primarily due to myelitis and possibly encephalitis as opposed to a peripheral neuropathy or a GBS-like syndrome. Thus, acute ZIKV infection of adult AG129 mice may be a useful model for ZIKV-induced myelitis, encephalitis, and seizure activity.

AMR already causes 700,000 deaths/year. It is estimated that 10 million deaths due to AMR will occur every year after 2050. This equals the number of people dying of cancer every year in present times. International institutions such as G20, World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), UN General Assembly, European Union, and the UK and USA governments are calling for new antibiotics. To underline this emergency, a list of antibiotic-resistant \u201Cpriority pathogens\u201D has been published by WHO. It contains 12 families of bacteria that represent the greatest danger for human health. Resistance to multiple antibiotics is particularly relevant for the Gram-negative bacteria present in the list. The ability of these bacteria to develop mechanisms to resist treatment could be transmitted with genetic material, allowing other bacteria to become drug resistant. Although the search for new antimicrobial drugs remains a top priority, the pipeline for new antibiotics is not promising, and alternative solutions are needed. A possible answer to AMR is vaccination. In fact, while antibiotic resistance emerges rapidly, vaccines can lead to a much longer lasting control of infections. New technologies, such as the high-throughput cloning of human B cells from convalescent or vaccinated people, allow for finding new protective antigens (Ags) that could not be identified with conventional technologies. Antibodies produced by convalescent B cell clones can be screened for their ability to bind, block, and kill bacteria, using novel high-throughput microscopy platforms that rapidly capture digital images, or by conventional technologies such as bactericidal, opsono-phagocytosis and FACS assays. Selected antibodies expressed by recombinant DNA techniques can be used for passive immunization in animal models and tested for protection. Antibodies providing the best protection can be employed to identify new Ags and then used for generating highly specific recombinant Fab fragments. Co-crystallization of Ags bound to Fab fragments will allow us to determine the structure and characteristics of new Ags. This structure-based Ag design will bring to a new generation of vaccines able to target previously elusive infections, thereby offering an effective solution to the problem of AMR.","publish_time":"2018-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tagliabue, Aldo; Rappuoli, Rino","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/13bc396fab607d24e0dfd5b38704463d13a85c08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5992407.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5992407/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMR","World Bank","World Health Organization","UN General Assembly, European Union","UK","FACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new antibiotics","New technologies","characteristics of new Ags","new antimicrobial drugs","new protective antigens","human health","new generation of vaccines able","families of bacteria","problem of AMR","year","Gram-negative bacteria present","antibiotic resistance","conventional technologies","Antimicrobial resistance","World Health Organization","list of antibiotic","Selected antibodies","multiple antibiotics","Co-crystallization of Ags","ability","deaths","high-throughput cloning of human B cells","specific recombinant Fab fragments","World Bank","convalescent B cell clones","vaccinated people","priority pathogens","elusive infections","number of people","present times","drug resistant","best protection","novel high-throughput microscopy platforms","recombinant DNA techniques","lasting control of infections","structure-based Ag design","G20","digital images","opsono-phagocytosis","cancer","European Union","passive immunization","effective solution","USA governments","greatest danger","UK","animal models","treatment","General Assembly","FACS assays","International institutions","alarming issue","possible answer","vaccination","genetic material","mechanisms","search","pipeline","emergency","fact","block","alternative solutions"],"language":"en"},

We investigated AstVs circulation in bats in Mozambique and Mayotte, a small island in the Comoros Archipelago located between east Africa and Madagascar. Biological material was collected from 338 bats and tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene with a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. None of the 79 samples obtained from Mayotte bats (Pteropus seychellensis comorensis and Chaerephon pusillus) tested positive; however, 20.1% of bats sampled in Mozambique shed AstVs at the time of sampling and significant interspecific variation in the proportion of positive bats was detected. Many AstVs sequences obtained from a given bat species clustered in different phylogenetic lineages, while others seem to reflect some level of host-virus association, but also with AstVs previously reported from Malagasy bats. Our findings support active circulation of a large diversity of AstVs in bats in the western Indian Ocean islands, including the southeastern African coast, and highlight the need for more detailed assessment of its risk of zoonotic transmission to human populations.

EBV also infects epithelial cells, predominantly resulting in a lytic infection, which may contribute to EBV transmission from saliva. In the nasopharynx, EBV infection can lead to the clonal expansion of a latently infected cell and the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The mechanisms governing EBV pathogenesis in nasopharyngeal epithelium are largely unknown. An advanced understanding would depend on a physiologically relevant culture model of polarized airway epithelium. The recent application of the organotypic raft culture in keratinocytes has demonstrated great promise for the use of polarized cultures in the study of EBV permissive replication. In this study, the adaptation of an air-liquid interface (ALI) culture method using transwell membranes was explored in an EBV-infected NPC cell line. In the EBV-infected NPC HK1 cell line, ALI culture resulted in the completion of EBV reactivation, with global induction of the lytic cascade, replication of EBV genomes, and production of infectious progeny virus. We propose that the ALI culture method can be widely adopted as a physiologically relevant model to study EBV pathogenesis in polarized nasal epithelial cells. IMPORTANCE Lifting adherent cells to the air-liquid interface (ALI) is a method conventionally used to culture airway epithelial cells into polarized apical and basolateral surfaces. Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from monolayer epithelial cultures is sometimes abortive, which may be attributed to the lack of authentic reactivation triggers that occur in stratified epithelium in vivo. In the present work, the ALI culture method was applied to study EBV reactivation in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. The ALI culture of an EBV-infected cell line yielded high titers and can be dissected by a variety of molecular virology assays that measure induction of the EBV lytic cascade and EBV genome replication and assembly. EBV infection of polarized cultures of primary epithelial cells can be challenging and can have variable efficiencies. However, the use of the ALI method with established EBV-infected cell lines offers a readily available and reproducible approach for the study of EBV permissive replication in polarized epithelia.","publish_time":"2018-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caves, Elizabeth A.; Cook, Sarah A.; Lee, Nara; Stoltz, Donna; Watkins, Simon; Shair, Kathy H.

However, the mechanisms through which the brain\u2019s immune system recognizes and controls viral infections propagating across synaptically linked neuronal circuits have remained unclear. Using a well-established model of alphaherpesvirus infection that reaches the brain exclusively via retrograde transsynaptic spread from the periphery, and in vivo two-photon imaging combined with high resolution microscopy, we show that microglia are recruited to and isolate infected neurons within hours. Selective elimination of microglia results in a marked increase in the spread of infection and egress of viral particles into the brain parenchyma, which are associated with diverse neurological symptoms. Microglia recruitment and clearance of infected cells require cell-autonomous P2Y12 signalling in microglia, triggered by nucleotides released from affected neurons. In turn, we identify microglia as key contributors to monocyte recruitment into the inflamed brain, which process is largely independent of P2Y12. P2Y12-positive microglia are also recruited to infected neurons in the human brain during viral encephalitis and both microglial responses and leukocyte numbers correlate with the severity of infection. Thus, our data identify a key role for microglial P2Y12 in defence against neurotropic viruses, whilst P2Y12-independent actions of microglia may contribute to neuroinflammation by facilitating monocyte recruitment to the sites of infection.

Recently, owing to growing realization that process-oriented models are useful for ecological forecasts only if the biological processes are well defined, attention has focused on data assimilation as a means to improve the predictive performance of these models. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report on the development of an analytical framework to quantify the relative values of various longitudinal infection surveillance data collected in field sites undergoing mass drug administrations (MDAs) for calibrating three lymphatic filariasis (LF) models (EPIFIL, LYMFASIM, and TRANSFIL), and for improving their predictions of the required durations of drug interventions to achieve parasite elimination in endemic populations. The relative information contribution of site-specific data collected at the time points proposed by the WHO monitoring framework was evaluated using model-data updating procedures, and via calculations of the Shannon information index and weighted variances from the probability distributions of the estimated timelines to parasite extinction made by each model. Results show that data-informed models provided more precise forecasts of elimination timelines in each site compared to model-only simulations. Data streams that included year 5 post-MDA microfilariae (mf) survey data, however, reduced each model\u2019s uncertainty most compared to data streams containing only baseline and/or post-MDA 3 or longer-term mf survey data irrespective of MDA coverage, suggesting that data up to this monitoring point may be optimal for informing the present LF models. We show that the improvements observed in the predictive performance of the best data-informed models may be a function of temporal changes in inter-parameter interactions. Such best data-informed models may also produce more accurate predictions of the durations of drug interventions required to achieve parasite elimination. SIGNIFICANCE: Knowledge of relative information contributions of model only versus data-informed models is valuable for improving the usefulness of LF model predictions in management decision making, learning system dynamics, and for supporting the design of parasite monitoring programmes. The present results further pinpoint the crucial need for longitudinal infection surveillance data for enhancing the precision and accuracy of model predictions of the intervention durations required to achieve parasite elimination in an endemic location.","publish_time":"2018-10-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Michael, Edwin; Sharma, Swarnali; Smith, Morgan E.; Touloupou, Panayiota; Giardina, Federica; Prada, Joaquin M.; Stolk, Wilma A.; Hollingsworth, Deirdre; de Vlas, Sake J.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9abc1a92424ffc51803613392c22320da59ebfb1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6175292.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6175292/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["model-data","Data streams","data assimilation","best data-informed models","parasite elimination","Mathematical models","longer-term mf survey data","present LF models","relative information contribution of site-specific data","accuracy of model predictions","process-oriented models","relative values of various longitudinal infection surveillance data","usefulness of LF model predictions","parasite extinction","Knowledge of relative information contributions of model","required durations of drug interventions","precise forecasts of elimination timelines","accurate predictions","design of parasite monitoring programmes","elimination of parasitic diseases","post-MDA microfilariae","MDA coverage","intervention durations","predictive performance","present results","monitoring point","mass drug administrations","Shannon information index","ecological forecasts","estimated timelines","analytical framework","endemic populations","endemic location","field sites","management decision making","crucial need","weighted variances","MDAs","probability distributions","year","precision","function of temporal changes","biological processes","attention","EPIFIL","calculations","inter-parameter interactions","system dynamics","lymphatic filariasis","control","SIGNIFICANCE","LYMFASIM","means","baseline","time points","model\u2019s uncertainty","development","realization","procedures","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","METHODOLOGY","TRANSFIL","improvements","simulations","BACKGROUND","strategies"],"language":"en"},

We used bibliometric analysis and word cluster analysis to evaluate sanitation research from 1992 to 2016 based on the Science Citation Index EXPANDED (SCI-EXPANDED) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) databases. Our results show that sanitation is a comprehensive field connected with multiple categories, and the increasing number of publications reflects a strong interest in this research area. Most of the research took place in developed countries, especially the USA, although sanitation problems are more serious in developing countries. Innovations in sanitation techniques may keep susceptible populations from contracting diseases caused by various kinds of contaminants and microorganisms. Hence, the hygienization of human excreta, resource recovery, and removal of micro-pollutants from excreta can serve as effective sustainable solutions. Commercialized technologies, like composting, anaerobic digestion, and storage, are reliable but still face challenges in addressing the links between the political, social, institutional, cultural, and educational aspects of sanitation. Innovative technologies, such as Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs), Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs), and struvite precipitation, are at the TRL (Technology readiness levels) 8 level, meaning that they qualify as \u201Cactual systems completed and qualified through test and demonstration.\u201D Solutions that take into consideration economic feasibility and all the different aspects of sanitation are required.

A subset of HPVs, especially HPV16 and 18, are the primary etiological cause for several epithelial cell malignancies, causing about 5.2% of all cancers worldwide. Due to the high prevalence and mortality, HPV-associated cancers have remained as a significant health problem in human society, making an urgent need to develop an effective therapeutic vaccine against them. Achieving this goal is primarily dependent on the identification of efficient tumor-associated epitopes, inducing a robust cell-mediated immune response. Previous information has shown that E5, E6, and E7 early proteins are responsible for the induction and maintenance of HPV-associated cancers. Therefore, the prediction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I T cell epitopes of HPV16, 18, 31 and 45 oncoproteins was targeted in this study. For this purpose, a two-step plan was designed to identify the most probable CD8\u002B T cell epitopes. In the first step, MHC-I and II binding, MHC-I processing, MHC-I population coverage and MHC-I immunogenicity prediction analyses, and in the second step, MHC-I and II protein-peptide docking, epitope conservation, and cross-reactivity with host antigens\u2019 analyses were carried out successively by different tools. Finally, we introduced five probable CD8\u002B T cell epitopes for each oncoprotein of the HPV genotypes (60 epitopes in total), which obtained better scores by an integrated approach. These predicted epitopes are valuable candidates for in vitro or in vivo therapeutic vaccine studies against the HPV-associated cancers. Additionally, this two-step plan that each step includes several analyses to find appropriate epitopes provides a rational basis for DNA- or peptide-based vaccine development.","publish_time":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Panahi, Heidar Ali; Bolhassani, Azam; Javadi, Gholamreza; Noormohammadi, Zahra","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb99b6dde050807939930f078e0eed8a4693a710.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6200245.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6200245/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHC","T cell epitopes of HPV16","appropriate epitopes","predicted epitopes","HPV-associated cancers","robust cell","identification of efficient tumor-associated epitopes","maintenance of HPV","HPV genotypes","epithelial cell malignancies","immunogenicity prediction analyses","therapeutic vaccine studies","effective therapeutic vaccine","probable CD8","two-step plan","peptide-based vaccine development","host antigens\u2019 analyses","human society","Human papillomaviruses","subset of HPVs","protein-peptide docking","prediction of major histocompatibility complex","group of circular double-stranded DNA viruses","class","cross-reactivity","severe tropism","epitope conservation","induction","urgent need","E7 early proteins","E5","E6","primary etiological cause","significant health problem","total","rational basis","mortality","valuable candidates","population coverage","better scores","mucosal tissues","high prevalence","integrated approach","immune response","Previous information","goal","oncoproteins","purpose","binding","different tools","study"],"language":"en"},

RVI have been associated with increased length of hospital stay, severe disease course, unnecessary antimicrobial exposure and nosocomial outbreaks in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Virus transmission has been described to occur via health care professionals, parents and other visitors. Most at risk are infants born prematurely, due to their immature immune system and the fact that they stay in the NICU for a considerable length of time. A prevalence of RVIs in the NICU in symptomatic infants of 6\u201330% has been described, although RVIs are most probably underdiagnosed, since testing for viral pathogens is not performed routinely in symptomatic patients in many NICUs. Additional challenges are the wide range of clinical presentation of RVIs, their similarity to bacterial infections and the unreliable detection methods prior to the era of molecular biology based technologies. In this review, current knowledge of early-life RVI in the NICU is discussed. Reviewed viral pathogens include human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus, and discussed literature is restricted to reports based on modern molecular biology techniques.

Recent studies of viral transmission have used genome sequence data to evaluate the number of particles transmitted between hosts, and the role of selection as it operates during the transmission process. However, the interpretation of sequence data describing transmission events is a challenging task. We here present a novel and comprehensive framework for using short-read sequence data to understand viral transmission events, designed for influenza virus, but adaptable to other viral species. Our approach solves multiple shortcomings of previous methods for this purpose; for example, we consider transmission as an event involving whole viruses, rather than sets of independent alleles. We demonstrate how selection during transmission and noisy sequence data may each affect naive inferences of the population bottleneck, accounting for these in our framework so as to achieve a correct inference. We identify circumstances in which selection for increased viral transmission may or may not be identified from data. Applying our method to experimental data in which transmission occurs in the presence of strong selection, we show that our framework grants a more quantitative insight into transmission events than previous approaches, inferring the bottleneck in a manner that accounts for selection, both for within-host virulence, and for inherent viral transmissibility. Our work provides new opportunities for studying transmission processes in influenza, and by extension, in other infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2018-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lumby, Casper K.; Nene, Nuno R.; Illingworth, Christopher J.

While the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza is substantial each year, the timing and magnitude of epidemics are highly variable which complicates efforts to anticipate demands on the healthcare system. Better methods to forecast influenza activity would help policymakers anticipate such stressors. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recognized the importance of improving influenza forecasting and hosts an annual challenge for predicting influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in the USA. The CDC data serve as the reference for ILI in the USA, but this information is aggregated by epidemiological week and reported after a one-week delay (and may be subject to correction even after this reporting lag). Therefore, there has been substantial interest in whether real-time Internet search data, such as Google, Twitter or Wikipedia could be used to improve influenza forecasting. In this study, we combine a previously developed calibration and prediction framework with an established humidity-based transmission dynamic model to forecast influenza. We then compare predictions based on only CDC ILI data with predictions that leverage the earlier availability and finer temporal resolution of Wikipedia search data. We find that both the earlier availability and the finer temporal resolution are important for increasing forecasting performance. Using daily Wikipedia search data leads to a marked improvement in prediction performance compared to weekly data especially for a three- to four-week forecasting horizon.","publish_time":"2018-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zimmer, Christoph; Leuba, Sequoia I.; Yaesoubi, Reza; Cohen, Ted","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2566b352be16a9322c2f9f2f4086cb7e5ebecec.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d57a6568069375aeca30e1bef1661d308b5cfeba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6228485.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6228485/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA","CDC","Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza forecasting","CDC data","influenza activity","CDC ILI data","weekly data","finer temporal resolution of Wikipedia search data","daily Wikipedia search data leads","real-time Internet search data","increasing forecasting performance","Seasonal influenza causes millions of illnesses","prediction performance","earlier availability","year","predictions","epidemiological week","week delay","prediction framework","established humidity-based transmission dynamic model","marked improvement","tens of thousands","Disease Control","Prevention","deaths","Google","annual challenge","demands","efforts","US Centers","magnitude of epidemics","developed calibration","timing","reference","correction","information","mortality","policymakers","Better methods","Twitter","importance","reporting lag","healthcare system","stressors","morbidity","study","horizon"],"language":"en"},

Cancer cells activate chemoresistant pathways and lead to therapeutic failure for patients with TNBC. Several kinases have been identified as chemoresistant genes. However, the involvement of kinases in the chemoresistance in TNBC cells is not fully understood. Methods: We employed a kinome siRNA library to screen whether targeting any kinases could increase the chemosensitivity of TNBC cell lines. The effects of kinase on cell viability in various breast cancer cells were validated with ATP level and colony formation. Protein expression and phosphorylation were determined by immunoblotting. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was collected to analyze the correlation of Src expression with prognosis of TNBC patients. Results: Primary screening and validation for the initial hits showed that Src kinase was a potential doxorubicin-resistant kinase in the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T. Both siRNA against Src and the Src inhibitor dasatinib enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in TNBC cells. Moreover, phosphorylation of AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), downstream effectors of Src, were accordingly decreased in Src-silenced or -inhibited TNBC cells. Additionally, TCGA data analysis indicated that Src expression levels in tumor tissues were higher than those in tumor-adjacent normal tissues in patients with TNBC. High co-expression level of Src and STAT3 was also significantly correlated with poor prognosis in patients. Conclusion: Our results showed that Src-STAT3 axis might be involved in chemoresistance of TNBC cells.","publish_time":"2018-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tzeng, Yen-Dun Tony; Liu, Pei-Feng; Li, Ju-Yueh; Liu, Li-Feng; Kuo, Soong-Yu; Hsieh, Chiao-Wei; Lee, Cheng-Hsin; Wu, Chih-Hsuan; Hsiao, Michael; Chang, Hong-Tai; Shu, Chih-Wen","journal":"Front Pharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2890249daa0601affd680a8aadee19b50ed2044d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6238227.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6238227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TNBC","Cancer Genome Atlas","AKT","TCGA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Src kinase","chemoresistance of TNBC cells","inhibited TNBC cells","prognosis of TNBC patients","Src expression levels","correlation of Src expression","Src-STAT3 axis","chemosensitivity of TNBC cell lines","Src inhibitor dasatinib","downstream effectors of Src","High co-expression level of Src","TNBC cell lines MDA-MB","various breast cancer cells","effects of kinase","Protein expression","triple-negative breast cancer","cell viability","tumor tissues","Cancer Genome Atlas","Results","involvement of kinases","potential doxorubicin-resistant kinase","cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin","tumor-adjacent normal tissues","ATP level","chemoresistant pathways","phosphorylation of AKT","chemoresistant genes","poor prognosis","TCGA data analysis","kinome siRNA library","lead","main treatment","therapeutic failure","initial hits","signal transducer","validation","activator of transcription","dataset","Primary screening","Chemotherapy","molecular markers","diagnosis","Background","colony formation","Hs578T","Methods","immunoblotting","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We collected the AHSCT and follow-up data of three patients with refractory JDM who received autologous peripheral blood CD34\u002B cell transplantation in our hospital between June 2004 and July 2015. Those data include: hight, weight, routine blood and urine tests, ESR, CK, ALT, AST, LDH, renal functional tests, lymphocyte subpopulations, HRCT and muscle MRI. The last follow-up was done in June 2017. RESULTS: All three patients had complete remission and could stop prednisone after 3\u201312 months. None of them relapsed at 144, 113 and 23 months follow-up. Twelve months after their AHSCT, all of their monitoring indexes have returned to normal and they have stopped all medications. Until the date of this article, none of them relapsed or need medicine. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that AHSCT is safe and effective in treating refractory JDM, and it can provides long term drug-free survival. However, more cases are needed for further confirmation.","publish_time":"2018-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Jia; Su, Gaixiu; Lai, Jianming; Dong, Boya; Kang, Min; Li, Shengnan; Zhou, Zhixuan; Wu, Fengqi","journal":"Pediatr Rheumatol Online J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76584b14f37aecde3e2c357ad302bca0aea9842c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6245778.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6245778/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AHSCT","refractory JDM","months follow-up","follow-up data","patients","refractory juvenile dermatomyositis","autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","autologous peripheral blood CD34","urine tests","routine blood","long time","renal functional tests","long term drug-free survival","lymphocyte subpopulations","AST","LDH","ESR","HRCT","CK","ALT","weight","muscle MRI","hight","complete remission","prednisone","monitoring indexes","hospital","study","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","date","article","cases","confirmation","medications","OBJECTIVE","METHODS","medicine"],"language":"en"},

ERBs develop a productive MARV infection with low viremia and shedding but no overt disease, suggesting this virus is efficiently controlled by ERB antiviral responses. This dynamic would contrast with humans, where MARV-mediated interferon (IFN) antagonism early in infection is thought to contribute to the severe, often fatal disease. The newly-annotated ERB genome and transcriptome have now enabled us to use a custom-designed NanoString nCounter ERB CodeSet in conjunction with RNA-seq to investigate responses in a MARV-infected ERB cell line. Both transcriptomic platforms correlated well and showed that MARV inhibited the antiviral program in ERB cells, while an IFN antagonism-impaired MARV was less efficient at suppressing the response gene induction, phenotypes previously reported for primate cells. Interestingly, and despite the expansion of IFN loci in the ERB genome, neither MARV showed specific induction of almost any IFN gene. However, we detected an upregulation of putative, unannotated ERB antiviral paralogs, as well as an elevated basal expression in uninfected ERB cells of key antiviral genes.","publish_time":"2018-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arnold, Catherine E.; Guito, Jonathan C.; Altamura, Louis A.; Lovett, Sean P.; Nagle, Elyse R.; Palacios, Gustavo F.; Sanchez-Lockhart, Mariano; Towner, Jonathan S.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f05094f01112523983c9033aa0ba3b0b9ca69f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6266330.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266330/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ERB","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ERB antiviral responses","annotated ERB genome","MARV-infected ERB cell line","unannotated ERB antiviral paralogs","IFN antagonism-impaired MARV","productive MARV infection","uninfected ERB cells of key antiviral genes","MARV-mediated interferon","IFN gene","antiviral program","custom-designed NanoString nCounter ERB CodeSet","primate cells","expansion of IFN loci","response gene induction","specific induction","overt disease","fatal disease","known Marburg virus","conjunction","elevated basal expression","RNA-seq","low viremia","phenotypes","reservoir host","upregulation of putative","humans","Egyptian rousette bat","ERBs","transcriptome","transcriptomic platforms","dynamic"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was distributed among HCWs and trainees who worked or volunteered at the Hajj 2015-2017 through their line managers, or by visiting their hospitals and healthcare centres in Makkah and Mina. Overseas HCWs who accompanied the pilgrims or those who work in foreign Hajj medical missions were excluded.

RESULTS: A total of 138 respondents aged 20 to 59 (median 25.6) years with a male to female ratio of 2.5:1 participated in the survey. Only 11.6% (16/138) participants reported receiving all three vaccines, 15.2% (21/138) did not receive any vaccine, 76.1% (105/138) received meningococcal, 68.1% (94/138) influenza and 13.8% (19/138) pneumococcal vaccine.

The lethality of Ebola virus infection is about 50%, supporting the urgent need to develop anti-Ebola drugs. Glycoprotein (GP) is the only surface protein of the Ebola virus, which is functionally critical for the virus to attach and enter the host cells, and is a promising target for anti-Ebola virus drug development. In this study, using the recombinant HIV-1/Ebola pseudovirus platform we previously established, we evaluated a small molecule library containing various quinoline compounds for anti-Ebola virus entry inhibitors. Some of the quinoline compounds specifically inhibited the entry of the Ebola virus. Among them, compound SYL1712 was the most potent Ebola virus entry inhibitor with an IC(50) of ~1 \u03BCM. The binding of SYL1712 to the vial glycoprotein was computationally modeled and was predicted to interact with specific residues of GP. We used the time of the addition assay to show that compound SYL1712 blocks Ebola GP-mediated entry. Finally, consistent with being an Ebola virus entry inhibitor, compound SYL1712 inhibited infectious Ebola virus replication in tissue culture under biosafety level 4 containment, with an IC(50) of 2 \u03BCM.

The present study aimed to address these issues and estimate the HIV incidence and the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections, using a simple statistical model. METHODS: From among Japanese nationals, yearly incidence data of HIV diagnoses and patients with AIDS who had not previously been diagnosed as HIV positive, from 1985 to 2017, were analyzed. Using the McKendrick partial differential equation, general convolution-like equations were derived, allowing estimation of the HIV incidence and the time-dependent rate of diagnosis. A likelihood-based approach was used to obtain parameter estimates. RESULTS: Assuming that the median incubation period was 10.0 years, the cumulative number of HIV infections was estimated to be 29,613 (95% confidence interval (CI): 29,059, 30,167) by the end of 2017, and the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections was estimated at 80.3% (95% CI [78.7%\u201382.0%]). Allowing the median incubation period to range from 7.5 to 12.3 years, the estimate of the proportion diagnosed can vary from 77% to 84%. DISCUSSION: The proportion of diagnosed HIV infections appears to have not yet reached 90% among Japanese nationals. Compared with the peak incidence from 2005\u20132008, new HIV infections have clearly been in a declining trend; however, there are still more than 1,000 new HIV infections per year in Japan. To increase the diagnosed proportion of HIV infections, it is critical to identify people who have difficulty accessing consultation, testing, and care, and to explore heterogeneous patterns of infection.","publish_time":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f9a39f53149621828b62fd7d65513ee915ac30c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6338104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6338104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["McKendrick"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["HIV incidence","proportion of diagnosed HIV infections","diagnosed proportion of HIV infections","new HIV infections","HIV positive","cumulative number of HIV infections","Epidemiological surveillance of HIV infection","yearly incidence data of HIV diagnoses","median incubation period","peak incidence","years","Japanese nationals","people","AIDS cases","heterogeneous patterns of infection","time-dependent rate of diagnosis","general convolution","McKendrick partial differential equation","technical problems","patients","antiretroviral therapy","care","equations","consultation","difficulty","BACKGROUND","issues","simple statistical model","likelihood-based approach","classical backcalculation method","testing","estimation","DISCUSSION","parameter estimates","present study","confidence interval","METHODS","RESULTS","declining trend"],"language":"en"},

In vivo exposure to chronic mild normobaric hypoxia (10 % oxygen) leads to a number of endogenous adaptations that includes vascular remodeling (angioplasticity). Angioplasticity promotes tissue survival. We have previously shown that induction of adaptive angioplasticity modulates the disease pattern in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In the present study, we define mechanisms by which adaptation to low oxygen functionally ameliorates the signs and symptoms of EAE and for the first time show that tissue hypoxia may fundamentally alter neurodegenerative disease. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were immunized with MOG, and some of them were kept in the hypoxia chambers (day 0) and exposed to 10 % oxygen for 3 weeks, while the others were kept at normoxic environment. Sham-immunized controls were included in both hypoxic and normoxic groups. Animals were sacrificed at pre-clinical and peak disease periods for tissue collection and analysis. RESULTS: Exposure to mild hypoxia decreased histological evidence of inflammation. Decreased numbers of cluster of differentiation (CD)4\u002B T cells were found in the hypoxic spinal cords associated with a delayed Th17-specific cytokine response. Hypoxia-induced changes did not alter the sensitization of peripheral T cells to the MOG peptide. Exposure to mild hypoxia induced significant increases in anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels and an increase in the number of spinal cord CD25\u002BFoxP3\u002B T-regulatory cells. CONCLUSIONS: Acclimatization to mild hypoxia incites a number of endogenous adaptations that induces an anti-inflammatory milieu. Further understanding of these mechanisms system may pinpoint possible new therapeutic targets to treat neurodegenerative disease.","publish_time":"2016-01-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esen, Nilufer; Katyshev, Vladimir; Serkin, Zakhar; Katysheva, Svetlana; Dore-Duffy, Paula","journal":"J Neuroinflammation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b33f78304f8fdb97631ad4b5b5ed9d8d85d0622f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4717549.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0407-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26785841/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAE","MOG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mild hypoxia","tissue hypoxia","hypoxia chambers","Hypoxia-induced changes","chronic mild normobaric hypoxia","neurodegenerative disease","exposure","disease pattern","low oxygen","number of endogenous adaptations","T-regulatory cells","peak disease periods","sensitization of peripheral T cells","compromised delivery of oxygen","tissue collection","MOG peptide","tissue survival","number of spinal cord CD25","hypoxic spinal cords","induction of adaptive angioplasticity","therapeutic approaches","anti-inflammatory IL","mechanisms system","anti-inflammatory milieu","symptoms of EAE","normoxic groups","normoxic environment","chronic inflammatory activity","Decreased numbers of cluster","Sham-immunized controls","possible new therapeutic targets","FoxP3","significant increases","myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein","delayed Th17-specific cytokine response","differentiation","levels","glucose","histological evidence of inflammation","vascular remodeling","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","brain","metabolic balance","signs","analysis","Acclimatization","mice","CONCLUSIONS","time","RESULTS","METHODS","C57BL","Animals","present study","BACKGROUND","day","weeks"],"language":"en"},

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the most important infectious agents in chickens, and in chicken cells, it can be recognized by MDA5 to activate interferon production. RIG-I is considered to be absent in chickens. However, the absence of RIG-I in chickens raises the question of whether this protein influences the antiviral immune response against IBV infection. RESULTS: Here, we showed that chicken cells transfected with domestic goose RIG-I (dgRIG-I) exhibited increased IFN-\u03B2 activity after IBV infection. We also found that IBV can cleave MAVS, an adaptor protein downstream of RIG-I and MDA5 that acts as a platform for antiviral innate immunity at an early stage of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Although chicken MDA5 (chMDA5) is functionally active during IBV infection, the absence of RIG-I may increase the susceptibility of chickens to IBV infection, and IBV may disrupt the activation of the host antiviral response through the cleavage of MAVS.

The present study describes the development and validation of TaqMan probe\u2010based real\u2010time reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR) targeting the S1 coding region of S gene characteristic for the GII\u20101 lineage (formerly the D1466\u2010like variant) of IBV. These strains are quite different from other European IBV belonging to different lineages of the GI genotype. The developed method was 30\u2010fold more sensitive than used so far for standard nested RT\u2010PCR with detection limit of 56 RNA copies per reaction. The specificity of the assay was also evaluated with a panel of different poultry pathogens. Repeatability and reproducibility of the method was very high with coefficients of variation lower than 4%. One hundred and twenty\u2010seven IBV\u2010positive samples were tested by this method and GII\u20101 strains were detected in four of them (3\u00B715%) which indicate a decrease in the GII\u20101 IBV prevalence in Poland.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinic-microbiological features of patients with CAP presenting with ground-glass opacity (GGO) and centrilobular nodules or tree-in-bud pattern on CT images. Methods Patients with CAP who underwent a CT scan at presentation were retrospectively classified using CT findings into consolidation, GGO and bronchiolitis groups. These 3 groups were compared in terms of clinical parameters and microbiological data. Results A total of 40 patients (2.4%) were allocated to the bronchiolitis group and 46 (2.8%) to the GGO group. The most common pathogen in the bronchiolitis group was Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which was significantly more frequently isolated in this group. The bronchiolitis group was characterized by a higher percentage of cough, a lower percentage of chest pain and lower blood levels of inflammatory markers. Common pathogens in the GGO group were not significantly different from those in the other 2 groups. Unlike that observed in the consolidation group, complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema was not observed in the bronchiolitis or GGO group. Outcome variables were similar in the 3 groups. Conclusions The bronchiolitis group was characterized by a higher frequency of M. pneumoniae and a less severe form of CAP. The GGO and consolidation groups was similar with respect to causative microorganisms and the clinical features of CAP.

The present situation arising from the recent public health crises, and particularly from the current economic depression, offers a major chance to introduce the needed changes in health oriented actions.","publish_time":"2010-07-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Urbanos, Rosa","journal":"Gac Sanit","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131592.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2010.05.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20667626/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health authorities","social determinants of health","health oriented actions","equitable health policy design","recent public health crises","factors","needed changes","institutional inertia","institutional organization","Structural changes","sectors","cooperation mechanisms","cultural patterns","inadequate collaboration","poor coordination","experts","major chance","biomedical paradigm","agents","lobbies","levels of government","practitioners","knowledge","current economic depression","consolidation","impact of non-healthcare policies","new space","present situation","foreign experiences","network governance"],"language":"en"},

Infections in humans may be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. This study describes the isolation and identification of a natural reassortant MRV from least horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus pusillu) in China, referred to as RpMRV-YN2012. METHODS AND RESULTS: The RpMRV-YN2012 was obtained from urine samples of Rhinolophus pusillus by cell culture. Negative-staining electron microscopy revealed that RpMRV-YN2012 was a non-enveloped icosahedral virus with \u223C75 nm in diameter. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) migration patterns of the genome segments showed that RpMRV-YN2012 contained 10 segments in a 3:3:4 arrangement. The whole genome sequence of RpMRV2012 was determined. The consensus terminal sequences of all segments of 5\u2019-GCUAh\u2026yUCAUC-3\u2019 (h = A, U or C; y = C or U) were similar to the MRV species within the genus Orthoreovirus. Its evolution and evidence of genetic reassortment were analyzed by sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that RpMRV-YN2012 is a novel serotype 2 MRV that may have originated from reassortment among bat, human, and/or pig MRV strains which associated with diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis and necrotizing encephalopathy in animals and humans. CONCLUSIONS: RpMRV-YN2012 is a novel bat reassortant MRV, which may have resulted from a reassortment involving MRVs known to infect humans and animals. It is necessary to identify whether RpMRV-YN2012 is associated with diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis and necrotizing encephalopathy in clinical patients. In addition, we should carefully monitor its evolution and virulence in real time.","publish_time":"2015-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Lihua; Fu, Shihong; Cao, Lei; Lei, Wenwen; Cao, Yuxi; Song, Jingdong; Tang, Qing; Zhang, Hailin; Feng, Yun; Yang, Weihong; Liang, Guodong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cde537507323b28a413a559c934c435b24546c63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4364601.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25781475/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["RpMRV-YN2012","MRV species","humans","novel bat reassortant MRV","natural reassortant MRV","genome segments","pig MRV strains","diarrhea","necrotizing encephalopathy","acute gastroenteritis","MRVs","animals","evolution","RESULTS","evidence of genetic reassortment","genome sequence of RpMRV2012","novel serotype","sequence comparison","urine samples of Rhinolophus pusillus","migration patterns","horseshoe bats","PAGE","non-enveloped icosahedral virus","identification","Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","cell culture","clinical patients","Negative-staining electron microscopy","nm","isolation","China","wide geographic distribution","Mammalian orthoreoviruses","virulence","real time","BACKGROUND","phylogenetic analysis","consensus terminal sequences","genus Orthoreovirus","yUCAUC","study","diameter","GCUAh","Infections","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","mammals","arrangement","addition"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 causes a severe pneumonia characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Similar coronavirus outbreaks have occurred in the past causing severe pneumonia like COVID-19, most recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, over time, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shown to cause extra-pulmonary signs and symptoms including hepatitis, acute renal failure, encephalitis, myositis, and gastroenteritis. Similarly, sporadic reports of COVID-19 related extrapulmonary manifestations emerge. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive summary of the multi-organ manifestations of COVID-19, making it difficult for clinicians to quickly educate themselves about this highly contagious and deadly pathogen. What\u0027s more, is that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are the closest humanity has come to combating something similar to COVID-19, however, there exists no comparison between the manifestations of any of these novel coronaviruses.

The RNA genome of SARS-CoV is complexed by the nucleocapsid protein (N) to form a helical nucleocapsid. Besides this primary function, N seems to be involved in apoptotic scenarios. We show that upon infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV, which elicits a pronounced cytopathic effect and a high viral titer, N is cleaved by caspases. In contrast, in SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells, which show a moderate cytopathic effect and a low viral titer, this processing of N was not observed. To further verify these observations, we transiently expressed N in different cell lines. Caco-2 and N2a cells served as models for persistent SARS-CoV infection, whereas Vero E6 and A549 cells did as prototype cell lines lytically infected by SARS-CoV. The experiments revealed that N induces the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, resulting in processing of N at residues 400 and 403 by caspase-6 and/or caspase-3. Of note, caspase activation is highly cell type specific in SARS-CoV-infected as well as transiently transfected cells. In Caco-2 and N2a cells, almost no N-processing was detectable. In Vero E6 and A549 cells, a high proportion of N was cleaved by caspases. Moreover, we examined the subcellular localization of SARS-CoV N in these cell lines. In transfected Vero E6 and A549 cells, SARS-CoV N was localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas in Caco-2 and N2a cells, nearly no nuclear localization was observed. In addition, our studies indicate that the nuclear localization of N is essential for its caspase-6-mediated cleavage. These data suggest a correlation among the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, subcellular localization of N, induction of apoptosis, and the subsequent activation of caspases leading to cleavage of N.","publish_time":"2008-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diemer, Claudia; Schneider, Martha; Seebach, Judith; Quaas, Janine; Fr\u00F6sner, Gert; Sch\u00E4tzl, Hermann M.; Gilch, Sabine","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/daf6240f1e98e7a0f23fcf4239a43ae8280d3153.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094231.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283607015811; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607015811","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV N","processing of N","N-processing","designated SARS-CoV","subcellular localization of N","nuclear localization of N","persistent SARS-CoV infection","A549 cells","N2a cells","subcellular localization of SARS","transfected cells","high proportion of N","infection of Vero E6 cells","replication cycle of SARS","RNA genome of SARS","infected Caco","transfected Vero E6","caspase activation","prototype cell lines","different cell lines","high viral titer","cell type specific","subsequent activation of caspases","cleavage of","low viral titer","moderate cytopathic effect","pronounced cytopathic effect","nucleocapsid protein","mediated cleavage","apoptotic scenarios","helical nucleocapsid","intrinsic apoptotic pathway","epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","models","induction of apoptosis","correlation","novel coronavirus","studies","note","cytoplasm","residues","data","nucleus","primary function","experiments","contrast","addition","observations"],"language":"en"},

The dynamical characteristics of an isolated population are preliminary studied, with particular reference to the equilibrium points and their stability. Then, the effects of constant inputs on the dynamics are deeply analyzed also by numerical simulations; this analysis is propaedeutic to the study of the interaction between the groups. The interactions between the different populations are modeled as additional input/output to the single group dynamics introducing total averaged effects including all the external migration effects. This approach focuses on the changes in the dynamics of one population when interactions are present without showing the global migration fluxes, but stressing the influences on each populations. Besides the simplifications of the model, this point of view may be fruitful also with respect of the design of control actions, assuming that each group can adopt the best control strategy for her/his own specific social characteristics. The epidemic case analyzed is HIV-AIDS. This choice has been made since this virus is present all over the world, but with different levels of dangerousness and number of infected patients depending on the economic, social, and cultural habits. The model used is a recently introduced one, which describes this epidemic spread considering two compartments of susceptible people, distinguished by the level of attention with respect to the virus transmission, one of the infected individuals not aware of their status, and two classes of patients, divided according to the level of infection. Additional inputs have been introduced to model fluxes of susceptible individuals and infected but not aware individuals. These effects have been reported in numerous figures showing the results of numerical simulations.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Giamberardino, Paolo; Iacoviello, Daniela","journal":"Control Applications for Biomedical Engineering Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2b854e724fc82333325071ec6d63d0a76f385bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153349.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128174616000081; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128174616000081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected individuals","model fluxes of susceptible individuals","aware individuals","external migration effects","effects of constant inputs","single group dynamics","total averaged effects","number of infected patients","respect","different populations","Additional inputs","specific social characteristics","interactions","global migration fluxes","results of numerical simulations","isolated population","virus transmission","epidemic spread","classes of patients","level of attention","epidemic case","groups of subjects","dynamical characteristics","level of infection","different levels of dangerousness","compartments of susceptible people","design of control actions","best control strategy","specific infectious disease","particular reference","output","status","numerous figures","equilibrium points","problem","study","analysis","point of view","HIV-AIDS","chapter","cultural habits","world","changes","influences","Abstract","stability","simplifications","approach","choice"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report a new strategy for isolating desired antibodies from a combinatorial library in one day by repeated fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). First, we constructed a library of synthetic human antibody in which single-chain variable fragment (scFv) was expressed in the periplasm of Escherichia coli. After labeling the cells with fluorescent antigen probes, the highly fluorescent cells were sorted by using a high-speed cell sorter, and these cells were reused without regeneration in the next round of sorting. After repeating this sorting, the positive clones were completely enriched in several hours. Thus, we screened the library against three viral antigens, including the H1N1 influenza virus, Hepatitis B virus, and Foot-and-mouth disease virus. Finally, the potential antibody candidates, which show K(D) values between 10 and 100 nM against the target antigens, could be successfully isolated even though the library was relatively small (\u223C10(6)). These results show that repeated FACS screening without regeneration of the sorted cells can be a powerful method when a rapid response to a spreading disease is required.","publish_time":"2014-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yim, Sung Sun; Bang, Hyun Bae; Kim, Young Hwan; Lee, Yong Jae; Jeong, Gu Min; Jeong, Ki Jun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a3ef8eca5d6cd4d7a0fef83335cc02a2347492c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4193741.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25303314/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FACS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibody screening","fluorescent cells","sorted cells","library of synthetic human antibody","combinatorial library","mouth disease virus","repeated FACS screening","potential antibody candidates","regeneration","spreading disease","round of sorting","repeated fluorescence-activated cell sorting","H1N1 influenza virus","Hepatitis B virus","desired antibodies","viral antigens","target antigens","fluorescent antigen probes","high-speed cell sorter","technology","day","Foot","single-chain variable fragment","huge libraries","scFv","rapid response","powerful method","important agents","long time","significant progress","prompt action","therapeutics","diagnostics","nM","derivatives","new strategy","results","positive clones","periplasm of Escherichia coli","values","hours"],"language":"en"},

Such integrated travel network (ITN) model should incorporate the diversity among links as dictated by the distances between cities and different speeds of different modes of transportation, diversity among nodes as dictated by the population and the ease of travelling due to infrastructures and economic development of a city, and round-trip journeys to targeted destinations via the paths of shortest travel times typical of human journeys. An example is constructed for 116 cities in China with populations over one million that are connected by high-speed train services and highways. Epidemic spread on the constructed network is studied. It is revealed both numerically and theoretically that the traveling speed and frequency are important factors of epidemic spreading. Depending on the infection rate, increasing the traveling speed would result in either an enhanced or suppressed epidemic, while increasing the traveling frequency enhances the epidemic spreading.","publish_time":"2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruan, Zhongyuan; Wang, Chaoqing; Ming Hui, Pak; Liu, Zonghua","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae7835c99d1391c53fec8da5b13783ebdd195223.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4466778.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26073191/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep11401","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["cities","suppressed epidemic","epidemic outbreaks","traveling frequency","traveling speed","constructed network","important factors of epidemic spreading","integrated travel network","network science","round-trip journeys","diversity","ease","impact of frequent journeys","paths of shortest travel times typical of human journeys","different speeds of different modes of transportation","health control","city","destinations","ITN","great importance","infrastructures","nodes","distances","economic development","new framework of modelling","high-speed train services","highways","links","epidemics","infection rate","traveller\u2019s viewpoint","China","populations","threat","example","globalization"],"language":"en"},

Codon usage (CU) was measured for the viral spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2) and papain-like protease (PLpro) genes from a diverse set of A. coronavirus lineages and for G. gallus genes (lung surfactant protein A, intestinal cholecystokinin, oviduct ovomucin alpha subunit, kidney vitamin D receptor and the ubiquitary beta-actin) for different A. coronavirus replicating sites. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) trees accommodating all virus and host genes in a single topology showed a higher proximity of A. coronavirus CU to the respiratory tract for all genes. The codon adaptation index (CAI) showed a lower adaptation of S to G. gallus compared to NSP2, PLpro and N. The effective number of codons (Nc) and GC3% revealed that natural selection and genetic drift are the evolutionary forces driving the codon usage evolution of both A. coronavirus and G. gallus regardless of the gene being considered. The spike gene showed only one 100% conserved amino acid position coded by an A. coronavirus preferred codon, a significantly low number when compared to the three other genes (p \u003C0.0001).

The MERS-CoV epidemic started in 2012 and is still ongoing, with a mortality rate of approximately 35%. No vaccine is available against MERS-CoV and therapeutic options for MERS-CoV infections are limited to palliative and supportive care. A search for specific antiviral treatments is urgently needed. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, with the spike proteins present on their surface responsible for virus entry into the target cell. Lectins are attractive anti-coronavirus candidates because of the highly glycosylated nature of the spike protein. We tested the antiviral effect of griffithsin (GRFT), a lectin isolated from the red marine alga Griffithsia sp. against MERS-CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that while displaying no significant cytotoxicity, griffithsin is a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV infection. Griffithsin also inhibits entry into host cells of particles pseudotyped with the MERS-CoV spike protein, suggesting that griffithsin inhibits spike protein function during entry. Spike proteins have a dual function during entry, they mediate binding to the host cell surface and also the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membrane. Time course experiments show that griffithsin inhibits MERS-CoV infection at the binding step. In conclusion, we identify griffithsin as a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV infection at the entry step.","publish_time":"2016-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Millet, Jean K.; S\u00E9ron, Karin; Labitt, Rachael N.; Danneels, Adeline; Palmer, Kenneth E.; Whittaker, Gary R.; Dubuisson, Jean; Belouzard, Sandrine","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35bf19aea5a4e8fe285de47f703c0aba07825570.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113895.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354216301723; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354216301723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27424494/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.07.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV spike protein","MERS-CoV infections","MERS-CoV epidemic","potent inhibitor of MERS","entry step","spike protein function","virus entry","antiviral effect of griffithsin","spike proteins present","host cell surface","host cell membrane","target cell","binding step","severe respiratory syndrome","host cells of particles","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","surface responsible","dual function","pathogenic human coronaviruses","specific antiviral treatments","attractive anti-coronavirus candidates","therapeutic options","fusion","red marine alga Griffithsia","glycosylated nature","viral envelope","enveloped viruses","Lectins","GRFT","significant cytotoxicity","Time course experiments","search","vaccine","supportive care","mortality rate","results","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Using weekly cut-offs, we sought to determine the probability that an individual would return to clinic given that they had not yet returned in order to identify the LTFU cut-off that could be used to inform clinical management and tracing procedures. METHODS: Individuals who initiated ART with Dignitas International supported sites (n = 22) in Zomba, Malawi between January 1 2007-June 30 2010 and were \u2265 1 week late for a follow-up visit were included. Lateness was categorized using weekly cut-offs from \u22651 to \u226526 weeks late. At each weekly cut-off, the proportion of patients who returned for a subsequent follow-up visit were identified. Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) were plotted to determine the probability of returning as a function of lateness. Hazard functions were plotted to demonstrate the proportion of patients who returned each weekly interval relative to those who had yet to return. RESULTS: In total, n = 4484 patients with n = 7316 follow-up visits were included. The number of included follow-up visits per patient ranged from 1\u201310 (median: 1). Both the CDF and hazard function demonstrated that after being \u22659 weeks late, the proportion of new patients who returned relative to those who had yet to return decreased substantially. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a LTFU definition useful for clinical management. The simple functions plotted here did not require advanced statistical expertise and were created using Microsoft Excel, making it a particularly practical method for HIV programs in resource-constrained settings.

Nasopharyngeal samples from children aged \u003C12 years who were admitted to Kilifi District Hospital during 2007\u20132010 with severe or very severe pneumonia and resided in the local demographic surveillance system were screened for influenza A, B, and C viruses by molecular methods. Outpatient children provided comparative data. Results. Of 2002 admissions, influenza A virus infection was diagnosed in 3.5% (71), influenza B virus infection, in 0.9% (19); and influenza C virus infection, in 0.8% (11 of 1404 tested). Four patients with influenza died. Among outpatients, 13 of 331 (3.9%) with acute respiratory infection and 1 of 196 without acute respiratory infection were influenza positive. The annual incidence of severe or very severe pneumonia, of influenza (any type), and of influenza A, was 1321, 60, and 43 cases per 100 000 \u003C5 years of age, respectively.

As hospitals work to acquire enough personal protective equipment and brace for potential cases, the role of infection prevention efforts and programs has become increasingly important. Lessons from the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak in Toronto and 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea have unveiled the critical role that hospitals play in outbreaks, especially of novel coronaviruses. Their ability to amplify the spread of disease can rapidly fuel transmission of the disease, and often those failures in infection prevention and general hospital practices contribute to such events. While efforts to enhance infection prevention measures and hospital readiness are underway in the United States, it is important to understand why these programs were not able to maintain continued, sustainable levels of readiness. History has shown that infection prevention programs are primarily responsible for preparing hospitals and responding to biological events but face understaffing and focused efforts defined by administrators. The current US health care system, though, is built upon a series of priorities that often view biopreparedness as a costly endeavor. Awareness of these competing priorities and the challenges that infection prevention programs face when working to maintain biopreparedness is critical in adequately addressing this critical infrastructure in the face of an international outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Popescu, Saskia","journal":"Disaster Med Public Health Prep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8db5ac75f59eba3cfbb76d47ac54229fba02f596.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156573.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32223774/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.55","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Toronto","South Korea","United States"],"keyphrases":["infection prevention programs","role of infection prevention efforts","infection prevention measures","health care efforts","SARS-CoV outbreak","international outbreak","hospitals","face","MERS-CoV outbreak","critical role","focused efforts","hospital readiness","international public health","critical infrastructure","biopreparedness","current US health care system","biological events","competing priorities","series of priorities","spread of disease","novel coronaviruses","general hospital practices","sustainable levels of readiness","potential cases","brace","South Korea","Toronto","personal protective equipment","understaffing","outbreaks","failures","challenges","United States","transmission","administrators","History","ability","costly endeavor","Awareness","Lessons"],"language":"en"},

However, the significant heterogeneity and less critical outcomes of such trials may be leading to a waste of research resources. This study aimed to develop a core outcome set (COS) for clinical trials on COVID-19 in order to tackle the outcome issues. The study was conducted according to the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) handbook (version 1.0), a guideline for COS development. A research group was set up that included experts in respiratory and critical medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, evidence-based medicine, clinical pharmacology, and statistics, in addition to medical journal editors. Clinical trial registry websites (chictr.org.cn and clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to retrieve clinical trial protocols and outcomes in order to form an outcome pool. A total of 78 clinical trial protocols on COVID-19 were included and 259 outcomes were collected. After standardization, 132 outcomes were identified within seven different categories, of which 58 were selected to develop a preliminary outcome list for further consensus. After two rounds of Delphi survey and one consensus meeting, the most important outcomes for the different clinical classifications of COVID-19 were identified and determined to constitute the COS for clinical trials on COVID-19 (COS-COVID). The COS-COVID includes one outcome for the mild type (time to 2019-nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity), four outcomes for the ordinary type (length of hospital stay, composite events, score of clinical symptoms, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), five outcomes for the severe type (composite events, length of hospital stay, arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), duration of mechanical ventilation, and time to 2019-nCoV RT-PCR negativity), one outcome for critical type (all-cause mortality), and one outcome for rehabilitation period (pulmonary function). The COS-COVID is currently the most valuable and practical clinical outcome set for the evaluation of intervention effect, and is useful for evidence assessment and decision-making. With a deepening understanding of COVID-19 and application feedback, the COS-COVID should be continuously updated.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jin, Xinyao; Pang, Bo; Zhang, Junhua; Liu, Qingquan; Yang, Zhongqi; Feng, Jihong; Liu, Xuezheng; Zhang, Lei; Wang, Baohe; Huang, Yuhong; Josephine Fauci, Alice; Ma, Yuling; Soo Lee, Myeong; Yuan, Wei\u0027an; Xie, Yanming; Tang, Jianyuan; Gao, Rui; Du, Liang; Zhang, Shuo; Qi, Hanmei; Sun, Yu; Zheng, Wenke; Yang, Fengwen; Chua, Huizi; Wang, Keyi; Ou, Yi; Huang, Ming; Zhu, Yan; Yu, Jiajie; Tian, Jinhui; Zhao, Min; Hu, Jingqing; Yao, Chen; Li, Youping; Zhang, Boli","journal":"Engineering (Beijing)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/165562ba942e0a8aa506fdf31fd8ade1a7e0ef1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102592.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095809920300424; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809920300424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292626/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COS development","clinicaltrials.gov","COS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COS-COVID","practical clinical outcome","different clinical classifications of COVID","clinical pharmacology","series of clinical trials","critical outcomes","outcome issues","outcome pool","clinical trial protocols","core outcome set","Core Outcome Measures","score of clinical symptoms","important outcomes","deepening understanding of COVID","COS development","Clinical trial registry websites","preliminary outcome list","critical type","critical medicine","time","Effectiveness Trials","nCoV RT-PCR negativity","severe type","ordinary type","mild type","evidence-based medicine","length of hospital","composite events","order","study","traditional Chinese medicine","evidence assessment","consensus meeting","different categories","research group","nCoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","fraction of inspired oxygen","waste of research resources","arterial oxygen partial pressure","PaO2","FiO2","statistics","COMET","all-cause mortality","addition","Coronavirus Disease","duration of mechanical ventilation","evaluation of intervention effect","application feedback","version","handbook","rehabilitation period","pulmonary function","experts","medical journal editors","rounds of Delphi survey","decision-making","guideline","significant heterogeneity","total","outbreak","Abstract","standardization"],"language":"en"},

Viral determinants of NDV virulence are not completely understood. The amino acid sequence at the protease cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein has been postulated as a major determinant of NDV virulence. In this study, we have examined the role of F protein cleavage site sequence in NDV virulence using reverse genetics technology. The sequence G-R-Q-G-R present at the cleavage site of the F protein of avirulent strain LaSota was mutated to R-R-Q-K-R, which is present in the F cleavage site of neurovirulent strain Beaudette C (BC). The resultant mutated LaSota V.F. virus did not require exogenous protease for infectivity in cell culture, indicating that the F protein was cleaved by intracellular proteases. The virulence of the mutant and parental viruses was evaluated in vivo by intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) tests in chickens. Our results showed that the modification of the F protein cleavage site resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence from an ICPI value of 0.00 for LaSota to a value of 1.12 for LaSota V.F. However, the ICPI value of LaSota V.F. was lower than that of BC, which had a value of 1.58. Interestingly, the IVPI tests showed values of 0.00 for both LaSota and LaSota V.F. viruses, compared to the IVPI value of 1.45 of BC. In vitro characteristics of the viruses were also studied. Our results demonstrate that the efficiency of cleavage of the F protein plays an important role if the NDV is delivered directly into the brains of chicks, but there could be other viral factors that probably affect peripheral replication, viremia, or entry into the central nervous system.","publish_time":"2003-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Panda, Aruna; Huang, Zhuhui; Elankumaran, Subbiah; Rockemann, Daniel D; Samal, Siba K","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fba236804cbfe944da479bb6e82abb0c53b47a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125746.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401003001669; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401003001669","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["LaSota V."],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV","LaSota V.F."],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["R-R","ICPI value of LaSota","role of F protein cleavage site sequence","F protein of avirulent strain LaSota","protease cleavage site","IVPI value","efficiency of cleavage","R present","sequence G-R","F cleavage site of neurovirulent strain Beaudette C","resultant mutated LaSota","Viral determinants of NDV virulence","major determinant of NDV virulence","BC","IVPI tests","Q-G","important role","parental viruses","important disease","results","intravenous pathogenicity index","intracerebral pathogenicity index","amino acid sequence","Newcastle disease virus","exogenous protease","viral factors","entry","dramatic increase","cell culture","peripheral replication","reverse genetics technology","modification","fusion","viremia","infectivity","central nervous system","poultry","chickens","mutant","intracellular proteases","values","brains of chicks","study","characteristics"],"language":"en"},

Identifying and cataloguing the viruses of bats is a logical approach to evaluate the range of potential zoonoses of bat origin. We characterized the fecal pathogen microbiome of both insectivorous and frugivorous bats, incorporating 281 individual bats comprising 20 common species, which were sampled in three locations of Yunnan province, by combining reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and next-generation sequencing. Seven individual bats were paramyxovirus-positive by RT-PCR using degenerate primers, and these paramyxoviruses were mainly classified into three genera (Rubulavirus, Henipavirus and Jeilongvirus). Various additional novel pathogens were detected in the paramyxovirus-positive bats using Illumina sequencing. A total of 7066 assembled contigs (\u2265200 bp) were constructed, and 105 contigs matched eukaryotic viruses (of them 103 belong to 2 vertebrate virus families, 1 insect virus, and 1 mycovirus), 17 were parasites, and 4913 were homologous to prokaryotic microorganisms. Among the 103 vertebrate viral contigs, 79 displayed low identity (\u003C70%) to known viruses including human viruses at the amino acid level, suggesting that these belong to novel and genetically divergent viruses. Overall, the most frequently identified viruses, particularly in bats from the family Hipposideridae, were retroviruses. The present study expands our understanding of the bat virome in species commonly found in Yunnan, China, and provides insight into the overall diversity of viruses that may be capable of directly or indirectly crossing over into humans.","publish_time":"2014-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Lihong; Li, Min; Li, Linmiao; Monagin, Corina; Chmura, Aleksei A.; Schneider, Bradley S.; Epstein, Jonathan H.; Mei, Xiaolin; Shi, Zhengli; Daszak, Peter; Chen, Jinping","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03148d1ba3c986ec7306ab2a90bcd6082c512f49.json; document_parses/pdf_json/247a9eae1e4452f7f969ab41a88f335fda54fbc9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4036550.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v6052138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24841387/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Illumina"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["viruses of bats","individual bats","human viruses","divergent viruses","eukaryotic viruses","identified viruses","frugivorous bats","paramyxovirus-positive bats","overall diversity of viruses","emerging zoonotic viruses of public health importance","RT-PCR","vertebrate viral contigs","assembled contigs","vertebrate virus families","insect virus","bat virome","common species","Illumina sequencing","generation sequencing","locations of Yunnan province","Various additional novel pathogens","range of potential zoonoses of bat origin","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","understanding","assays","insight","recognized reservoirs","degenerate primers","logical approach","amino acid level","fecal pathogen microbiome","low identity","Rubulavirus","Henipavirus","Jeilongvirus","paramyxoviruses","mycovirus","China","family Hipposideridae","present study","prokaryotic microorganisms","parasites","retroviruses","total","bp","humans"],"language":"en"},

RECENT FINDINGS: Studies focused on occupational exposures to infectious agents, dust and allergens, pesticides, and occupational injury. Research on zoonotic MRSA used whole genome\u2013sequencing technologies to evaluate transmission in Africa and Asia. Swine worker exposure to porcine coronavirus and emerging influenza A viruses was documented in China. 16s RNA amplicon sequencing identified distinct microbiota compositions in households with active animal farmers. Multiple bioaerosol exposures were assessed for industrial dairy workers. Occupational injury studies highlighted the struggles of Latino animal workers in the USA.

However, the function of P2 receptors in viral infection has been little explored. Here we demonstrated that P2Y(13) and its ligand ADP play an important role in protecting hosts from viral infections. First, we demonstrate that P2Y(13), as a typical interferon-stimulated gene, is induced together with extracellular ADP during viral infection. Most importantly, extracellular ADP restricts the replication of different kinds of viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, herpes simplex virus 1, and murine leukemia virus. This kind of protection is dependent on P2Y(13) but not P2Y(1) or P2Y(12), which are also considered as receptors for ADP. Furthermore, cyclic adenosine monophosphate and EPAC1 are downregulated by extracellular ADP through the P2Y(13)-coupled Gi alpha subunit. Accordingly, inhibition or deletion of EPAC1 significantly eliminates ADP/P2Y(13)-mediated antiviral activities. Taken together, our results show that P2Y(13) and ADP play pivotal roles in the clearance of invaded virus and have the potential as antiviral targets.","publish_time":"2018-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Chengfei; Yan, Yan; He, Hongwang; Wang, Li; Zhang, Na; Zhang, Jie; Huang, Hongjun; Wu, Nannan; Ren, Hua; Qian, Min; Liu, Mingyao; Du, Bing","journal":"J Mol Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f24733de9c87814677763710797b204f75d4b68c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107496.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30137373/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jmcb/mjy045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADP","Newcastle"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["P2Y","extracellular ADP","ligand ADP","Newcastle disease virus","vesicular stomatitis virus","herpes simplex virus","clearance of invaded virus","murine leukemia virus","purinergic receptors","viral infections","important sensors of extracellular danger signals","function of P2 receptors","important role","crucial roles","pivotal roles","deletion of EPAC1","antiviral targets","antiviral activities","replication of different kinds of viruses","hosts","host defense","potential","cyclic adenosine monophosphate","typical interferon-stimulated gene","kind of protection","Gi alpha subunit","inhibition","results"],"language":"en"},

Existing habitat-based models do not consider interspecies pathogen transmission, a primary route for emergence of new infectious diseases and reservoirs in wildlife and man. The modeling of interspecies transmission has the potential to provide more accurate predictions of disease persistence and emergence dynamics. The new models are motivated by our recent work on hantavirus in rodent communities in Paraguay. Our Paraguayan data illustrate the spatial and temporal overlap among rodent species, one of which is the reservoir species for Jabora virus and others which are spillover species. Disease transmission occurs when their habitats overlap. Two mathematical models, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model, are developed for spread of hantavirus between a reservoir and a spillover species. Analysis of a special case of the ODE model provides an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number, \u211B(0), such that if \u211B(0) \u003C 1, then the pathogen does not persist in either population but if \u211B(0) \u003E 1, pathogen outbreaks or persistence may occur. Numerical simulations of the CTMC model display sporadic disease incidence, a new behavior of our habitat-based model, not present in other models, but which is a prominent feature of the seroprevalence data from Paraguay. Environmental changes that result in greater habitat overlap result in more encounters among various species that may lead to pathogen outbreaks and pathogen establishment in a new host.","publish_time":"2009-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Allen, Linda J.

The quantity of the individual MV mRNA species was quite different in comparison to lytically infected Vero cells. A steep gradient of MV transcripts was found in brain tissue which is most likely due to strongly attenuated transcription of mRNAs along the viral genome, representing particularly low transcription of the glycoprotein genes. In addition, in vitro translation assays only revealed synthesis of N and P protein in consistent fashion. The mRNAs for the glycoproteins did not direct the synthesis of detectable viral proteins whereas the M mRNA revealed some activity in animals with AE. The data indicate a strong restriction of the MV envelope gene expression in infected brain tissue, which is independent of the incubation time and type of the central nervous system (CNS) disease.

Thus, in addition to recombination and mutation, HCoV genomes evolve through gene gains and losses. In this review we summarize recent findings on the molecular evolution of HCoV genomes, with special attention to recombination and adaptive events that generated new viral species and contributed to host shifts and to HCoV emergence.

Differences in spatial and temporal dynamics of these infections are poorly understood. Therefore, we inoculated ferrets with seasonal H3N2, pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus and performed detailed virological and pathological analyses at time points from 0.5 to 14 days post inoculation (dpi), as well as describing clinical signs and hematological parameters. H3N2 infection was restricted to the nose and peaked at 1 dpi. pH1N1 infection also peaked at 1 dpi, but occurred at similar levels throughout the respiratory tract. H5N1 infection occurred predominantly in the alveoli, where it peaked for a longer period, from 1 to 3 dpi. The associated lesions followed the same spatial distribution as virus infection, but their severity peaked between 1 and 6 days later. Neutrophil and monocyte counts in peripheral blood correlated with inflammatory cell influx in the alveoli. Of the different parameters used to measure lower respiratory tract disease, relative lung weight and affected lung tissue allowed the best quantitative distinction between the virus groups. There was extra-respiratory spread to more tissues\u2014including the central nervous system\u2014for H5N1 infection than for pH1N1 infection, and to none for H3N2 infection. This study shows that seasonal, pandemic, and zoonotic influenza viruses differ strongly in the spatial and temporal dynamics of infection in the respiratory tract and extra-respiratory tissues of ferrets.","publish_time":"2012-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Brand, Judith M.

From the beginning, the disease was dreaded because of its epidemic nature, predilection for previously healthy children and adolescents, and high mortality. In the last decade of the 19th century, the concept of serum therapy for toxin-related bacterial diseases was identified. This concept was applied to meningococcal disease therapy, in an independent way, by Wilhelm Kolle, August von Wasserman, and Georg Jochmann in Germany, and Simon Flexner in the USA, resulting in the first successful approach for the treatment of meningococcal disease. During the first three decades of the 20th century, serum therapy was the standard treatment for meningococcal disease. With the advent of sulphamides first and then antibiotics, serum therapy was abandoned. The great challenges that infectious diseases medicine is facing and the awaiting menaces in the future in terms of increasing antibiotic resistance, emergence of new pathogens, and re-emergence of old ones without effective therapy, make passive immunotherapy a promising tool. Acknowledging the achievements of our predecessors might teach us some lessons to bring light to our future.","publish_time":"2019-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Pere; Pomar, Virginia; Mauri, Albert; Barquet, Nicolau","journal":"The Lancet Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0d9cf8d4a2ffadd021ee90851ddf9f0c37738ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106525.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(19)30040-4; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309919300404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31053493/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309919300404","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Anton Weichselbaum","Wilhelm Kolle","Georg Jochmann","Simon Flexner"],"organizations":["Gaspard Vieusseux"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["meningococcal disease therapy","treatment of meningococcal disease","concept of serum therapy","Summary Meningococcal disease","effective therapy","century","future","standard treatment","infectious diseases medicine","toxin-related bacterial diseases","emergence of new pathogens","re-emergence of old ones","healthy children","terms","antibiotic resistance","passive immunotherapy","independent way","Wasserman","Germany","adolescents","predilection","Simon Flexner","Georg Jochmann","awaiting menaces","epidemic nature","Wilhelm Kolle","great challenges","antibiotics","successful approach","causative agent","high mortality","promising tool","Anton Weichselbaum","lessons","advent of sulphamides","Diplococcus intracellularis menigitidis","predecessors","light","Gaspard Vieusseux","decades","achievements","beginning"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: The general recommendations to mitigate the potential detriment of an unexpected shortage of radiotherapy facilities include: (1) maintain current standards of care as long as possible (2) refer to another specialist paediatric radiotherapy department with similar level of expertise (3) prioritise use of existing radiotherapy resources to treat patients with tumours where radiotherapy has the most effect on clinical outcome (4) use chemotherapy to defer the start of radiotherapy where timing of radiotherapy is not expected to be detrimental (5) active surveillance for low-grade tumours if appropriate and (6) consider iso-effective hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens only for selected patients with predicted poor prognosis. The effectiveness of radiotherapy and recommendations for prioritisation of its use for common and challenging paediatric tumours are discussed.

Although the recent re-emergence of human rabies in China was noted in several epidemiological studies, little attention was paid to the reasons behind this phenomenon paralleling the findings of the previous reports. The purpose of this study is thus first to characterize the current trends of human rabies in China from 1990 to 2007, and then to define better recommendations for improving the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) schedules delivered to rabies patients. METHODS: The most updated epidemiological data for 22527 human rabies cases from January 1990 to July 2007, retrieved from the surveillance database of reportable diseases managed by the Ministry of Health of China, were analysed. To investigate the efficiency for the post-exposure treatment of rabies, the details of 244 rabies patients, including their anti-rabies treatment of injuries or related incidents, were ascertained in Guangdong provincial jurisdiction. The risk factors to which the patients were predisposed or the regimens given to 80 patients who received any type of PEP were analysed to identify the reasons for the PEP failures. RESULTS: The results from analysis of the large number of human rabies cases showed that rabies in China was largely under control during the period 1990\u20131996. However, there has been a large jump in the number of reported rabies cases since 2001 up to a new peak (with an incidence rate of 0.20 per 100000 people) that was reached in 2004, and where the level has remained until present. Then, we analysed the PEP in 244 rabies cases collected in the Guangdong province in 2003 and 2004, and found that 67.2% of the patients did not seek medical services or did not receive any PEP. Further analysis of PEP for the 80 rabies patients who received any type of PEP indicated that almost all of the patients did not receive proper or timely treatment on the wounds or post-exposure vaccination or rabies immunoglobulins. CONCLUSION: While the issue of under-reporting of rabies in previous years may well be a factor in the apparent upwards trend of human rabies in recent years, the analysis of PEP in the Guangdong province provides evidence that suggests that the failure to receive PEP was a major factor in the number of human cases in China. Thus, the data underline the need for greatly improved availability and timely application of high-quality anti-rabies biologicals, both vaccines and immunoglobulins, in the treatment of human bite victims. Controlling dog rabies through pet vaccination schemes may also play a huge role in reducing the rate of human exposure. Education of the public, health care staff and veterinarians will also help to change the current situation.","publish_time":"2008-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Si, Han; Guo, Zhong-Min; Hao, Yuan-Tao; Liu, Yu-Ge; Zhang, Ding-Mei; Rao, Shao-Qi; Lu, Jia-Hai","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3df8818685d06d65f93674101b8ca899731efc36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2532688.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-8-113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18717989/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rabies"],"organizations":["PEP"],"locations":["China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["rabies patients","rabies immunoglobulins","dog rabies","post-exposure treatment of rabies","recent re-emergence of human rabies","current trends of human rabies","large number of human rabies cases","number of reported rabies cases","anti-rabies treatment of injuries","China","analysis of PEP","apparent upwards trend of human rabies","type of PEP","number of human cases","issue of under-reporting of rabies","PEP failures","rate of human exposure","timely application of high-quality anti-rabies biologicals","treatment of human bite victims","timely treatment","post-exposure vaccination","post-exposure prophylaxis","Guangdong province","major public-health problem","recent years","major factor","previous years","Ministry of Health","reasons","RESULTS","health care staff","updated epidemiological data","Guangdong provincial jurisdiction","epidemiological studies","large jump","incidence rate","previous reports","current situation","pet vaccination schemes","wounds","improved availability","related incidents","vaccines","schedules","developing countries","details","findings","little attention","need","veterinarians","huge role","evidence","surveillance database of reportable diseases","new peak","better recommendations","phenomenon","METHODS","Education","BACKGROUND","efficiency","control","medical services","CONCLUSION","people","risk factors","regimens","purpose","study","level","period"],"language":"en"},

Traditional vaccines against animal viral diseases are based on inactivated or attenuated viruses, but new subunit vaccines are gaining attention from researchers in animal vaccinology. Among these, virus-like particles (VLPs) represent one of the most appealing approaches opening up interesting frontiers in animal vaccines. VLPs are robust protein scaffolds exhibiting well-defined geometry and uniformity that mimic the overall structure of the native virions but lack the viral genome. They are often antigenically indistinguishable from the virus from which they were derived and present important advantages in terms of safety. VLPs can stimulate strong humoral and cellular immune responses and have been shown to exhibit self-adjuvanting abilities. In addition to their suitability as a vaccine for the homologous virus from which they are derived, VLPs can also be used as vectors for the multimeric presentation of foreign antigens. VLPs have therefore shown dramatic effectiveness as candidate vaccines; nevertheless, only one veterinary VLP-base vaccine is licensed. Here, we review and examine in detail the current status of VLPs as a vaccine strategy in the veterinary field, and discuss the potential advantages and challenges of this technology.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crisci, Elisa; B\u00E1rcena, Juan; Montoya, Mar\u00EDa","journal":"Inmunolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc16b666ad077c0384553e2d04d29128eed3b998.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115488.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S021396261200087X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S021396261200087X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inmuno.2012.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287712/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal vaccines","current status of VLPs","Traditional vaccines","candidate vaccines","veterinary field","animal viral diseases","new subunit vaccines","vaccine strategy","animal vaccinology","veterinary VLP-base vaccine","homologous virus","potential advantages","viral genome","present important advantages","uniformity","well-defined geometry","attention","robust protein scaffolds","attenuated viruses","native virions","interesting frontiers","researchers","overall structure","cellular immune responses","pathogens","terms of safety","vectors","dramatic effectiveness","multimeric presentation of foreign antigens","appealing approaches","challenges","technology","suitability","humans","effective ways","self-adjuvanting abilities","addition","particles","Abstract Vaccination"],"language":"en"},

A new generation of POC molecular tests that are highly sensitive and specific, robust and easy to use are now available for deployment in low resource settings. Decentralisation of testing outside of the laboratory can put tremendous stress on the healthcare system and presents challenges for training and quality assurance. A feature of many of these POC molecular devices is that they are equipped with data transmission capacities. In a digital age, it is possible to link data from diagnostic laboratories and POC test readers and devices to provide data on testing coverage, disease trends and timely information for early warning of infectious disease outbreaks to inform design or optimisation of disease control and elimination programmes. Data connectivity also allows control programmes to monitor the quality of tests and testing, and optimise supply chain management; thus, increasing the efficiency of healthcare systems and improving patient outcomes.","publish_time":"2015-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peeling, Rosanna W.","journal":"Int Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6fdc0a211ce9e0580ba484504ca9f69ba8ce8d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108565.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26553825/; https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihv062","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid point-of-care","POC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quality of testing","quality of tests","testing coverage","Decentralisation of testing","optimisation of disease control","POC molecular devices","disease trends","control programmes","Data connectivity","quality assurance","new generation of POC molecular tests","POC test readers","patient management","data transmission capacities","early warning of infectious disease outbreaks","infectious diseases","test results","elimination programmes","patient outcomes","efficiency of healthcare systems","supply chain management","timely information","diagnostic laboratories","clinical decision making","access","design","critical role","challenges","training","surveillance","diagnosis","deployment","low resource settings","tremendous stress","laboratory","Diagnostics","mechanisms","Rapid point","digital age","feature","prevention"],"language":"en"},

A number of variants with deletions and mutations in the S protein have been isolated from naturally and persistently infected animals and tissue cultures. Here, we report the emergence and isolation of two temperature sensitive (ts) mutants and a revertant in the process of cold-adaptation of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to a monkey kidney cell line. The complete sequences of wild type (wt) virus, two ts mutants, and the revertant were compared and variations linked to phenotypes were mapped. A single amino acid reversion (L294-to-Q) in the S protein is sufficient to abrogate the ts phenotype. Interestingly, unlike wt virus, the revertant grows well at and below 32 \u00B0C, the permissive temperature, as it carries other mutations in multiple genes that might be associated with the cold-adaptation phenotype. If the two ts mutants were allowed to enter cells at 32 \u00B0C, the S protein was synthesized, core-glycosylated and at least partially modified at 40 \u00B0C. However, compared with wt virus and the revertant, no infectious particles of these ts mutants were assembled and released from the ts mutant-infected cells at 40 \u00B0C. Evidence presented demonstrated that the Q294-to-L294 mutation, located at a highly conserved domain of the S1 subunit, might hamper processing of the S protein to a matured 180-kDa, endo-glycosidase H-resistant glycoprotein and the translocation of the protein to the cell surface. Consequently, some essential functions of the S protein, including mediation of cell-to-cell fusion and its incorporation into virions, were completely abolished.","publish_time":"2004-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shen, S; Law, Y.

We documented cases of MERS-CoV infection, confirmed by real-time PCR testing of sputum samples. We analysed attack rates, incubation periods of the virus, and risk factors for transmission. FINDINGS: 675 patients and 218 health-care workers were identified as contacts. MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in 82 individuals (33 patients, eight health-care workers, and 41 visitors). The attack rate was highest in group A (20% [23/117] vs 5% [3/58] in group B vs 1% [4/500] in group C; p\u003C0\u00B70001), and was 2% (5/218) in health-care workers. After excluding nine cases (because of inability to determine the date of symptom onset in six cases and lack of data from three visitors), the median incubation period was 7 days (range 2\u201317, IQR 5\u201310). The median incubation period was significantly shorter in group A than in group C (5 days [IQR 4\u20138] vs 11 days [6\u201312]; p\u003C0\u00B70001). There were no confirmed cases in patients and visitors who visited the emergency room on May 29 and who were exposed only to potentially contaminated environment without direct contact with the index case. The main risk factor for transmission of MERS-CoV was the location of exposure. INTERPRETATION: Our results showed increased transmission potential of MERS-CoV from a single patient in an overcrowded emergency room and provide compelling evidence that health-care facilities worldwide need to be prepared for emerging infectious diseases.

While the lungs are the primary target for the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathological consequence, SARS-CoV-2 appear to invade the brain and cause neurological deficits. In the later stage, COVID-19 can progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, neurological deficits and multi-organ dysfunctions leading to death. Though a significant portion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals has been recovering from pathological symptoms, the impact of the COVID-19 on the structural and functional properties of the lungs, heart, brain and other organs at the post-recovery state remains unknown. Presently, there is an urgent need for a remedial measure to combat this devastating COVID-19. Botulinum toxins (BoNTs) are potent neurotoxins that can induce paralysis of muscle and acute respiratory arrest in human. However, a mild dose of the purified form of BoNT has been known to attenuate chronic cough, dyspnoea, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, abnormal circulation, cardiac defects and various neurological deficits that have been recognised as the prominent clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Considering the fact, this review article provides 1) an overview on the SARS-CoV-2 mediated pathological impact on the lungs, heart and brain, 2) signifies the therapeutic uses of BoNTs against pulmonary failure, cardiac arrest and neurological deficits, and 3) emphasize the rationality for the possible use of BoNT to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and manage COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kandasamy, Mahesh","journal":"Med Drug Discov","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6faf980201d8a3c364e46ee8ff5bf44d60bdf55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189194.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590098620300294; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590098620300294?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352081/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medidd.2020.100042","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","acute respiratory failure","devastating COVID","acute respiratory arrest","various neurological deficits","lungs","brain","prominent clinical symptoms of COVID","significant portion of SARS","pathological symptoms","mediated pathological impact","distinctive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","pulmonary failure","cardiac arrest","pneumonia","heart","pathological consequence","cardiac defects","life-threatening clinical issues","therapeutic uses of BoNTs","purified form of BoNT","possible use of BoNT","recent outbreak of coronavirus disease","abnormal circulation","paralysis of muscle","multi-organ dysfunctions","dyspnoea","potent neurotoxins","global public health","remedial measure","organs","post-recovery state","infected individuals","chronic cough","functional properties","overview","human","primary target","mild dose","Botulinum toxins","review article","urgent need","death","rationality","countries","infection","fact","later stage"],"language":"en"},

To date, few reports have addressed the prevalence of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adults with ARTIs attending an emergency department (ED). Therefore, the potential impact of respiratory virus infections on such patients remains unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine the epidemiological and clinical profiles of common and recently discovered respiratory viruses in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in Beijing, a 1-year consecutive study was conducted from May, 2010, to April, 2011. Nose and throat swab samples from 416 ARTI patients were checked for 13 respiratory viruses using multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) assays for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (Flu) A, B, and adenoviruses (ADVs), picornaviruses (PICs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1\u20133, combined with real-time RT-PCR for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs, -OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1). Viral pathogens were detected in 52.88% (220/416) of patient samples, and 7.21% (30/416) of patients tested positive for more than one virus. PICs (17.79%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by FluA (16.11%), HCoVs (11.78%), and ADV (11.30%). HMPV, PIVs, and FluB were also detected (\u003C3%), but not RSV. The total prevalence and the dominant virus infections detected differed significantly between ours and a previous report. Co-infection rates were high for HCoV-229E (12/39, 30.76%), PIC (22/74, 29.73%), ADV (12/47, 25.53%) and FluA (15/67, 22.39%). Different patterns of clinical symptoms were associated with different respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of RV involvement in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in China differs from that previously reported. The high prevalence of viruses (PIC, FluA, HCoVs and ADV) reported here strongly highlight the need for the development of safe and effective therapeutic approaches for these viruses.","publish_time":"2012-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Xiaoyan; Lu, Roujian; Wang, Zhong; Zhu, Na; Wang, Wen; Julian, Druce; Chris, Birch; Lv, Jianxin; Tan, Wenjie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2615e2f1b1e1de90023706bf99405151406bbd8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3289638.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22389685/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0032174","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs4NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["ADV","RSV","RV"],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["prevalence of respiratory viruses","common respiratory viruses","different respiratory viruses","parainfluenza viruses","high prevalence of viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","ARTIs","potential impact of respiratory virus infections","Acute respiratory tract infections","adults","dominant virus infections","HCoVs","FluA","HMPV","ARTI patients","total prevalence","RSV","PICs","PIVs","real-time RT-PCR","clinical profiles of common","human metapneumovirus","human coronaviruses","Different patterns of clinical symptoms","dominant agents","patient samples","throat swab samples","multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","assays","development of safe","effective therapeutic approaches","picornaviruses","pattern of RV involvement","RVs","ADVs","Co-infection rates","serious global health burden","Beijing","OC43","BACKGROUND","emergency department","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","adenoviruses","CONCLUSIONS","Nose","reports","year consecutive study","METHODOLOGY","need","NL63","FluB","China","previous report","Viral pathogens","HKU1","date"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of pneumonia etiology among immunocompetent young adults admitted to Daejeon Armed Forces hospital. Patient blood and sputum samples were subjected to conventional culture, serology, and polymerase chain reaction tests for respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens. RESULTS: From January to May 2015, we enrolled 191 (189 male) adults with pneumonia; the mean age was 20.1 \u00B1 1.3 years. Five patients had severe pneumonia, and one died. Pathogenic human adenoviruses were most common (HAdV, 153/191 [80.1%]), indicating a HAdV pneumonia outbreak. Genotyping of 35 isolates indicated that 34 matched HAdV-55 and one matched HAdV-2. HAdV pneumonia infected recruit trainees most frequently. High and prolonged fever, nasal congestion, sore throat, and pharyngeal inflammation were significantly more common in the HAdV pneumonia group, compared to patients with other or unknown causes of pneumonia. Only 12% of HAdV pneumonia patients displayed leukocytosis, whereas febrile leukopenia (62.7%) and thrombocytopenia (41%) were commonly observed. HAdV pneumonia patient chest CT scans displayed ground glass opacity (with or without septal thickness) with consolidation in 50.0% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: An outbreak of HAdV respiratory infection occurred at the Korean military training center. HAdV pneumonia exhibited specific laboratory and clinical features, and although most patients were cured without complication, some progressed to respiratory failure and fatality. Therefore, HAdV vaccine should be provided to military trainees in Korea.","publish_time":"2017-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Ji Young; Kim, Bong-Joon; Lee, Eun Jung; Park, Kwi Sung; Park, Hee Sun; Jung, Sung Soo; Kim, Ju Ock","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ebf5c3f42606a62d8bb4c03fa96623d0e2a56408.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5256920.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0170592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28114362/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Daejeon Armed Forces"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["HAdV pneumonia patients","HAdV pneumonia outbreak","HAdV pneumonia group","matched HAdV","severe pneumonia","number of pneumonia patients","HAdV vaccine","HAdV pneumonia infected recruit trainees","HAdV pneumonia patient chest CT scans","outbreak of HAdV respiratory infection","unknown causes of pneumonia","prospective study of pneumonia etiology","military trainees","respiratory viruses","respiratory failure","Korean military hospitals","Korean military training center","epidemic outbreak investigation","Patient blood","immunocompetent young adults","polymerase chain reaction tests","ground glass opacity","nasal congestion","sore throat","serology","prolonged fever","conventional culture","clinical features","Daejeon Armed Forces hospital","sputum samples","specific laboratory","leukocytosis","pharyngeal inflammation","urgent need","atypical pathogens","febrile leukopenia","mean age","Pathogenic human adenoviruses","septal thickness","consolidation","isolates","complication","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","years","METHODS","fatality","male","Genotyping","thrombocytopenia","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

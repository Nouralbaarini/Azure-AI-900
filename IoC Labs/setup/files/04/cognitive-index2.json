This includes early identification of PUIs, institution of appropriate transmission-based precautions including use of specific personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolation, and prompt notification of relevant personnel, including relevant experts and authorities. Depending on the specific infection suspected, once appropriate infection control measures have been implemented, clinical evaluation of PUIs can vary in complexity. In the case of Ebola virus disease (EVD), the need for specialized PPE and training, well-developed procedures, and dedicated space can be extremely resource-intensive and costly for facilities. In addition, depending upon the need to reduce risks to other patients and HCWs, regular laboratory and imaging equipment may not be available (or available at the standard frequency or turnaround time) to support medical care. Lastly, diagnostic tests needed to confirm the diagnosis may not be available at the healthcare facility and may instead be accessible through public health authorities. This testing may take several days to confirm the diagnosis or rule out the presence of the suspected infection. Thus, the potential period of evaluation for a PUI can extend well beyond a typical clinic or emergency department (ED) visit. Thoughtful and coordinated planning efforts are required across the community and across the hospital to be able to adequately care for the PUI.","publish_time":"2018-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Biddinger, Paul D.; Shenoy, Erica S.","journal":"Bioemergency Planning","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce2f6998c15a563f2976f5654c975226b5b019b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123748.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123748/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["PPE","PUI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","specific infection","suspected infection","specific infectious disease","HCWs","need","clinical evaluation of PUIs","diagnosis","effective care","medical care","use of specific personal protective equipment","appropriate infection control measures","present risks of transmission","case of infectious diseases","specialized PPE","imaging equipment","relevant experts","healthcare workers","case of Ebola virus disease","healthcare facility","institution of appropriate transmission-based precautions","early identification of PUIs","potential period of evaluation","public health authorities","prompt notification of relevant personnel","well-developed procedures","training","EVD","isolation","epidemiological risk factors","turnaround time","emergency department","dedicated space","regular laboratory","resource-intensive","typical clinic","standard frequency","delivery of safe","staff","coordinated planning efforts","community","facilities","framework","visit","isolate","presence","hospital","days","diagnostic tests","investigation","complexity","testing","addition"],"language":"en"},

Food distribution is a complex system that can be seen as a network of trade flows connecting supply chain actors. Identifying the source of an outbreak of foodborne disease distributed across this network can be solved by considering this network structure and the dimensions of information it contains. The literature on the network source identification problem has grown widely in recent years covering problems in many different contexts, from contagious disease infecting a human population, to computer viruses spreading through the Internet, to rumors or trends diffusing through a social network. Much of this work has focused on studying this problem in analytically tractable frameworks, designing approaches to work on trees and extending to general network structures in an ad hoc manner. These simplified frameworks lack many features of real-world networks and problem contexts that can dramatically impact transmission dynamics, and therefore, backwards inference of the transmission process. Moreover, the features that distinguish foodborne disease in the context of source identification have not previously been studied or identified. In this article we identify these features, then provide a review of existing work on the network source identification problem, categorizing approaches according to these features. We conclude that much of the existing work cannot be implemented in the foodborne disease problem because it makes assumptions about the transmission process that are unrealistic in the context of food supply networks\u2014that is, identifying the source of an epidemic contagion whereas foodborne contamination spreads through a transport network-mediated diffusion process, or because it requires data that is not available\u2014complete observations of the contamination status of all nodes in the network.","publish_time":"2019-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horn, Abigail L.; Friedrich, Hanno","journal":"Dynamics On and Of Complex Networks III","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42e54a24a0fee292137d480dd94d3bb8819483d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123770.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["network source identification problem","foodborne disease problem","social network","outbreaks of foodborne disease","outbreak of foodborne disease","network of trade flows","general network structures","problem contexts","context of source identification","contagious disease","transport network-mediated diffusion process","transmission process","foodborne contamination spreads","features of real-world networks","review of existing work","context of food supply networks","interconnected food system","approaches","Food distribution","transmission dynamics","different contexts","contamination status","complex system","tractable frameworks","simplified frameworks","considerable impact","supply chain actors","human population","recent years","epidemic contagion","trees","assumptions","complete observations","backwards inference","computer viruses","problems","today\u2019s","literature","Internet","public health","data","trends","dimensions of information","manner","nodes","article"],"language":"en"},

The ancient Greeks and Romans described plagues of unknown origin. In general, infections were blamed on sins and punishment, balances of \u201Cvital humors\u201D or on \u201Cmiasma,\u201D (rotten smells). In the sixteenth century, Girolamo Fracastoro suggested that infectious agents might spread disease, as did Agostino Bassi, studying diseases of silkworms. The development of the microscope by Hook and Van Leeuwenhoek in the seventeenth century led to the discovery of a new living world inhabited by very small creatures. Edward Jenner in England demonstrated that smallpox, a dreaded disease, could be prevented by inoculation with an organism that caused pockmarks on cows and dairymaids; this was the beginning of the concept of vaccination. Louis Pasteur proved that fermentation only occurred in the presence of air and was due to microorganisms. Pasteur and Pierre Roux, a colleague, as well as Jacob Henle and Robert Koch, proved that germs caused bacterial diseases such as anthrax and tuberculosis; Pasteur and Roux developed a vaccine against rabies by passaging the infectious material through rabbits. By the end of the nineteenth century it had been established that most infectious diseases were the result of germs. In parallel with this research, plant scientists had isolated material that passed through a low pore filter that was infectious to tobacco plants. This was called a \u201Cvirus,\u201D from the Latin for poison. Viruses were also found to be associated with leukemia and other cancers of chickens. The twentieth century saw the discovery of bacteriophage, viruses that attack bacteria, and the use of such bacteriophage to launch studies of molecular biology, and DNA and RNA structure.","publish_time":"2014-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taylor, Milton W.","journal":"Viruses and Man: A History of Interactions","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1029e3cb9bdda3a1d47fe1023075a7edfca6c9ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123787.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123787/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Agostino Bassi","Van Leeuwenhoek","Edward Jenner","Pierre Roux","Roux","Robert Koch"],"organizations":["Romans"],"locations":["England"],"keyphrases":["century","infectious diseases","infectious material","infectious agents","bacterial diseases","discovery of bacteriophage","diseases of silkworms","Louis Pasteur","Viruses","beginning of recorded history","isolated material","Pierre Roux","result of germs","dreaded disease","Viral infections","anthrax","studies of molecular biology","Romans","DNA","smallpox","punishment","research","plant scientists","colleague","low pore filter","tuberculosis","new living world","Robert Koch","miasma","pockmarks","England","microscope","Hook","plagues of unknown origin","vital humors","balances","Jacob Henle","sins","Van Leeuwenhoek","Agostino Bassi","Girolamo Fracastoro","rabies","vaccine","ancient Greeks","small creatures","RNA structure","tobacco plants","cows","Edward Jenner","dairymaids","inoculation","fermentation","Latin","leukemia","cancers of chickens","presence of air","rotten smells","development","concept of vaccination","rabbits","poison","microorganisms","end"],"language":"en"},

It is important to understand that ethical considerations related to health care ethics and those that pertain to public health are often seen from different perspectives. In public health, decisions are made within a context and a framework through principles which guide action that affect communities and populations. These decisions and actions are made with and involve, stakeholders to include: traditional, community and religious leaders; government officials; and private and commercial stake holders. The underlying principles of both public health ethics and bioethics are the same, namely equality, justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, veracity and fidelity. Health care ethics supports the rights of individuals. Under the same umbrella of health care ethics are medical ethics, clinical ethics and research ethics. These disciplines offer views that support the rights of individuals. Ethics in public health is very complex with a myriad of issues to include diverse groups of people in different situations, which have to be taken into account from the view of what is best for the population.

Moreover, availability of accurate and efficient validation tools would help molecular biologists and computational chemists to evaluate quality of available experimental structures and to select a protein model which is the most suitable for a given scientific problem. The (13)C(\u03B1) nuclei are ubiquitous in proteins, moreover, their shieldings are easily obtainable from NMR experiments and represent a rich source of encoded structural information that makes (13)C(\u03B1) chemical shifts an attractive candidate for use in computational methods aimed at determination and validation of protein structures. In this chapter, the basis of a novel methodology of computing, at the quantum chemical level of theory, the (13)C(\u03B1) shielding for the amino acid residues in proteins is described. We also identify and examine the main factors affecting the (13)C(\u03B1)-shielding computation.

Acute liver failure is the common final pathway of a multitude of conditions and insults, all of which result in massive hepatic necrosis or loss of normal hepatic function. The ensuing multiorgan system failure frequently has a fatal outcome, with mortality rates in most series ranging from approximately 55% to 95% [1]. Acute liver failure (ALF, previously often referred to as fulminant hepatic failure (FHF)) knows no age boundaries, with many cases occurring in those younger than 30 years. Short of excellent intensive care unit (ICU) support and liver transplantation in selected cases, few viable treatment options are available. Over the past few decades, however, survival has been improved by anticipation, recognition, and early treatment of associated complications, as well as the application of prognostic criteria for early identification of patients requiring liver transplantation (along with improvement in the techniques and science of transplantation itself). The etiology of ALF varies from country to country and the incidence change over time. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has now replaced viral hepatitis as the leading cause of ALF [2]. In a study from London including 310 patients with ALF in the period 1994\u20132004, 42% of the cases were caused by paracetamol [3], whereas this was only the cause in 2% of 267 patients in Spain from 1992 to 2000 [4].

This has led to different approaches and guidelines for the empiric treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, often with broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents which may play a role in fostering the worldwide development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Severe community-acquired pneumonia, seen mainly at the extremes of age and in persons with chronic underlying diseases, is associated with high mortality of 20\u201340%. Pneumonia severity tools, such as CURB-65, have been developed over the past decade to assist emergency department physicians to recognize, admit, and implement rapid antimicrobial therapy in severely ill patients.

Knowledge of the pathogen involved also allow implementation of infection control and monitoring of success of antiviral treatments that may affect the prognosis of patients. Epidemiological data collected through accurate diagnostics play an important role in public health through identification and control of outbreaks, implementation of appropriate diagnostic tests, vaccination programs and treatment but also to recognize common and emerging pathogens in a community. It is key that the clinician have an understanding of appropriate specimens to send to the laboratory and the value of specific nucleic acid and serological testing for different viral pathogens. Molecular techniques have revolutionized viral diagnoses over the past decade and enhanced both the sensitivity and specificity of tests and the speed by which a diagnosis can be made and new tests be developed. The continued use of serology for viruses with a short viremia, or for chronic infections should however complement these tests. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the available tests, the principles of testing and appropriate tests to select for different viruses and syndromes. Also provided is a glimpse of new developments in diagnostics that may further enhance the capacity to make a conclusive diagnosis in the near future.","publish_time":"2017-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pretorius, Marthi; Venter, Marietjie","journal":"Viral Infections in Children, Volume I","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2c9e554840108b0faf1542b2503fb5f873e94cd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120824.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120824/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["appropriate tests","new tests","available tests","specificity of tests","implementation of appropriate diagnostic tests","appropriate treatment of patients","Accurate diagnosis of viral infections","different viral pathogens","understanding of appropriate specimens","viral diagnoses","different viruses","accurate diagnostics","clinician","conclusive diagnosis","implementation of infection control","serological testing","control of outbreaks","principles of testing","chronic infections","emerging pathogens","prognosis of patients","glimpse of new developments","identification","value of specific nucleic acid","public health","important role","monitoring of success","disease progression","vaccination programs","laboratory","short viremia","decisions","ability","antiviral treatments","past decade","sensitivity","continued use of serology","misuse of antibiotics","community","near future","Molecular techniques","Epidemiological data","overview","capacity","speed","syndromes","Knowledge","chapter"],"language":"en"},

By destabilizing the relationship between plant and human, Wyndham and Christopher open up a space to reconsider the vegetal as a distinct life form itself, beyond its instrumental use-value, or as an anthropomorphized reflection of human thought. Although plant life is traditionally defined by its inability to move or to speak, both writers suggest that communication bound to the visual or oral is highly limited (for instance, human sight is confined to a limited spectrum). In Wyndham\u2019s The Day of the Triffids (1951) plants become mobile and seemingly sentient, in the process becoming an invasive presence that exposes and challenges the limits of anthropocentric thought. By contrast, in Christopher\u2019s The Death of Grass (1956), the absence of the vegetal renders manifest the subaltern status of plant life, while suggesting that plants are able to communicate through their materiality and posture. Both texts signal that what is conventionally understood as Other is actually a blank repository that ventriloquizes humans\u2019 unconscious desire. Following the population\u2019s sudden loss of sight in The Day of the Triffids, the characters begin to project their own thoughts and emotions onto the triffids, which highlights the indeterminate limits of anthropomorphic representation. The Death of Grass demonstrates that such anthropocentrism constitutes an act of metaphysical violence that, at the same time, under-imagines plant life and installs specialist terminology and botanical classification as a substitute. Presenting the relationship between plant life and human life as a contested space, these texts manifest the problem of anthropocentric certainties and the absolute alterity of plant-thought.","publish_time":"2016-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Matthews, Graham J.","journal":"Plant Horror","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8619941808843a49e7523239515c0f852f5dc20f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120846.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120846/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["John Wyndham","John Beynon Harris","John Christopher","Christopher","Sam Youd"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human life","under-imagines plant life","subaltern status of plant life","human sight","Triffids","distinct life form","absolute alterity of plant","John Wyndham","John Christopher","anthropomorphized reflection of human thought","fate of human civilization","limits of anthropocentric thought","vegetal renders","Day","relationship","plants","Death of Grass","John Beynon Harris","contested space","limited spectrum","texts signal","problem of anthropocentric certainties","British science fiction writers","population\u2019s sudden loss of sight","indeterminate limits of anthropomorphic representation","rising tide of urbanization","specialist terminology","Sam Youd","post-apocalyptic scenarios","anthropocentrism","pseudonym","time","face of continuing post-war reconstruction","botanical classification","blank repository","humans\u2019 unconscious desire","oral","instance","instrumental use-value","act of metaphysical violence","process","substitute","communication","thoughts","Christopher\u2019s","characters","absence","invasive presence","materiality","contrast","emotions","Wyndham\u2019s","posture","inability"],"language":"en"},

Neutropenia is the primary risk factor associated with the development of infection, with the severity and frequency of infection increasing as the absolute neutrophil count drops below 500 cells/mm(3), as initially described by Bodey and colleagues. Other risk factors may be present including impaired cellular or humoral immunity, breakdown of normal barriers such as the skin and mucosal surfaces, and vascular access catheters and other foreign medical devices. Multiple risk factors are often present in the same patient. Additionally, the frequent use of antimicrobial agents for various indications (prophylaxis, empiric therapy, pre-emptive administration, specific or targeted therapy, and occasionally maintenance or suppressive therapy) has an impact on the nature and spectrum of infections, with the emergence/selection of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms being of particular concern. Bacterial infections tend to occur early on in a neutropenic episode, with fungal infections being uncommon at this stage. If neutropenia persists, the risk for fungal infections increases. There are periodic changes in the epidemiology/spectrum of infection in patients with leukemia. It is important to conduct periodic epidemiologic and susceptibility/resistance surveys, especially at institutions dealing with large numbers of such patients, in order to detect these shifts and changes in susceptibility/resistance patterns, since empiric therapy is largely based on this information. Such surveys are conducted every 3\u20135 years at our institution.","publish_time":"2014-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rolston, Kenneth V.

The disease is prevalent in all countries with almost 100% incidence rate. Chicken and commercially reared pheasant are the natural host for IBV. Virus causes respiratory diseases, poor weight gain, feed efficiency in broiler, damage to oviduct, and abnormal egg production in mature hens resulting in economic losses. IBV also replicates in tracheal and renal epithelial cells leading to prominent tracheal and kidney lesions. Virus undergoes spontaneous mutation leading to continual emergence of new variants. The effectiveness of immunization program is diminished because of poor cross-protection among the serotypes. Identification of circulating serotypes is important in controlling IBV infection. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR21 are involved in early recognition of virus resulting in induction of inflammatory cytokines. Both humoral and cellular immune responses are important in the control of infection. Humoral immunity plays an important role in recovery and clearance of viral infection. IBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes induce lysis of IBV-infected cells. Effective diagnostic tools are required at field level to identify different IBV variants. Embryonated chicken eggs are effective model for virus isolation. Identification by other specific methods like virus neutralization (VN), hemagglutination inhibition (HI), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, or nucleic acid analysis or by electron microscopy is also indispensable. VN test in tracheal organ culture is the best method for antigenic typing for surveillance purposes. Continuous epidemiological surveillance, strict biosecurity measures, and vaccine effective against various serotypes are necessary for controlling IB in chickens.","publish_time":"2019-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramakrishnan, Saravanan; Kappala, Deepthi","journal":"Recent Advances in Animal Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7d81667e00421f759a1353afa36e45a2ee44292.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120852.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120852/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IB","IBV","Toll-like","VN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV infection","lysis of IBV","virus neutralization","virus isolation","different IBV variants","avian infectious bronchitis virus","early recognition of virus","IBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes","vaccine effective","effective model","important role","various serotypes","Identification of circulating serotypes","control of infection","tracheal organ culture","Effective diagnostic tools","clearance of viral infection","VN test","specific methods","surveillance purposes","infected cells","Humoral immunity","poor weight gain","Continuous epidemiological surveillance","poor cross-protection","renal epithelial cells","Embryonated chicken eggs","continual emergence of new variants","best method","strict biosecurity measures","feed efficiency","field level","mature hens","immunohistochemistry","enzyme","abnormal egg production","oviduct","damage","broiler","recovery","antigenic typing","hemagglutination inhibition","respiratory diseases","nucleic acid analysis","electron microscopy","ELISA","immunosorbent assay","cellular immune responses","reared pheasant","spontaneous mutation","countries","TLR21","natural host","induction of inflammatory cytokines","economic losses","kidney lesions","effectiveness of immunization program","receptor","TLR3","Coronaviridae family"],"language":"en"},

At present, there are no true curative treatments that can stop the progression of the disease, and new therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. Advances in cell-based therapies provide a platform for the development of new therapeutic approaches in severe lung diseases such as COPD. At present, a lot of focus is on mesenchymal stem (stromal) cell (MSC)-based therapies, mainly due to their immunomodulatory properties. Despite increasing number of preclinical studies demonstrating that systemic MSC administration can prevent or treat experimental COPD and emphysema, clinical studies have not been able to reproduce the preclinical results and to date no efficacy or significantly improved lung function or quality of life has been observed in COPD patients. Importantly, the completed appropriately conducted clinical trials uniformly demonstrate that MSC treatment in COPD patients is well tolerated and no toxicities have been observed. All clinical trials performed so far, have been phase I/II studies, underpowered for the detection of potential efficacy. There are several challenges ahead for this field such as standardized isolation and culture procedures to obtain a cell product with high quality and reproducibility, administration strategies, improvement of methods to measure outcomes, and development of potency assays. Moreover, COPD is a complex pathology with a diverse spectrum of clinical phenotypes, and therefore it is essential to develop methods to select the subpopulation of patients that is most likely to potentially respond to MSC administration. In this chapter, we will discuss the current state of the art of MSC-based cell therapy for COPD and the hurdles that need to be overcome.","publish_time":"2019-08-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Enes, Sara Rolandsson; Uriarte, Juan J.; Pouliot, Robert A.; Weiss, Daniel J.","journal":"Stem Cell-Based Therapy for Lung Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eea3edb615fb9bfef4c43baec6c224141dc9b2d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121219.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121219/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","MSC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD patients","experimental COPD","art of MSC","MSC treatment","cell-based therapies","systemic MSC administration","clinical trials","based cell therapy","cell product","administration strategies","new therapeutic strategies","number of preclinical studies","subpopulation of patients","present","development of new therapeutic approaches","diverse spectrum of clinical phenotypes","progressive life-threatening disease","high quality","quality of life","improvement of methods","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","preclinical results","severe lung diseases","improved lung function","development of potency assays","detection of potential efficacy","reproducibility","platform","culture procedures","mesenchymal stem","outcomes","lot of focus","complex pathology","field","standardized isolation","progression","emphysema","current state","true curative treatments","hurdles","Advances","leading cause of death","immunomodulatory properties","challenges","chapter","toxicities","prevalence"],"language":"en"},

They attach and replicate in the susceptible and permissive hosts and host derived cell lines. They enter the cells either through direct attachment, receptor-mediated endocytosis, or phagocytosis. Hence, to thwart the invasion by viruses, hosts have developed immunity in ascending stages\u2014intrinsic, innate and adaptive immunity. A robust intrinsic and innate immune response governs an effective adaptive immune response, should that be needed. Both enveloped as well as non-enveloped viruses are subject to distinct types of DNA sensors, subject to their site of replication. DNA sensors of viral PAMPs can be classified into three types, based on the location of their PAMPs in the host cellular compartment viz. cell surface, cytoplasmic and nuclear. The host cell membrane both, surface as well as intra cellular, is continuously monitored for the non-host, pathogenic components or PAMPs. Among the intracellular sensors of the viral genome, there are two types\u2014essentially due to the two types of major viral genomes i.e. RNA and DNA sensors. The cytosolic DNA sensors include AIM2, IFI16, cGAS, RNA Pol III, DNA-PK, DDX9, DHX36, DDX41, DDX60, DAI, LRRFIP1, HMGB, ABCF1 and MRE11. PYHIN family of sensors include AIM2, IFI16, IFIX and MNDA. Another recently discovered family of sensor called stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), specifically houses on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and functions in association with its upstream sensor, cGAS. Some DNA sensors shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus pre- and post-extraneous DNA binding. These include IFI16, IFIX, RNA Pol III, etc. There is no exclusive nuclear DNA sensor. Many enzymes known to be present in the cells for their obvious primary functions also additionally function as DNA sensors. The DNAse family of sensors include DNAse II and TREX1, which are ubiquitously present in the cell for their housekeeping functions. The RNAse family of sensor includes one member\u2014RNA Pol III. Additionally, DNA-PK also functions to cater to viral DNA sensing. The endosomal DNA sensors include TLR7 and TLR9, which belong to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. The DExD/H-box helicase family include the putative DNA sensors recently discovered including DDX9, DHX36, DDX41 and DDX60. Several other sensors remain to be characterised or are less classified viz. DAI, LRRFIP1, HMGB, ABCF1, MRE11. In general, response to a viral RNA or DNA produces three types of responses, namely, production of antiviral cytokines including Types I and III IFNs, release of pro-inflammatory and inflammatory cytokines and chemotactic factors. This chapter discusses the structure, function and mechanism of action of the viral DNA sensors explored till date.","publish_time":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sapre, Siddhesh U.; Nair, Preethika","journal":"Dynamics of Immune Activation in Viral Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1751472c47a2b0f7d9c559a6ed41aa8db53dadf1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pol III","DAI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral DNA sensors","putative DNA sensors","endosomal DNA sensors","cytosolic DNA sensors","DNA sensors of viral PAMPs","distinct types of DNA sensors","DNA-PK","intracellular sensors","viral DNA sensing","DNAse family of sensors","PYHIN family of sensors","viral RNA","exclusive nuclear DNA sensor","post-extraneous DNA binding","RNA Pol","discovered family of sensor","host cell machinery","host cell membrane","RNAse family of sensor","cell surface","non-host","types of major viral genomes","types of responses","host derived cell lines","IFI16","host cellular compartment","upstream sensor","housekeeping functions","innate immune response","non-enveloped viruses","H-box helicase family","subject","inflammatory cytokines","AIM2","LRRFIP1","effective adaptive immune response","DDX9","HMGB","DAI","DHX36","DDX60","DDX41","cGAS","adaptive immunity","ABCF1","cells","obvious primary functions","IFIX","MRE11","permissive hosts","intra cellular","release of pro-inflammatory","receptor-mediated endocytosis","production of antiviral cytokines","obligatory intracellular parasites","nucleus pre-","stimulator of interferon","mechanism of action","direct attachment","identical copies","IFNs","association","TLR9","member","chemotactic factors","ascending stages","genes","structure","DExD","pathogenic components","TLR7","STING","Toll","phagocytosis","endoplasmic reticulum","MNDA","site of replication","TREX1","location","date","self-propagation","chapter","invasion","enzymes"],"language":"en"},

Incorporation of cargo glycoproteins into transport vesicles is mediated by transmembrane cargo receptors, which have been identified as intracellular lectins.

With the evidence of organ failure, it was called severe sepsis, and this could lead to hypotension (septic shock). However, with the deep understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis, sepsis has been known as both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Additionally, the classic use of SIRS could lead to overestimation of sepsis. For example, usual common cold could be identified as sepsis in classic definition. With this background, new sepsis definition, Sepsis 3, was introduced and sepsis was defined as a \u201Clife-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.\u201D The management of sepsis has been changed dramatically, with the development of Surviving Sepsis Campaign, which substantially increased the survival of sepsis. However, this is not with the help of a new drug, but the implementation of a treatment system. Unfortunately, no specific drug for sepsis has survived in clinical use even though many candidate drugs have been successfully investigated in preclinical setting, and this leads to the new approach to the sepsis.","publish_time":"2018-08-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Kyuseok; Choi, Han Sung; Chung, Sung Phil; Kwon, Woon Young","journal":"Essentials of Shock Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a4de4dcbd9d7f4090586d1df7e216608fd0625d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121676.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121676/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathophysiology of sepsis","severe sepsis","overestimation of sepsis","survival of sepsis","management of sepsis","new sepsis definition","development of Surviving Sepsis Campaign","new drug","new approach","classic use of SIRS","classic definition","systemic inflammatory response syndrome","dysregulated host response","clinical use","microorganism infection","specific drug","life-threatening organ dysfunction","evidence of organ failure","leads","implementation","background","candidate drugs","example","deep understanding","symptoms","preclinical setting","hypotension","septic shock","treatment system","help","anti-inflammatory","years"],"language":"en"},

Mortality remains high ranging from 20 % for sepsis to over 50 % for septic shock despite almost 20 years of anti-inflammatory clinical trials [1\u20133]. The inability of these therapies to mitigate the devastating effects of this condition indicates that the initial hypotheses for sepsis pathophysiology may have been misconstrued or inadequately addressed. Two major explanations have been proposed: 1) Septic patients have mainly been treated as a group despite the extreme heterogeneity characterizing this population [1]; 2) The postulate that death after sepsis is solely due to an overwhelming pro-inflammatory immune response may actually be inaccurate [1, 3]. Indeed, several lines of evidence have now established that death from septic shock is probably due to the effect of distinct mechanisms over time [1\u20133]. Early in the course of the disease, a massive release of inflammatory mediators (normally designed to trigger an immune response against pathogens) is occurring that may be responsible for organ dysfunction and hypoperfusion [1, 3]. Concomitantly, the body develops compensatory mechanisms to prevent overwhelming inflammation and dampen an overzealous anti-infectious response [1\u20133]. These negative feedback mechanisms, although having protective effects during the first initial hours, may paradoxically become deleterious as they persist over time leading to immune paralysis (Fig. 1) [1, 3]. Indeed, considerable clinical and experimental evidence indicates that patients rapidly present with numerous compromised immune functions [1, 3].","publish_time":"2010-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Venet, F.; Lepape, A.; Monneret, G.","journal":"Intensive Care Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/48739ec6eacac9d786d3270a3ed37e2b827c982b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121891/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Septic patients","septic shock","immune paralysis","Septic syndromes","overwhelming pro-inflammatory immune response","compensatory mechanisms","sepsis pathophysiology","numerous compromised immune functions","negative feedback mechanisms","effect of distinct mechanisms","overwhelming inflammation","protective effects","initial hours","initial hypotheses","overzealous anti-infectious response","experimental evidence","devastating effects","time leading","major explanations","lines of evidence","massive release of inflammatory mediators","years of anti-inflammatory clinical trials","under-recognized healthcare problem","thousands of deaths","disease","condition","extreme heterogeneity","organ dysfunction","hypoperfusion","therapies","high ranging","body","population","group","Mortality","course","postulate","pathogens","inability"],"language":"en"},

The new curriculum encourages teachers to conduct scientific investigations in their classes, advocates scientific investigation as a desired means of learning scientific knowledge, and highlights the development of inquiry practices and generic skills such as collaboration and communication. Most importantly, it was the first local science curriculum that embraced understanding of nature of science (NOS), for example, being \u201Cable to appreciate and understand the evolutionary nature of scientific knowledge\u201D (CDC, 1998, p. 3) was stated as one of its broad curriculum aims. In the first topic, \u201CWhat is science?\u201D, teachers are expected to discuss with students some features about science, for example, its scope and limitations, some typical features about scientific investigations, for example, fair testing, control of variables, predictions, hypothesis, inferences, and conclusions. Such an emphasis on NOS was further supported in the revised secondary 4 and 5 (grade 10 and 11) physics, chemistry, and biology curricula (CDC, 2002). Scientific investigation continued to be an important component while the scope of NOS was slightly extended to include recognition of the usefulness and limitations of science as well as the interactions between science, technology, and society (STS).","publish_time":"2011-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Siu Ling; Wan, Zhihong; Cheng, Maurice Man Wai","journal":"Socio-scientific Issues in the Classroom","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/025a1ac57e8e1df68b153af3b462dcc05651ffa3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121923.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121923/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Curriculum Development Council"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["science education","limitations of science","local science curriculum","scientific investigations","revised junior secondary science curriculum","example","new curriculum","broad curriculum","CDC","evolutionary nature of scientific knowledge","Curriculum Development Council","scope of NOS","desired means of learning scientific knowledge","Hong Kong","teachers","understanding of nature","typical features","development of inquiry practices","control of variables","generic skills","fair testing","grades","international trends","hypothesis","predictions","implementation","considerable changes","important component","physics","inferences","collaboration","decade","chemistry","biology curricula","technology","line","series of reforms","classes","communication","turn","recognition","society","usefulness","students","interactions","STS","conclusions","century","emphasis","topic"],"language":"en"},

Each of them can act by itself or in combination with the other two in developing a systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome (SIRS) that is a generalized reaction to the morbid event. The time course of SIRS is variable and influenced by the number and severity of subsequent insults (e.g., reparative surgery, acquired hospital infections). It occurs simultaneously with a complex of counter-regulatory mechanisms (compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome, CARS) that limit the aggressive effects of SIRS. In adjunct, a progressive dysfunction of the acquired (lymphocytes) immune system develops with increased risk for immunoparalysis and associated infectious complications. Both humoral and cellular effectors participate to the development of SIRS and CARS. The most important humoral mediators are pro-inflammatory (IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) cytokines and chemokines, complement, leukotrienes, and PAF. Effector cells include neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. The endothelium is a key factor for production of remote organ damage as it exerts potent chemo-attracting effects on inflammatory cells, allows for leukocyte trafficking into tissues and organs, and promotes further inflammation by cytokines release. Moreover, the loss of vasoregulatory properties and the increased permeability contribute to the development of hypotension and tissue edema. Finally, the disseminated activation of the coagulation cascade causes the widespread deposition of microthrombi with resulting maldistribution of capillary blood flow and ultimately hypoxic cellular damage. This mechanism together with increased vascular permeability and vasodilation is responsible for the development of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).","publish_time":"2018-06-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arlati, Sergio","journal":"Operative Techniques and Recent Advances in Acute Care and Emergency Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae7876319874b494f69b47c350f68e4bf27a6a45.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122041.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122041/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIRS","PAF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of SIRS","inflammatory cells","increased permeability","aggressive effects of SIRS","systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome","increased risk","increased vascular permeability","multiple organ dysfunction syndrome","lymphocytes","development of hypotension","cellular effectors","CARS","Effector cells","endothelial cells","time course of SIRS","compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome","hypoxic cellular damage","production of remote organ damage","main effectors","generalized reaction","progressive dysfunction","cytokines release","ischemia-reperfusion injury","important humoral mediators","resulting maldistribution of capillary blood flow","regulatory mechanisms","widespread deposition of microthrombi","trauma","macrophages","potent chemo","coagulation cascade","key factor","reparative surgery","immunoparalysis","neutrophils","monocytes","leukocyte trafficking","vasodilation","immune system","severity of subsequent insults","number","organs","complex of counter","pathophysiology of acute illness","MODS","loss of vasoregulatory properties","infectious complications","hospital infections","disseminated activation","tissues","endothelium","leukotrienes","inflammation","morbid event","tissue edema","chemokines","adjunct","PAF","combination"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we discuss our experience in generating mouse models of cuff-induced injury of the femoral artery and attempt to provide a better understanding of cuff-induced neointimal formation.","publish_time":"2015-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kubota, Tetsuya; Kubota, Naoto","journal":"Mouse Models of Vascular Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a8f3186b70906c2d320f1ed7884af5bf054b229.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122099.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122099/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouse models of cuff","investigation of atherosclerosis","progression of atherosclerosis","easy evaluation of atherosclerosis","relevant mouse models of cardiovascular disease","induced neointimal formation","neointimal thickening","treatment of coronary heart disease","better understanding of cuff","mechanism of neointimal hyperplasia","LDLR-KO mice","induced injury","simpler tools","effective tools","precise understanding","ApoE-KO","development of new technologies","Ischemic heart failure","progressive atherosclerotic lesion","long time","breeding strategies","femoral artery","experience","major cause of death","increase","remarkable technological advances","space","costs","research","review"],"language":"en"},

Proteases can promote inflammation by regulating expression and activity of different pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other immune components in the lung compartment. They are categorized in three major subcategories: serine proteases, metalloproteases and cysteine proteases especially in case of lung diseases. Neutrophil-derived serine proteases (NSPs), metalloproteases and some mast cell-derived proteases are mainly focused here. Their modes of actions are different in different diseases for e.g. NE induces the release of IL-8 from lung epithelial cells through a MyD88/IRAK/TRAF-6-dependent pathway and also through EGFR MAPK pathway. NSPs contribute to immune regulation during inflammation through the cleavage and activation of specific cellular receptors. MMPs can also influence the progression of various inflammatory processes and there are many non-matrix substrates for MMPs, such as chemokines, growth factors and receptors. During lung inflammation interplay between NE and MMP is an important significant phenomenon. They have been evaluated as therapeutic targets in several inflammatory lung diseases. Here we review the role of proteases in various lung inflammatory diseases with emphasis on their mode of action and contribution to immune regulation during inflammation.","publish_time":"2013-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chakraborty, Kaustav; Bhattacharyya, Arindam","journal":"Proteases in Health and Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5a07bea28f8cadbe2615c9130f625ad09d9161e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122125.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122125/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFR MAPK","MMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inflammatory lung diseases","various lung inflammatory diseases","cysteine proteases","role of proteases","case of lung diseases","lung inflammation interplay","different diseases","lung compartment","Neutrophil-derived serine proteases","mast cell-derived proteases","lung epithelial cells","immune regulation","metalloproteases","activity of different pro-inflammatory cytokines","chemokines","progression of various inflammatory processes","immune components","NSPs","MMPs","dependent pathway","EGFR MAPK pathway","activation of specific cellular receptors","cleavage","emphasis","expression","mode of action","IRAK","MyD88","contribution","release of IL","non-matrix substrates","TRAF","capacity","major subcategories","therapeutic targets","important significant phenomenon","growth factors","modes of actions","peptide bonds","proteins","enzymes"],"language":"en"},

It is hence argued that, in the case of the north-east Chinese-Russian frontier, this interpretive strategy condemned Mongol and Buryat societies to a static condition of functional unreason.

Together with the angiopoietin growth factors (ANGPT1, ANGPT2, ANGPT4, also abbreviated as ANG), the TIE receptors form an endothelial specific signaling pathway with important functions in the regulation of lymphatic and cardiovascular development and vascular homeostasis. Angiopoietins exist in multimeric forms that activate the TIE receptors via unique mechanism. In endothelial cell\u2013cell contacts, angiopoietins induce the formation of homomeric in trans TIE receptor complexes extending across the cell junctions, whereas matrix-bound angiopoietin-1 (ANG1) activates the TIE receptors in a cis configuration. In comparison to the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, the TIE receptors undergo little ubiquitin-mediated degradation after activation, whereas TIE2 signaling is negatively regulated by the vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase, VE-PTP. ANG1 activation of TIE2 supports vascular stabilization, whereas angiopoietin-2 (ANG2), a context-dependent weak TIE2 agonist/antagonist, promotes pathological tumor angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and inflammation. Recently, ANG2 has been found to mediate some of its vascular destabilizing and angiogenic functions via integrin signalling. The circulating levels of ANG2 are increased in cancer, and in several human diseases associated with inflammation and vascular leak, for example, in sepsis. Blocking of ANG2 has emerged as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for these diseases. In addition, preclinical results demonstrate that genetic TIE1 deletion in mice inhibits the vascularization and growth of tumor isografts and protects from atherosclerosis, with little effect on normal vascular homeostasis in adult mice. The ability of the ANG-TIE pathway to control vessel stability and angiogenesis makes it an interesting vascular target for the treatment of the various diseases.","publish_time":"2015-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saharinen, Pipsa; Jeltsch, Michael; Santoyo, Mayte M.; Lepp\u00E4nen, Veli-Matti; Alitalo, Kari","journal":"Receptor Tyrosine Kinases: Family and Subfamilies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55c14de5f4e166e57de793d6f1976c0c29c932eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123982.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ANG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TIE receptors","vascular destabilizing","vascular leak","vascular permeability","vascular stabilization","vascular endothelial growth factor receptors","endothelial cell","normal vascular homeostasis","interesting vascular target","vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase","endothelial TIE1","ANG-TIE pathway","ANG1 activation of TIE2","trans TIE receptor complexes","angiopoietin growth factors","TIE2 receptor tyrosine kinases","cell junctions","cell contacts","growth of tumor isografts","Angiopoietins","inflammation","human diseases","various diseases","circulating levels of ANG2","pathological tumor angiogenesis","matrix-bound angiopoietin","context-dependent weak TIE2 agonist","little effect","important functions","angiogenic functions","adult mice","unique mechanism","genetic TIE1 deletion","unique extracellular domains","little ubiquitin-mediated degradation","antagonist","distinct subfamily","regulation of lymphatic","formation of homomeric","vascularization","preclinical results","atherosclerosis","ANGPT1","ANGPT2","VE-PTP","cardiovascular development","treatment","vessel stability","integrin signalling","potential novel therapeutic strategy","ANGPT4","cancer","example","multimeric forms","comparison","addition","cis configuration","sepsis"],"language":"en"},

The enzymatic mechanism for a single turnover is reasonably well understood based on biochemical and structural studies that are consistent with divalent metal ion dependent nonspecific nicking of a phosphodiester bond in one of the strands of double stranded DNA. Recombinant human DNase I (rhDNase I, rhDNase, Pulmozyme(\u00AE), dornase alfa) has been expressed in mammalian cell culture in Chinese hamster ovary cells and developed clinically where it is aerosolized into the airways for treatment of pulmonary disease in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). rhDNase I hydrolyzes the DNA in purulent sputum of CF patients and reduces sputum viscoelasticity. Reduction of high molecular weight DNA into smaller fragments by treatment with aerosolized rhDNase I has been proposed as the mechanism to reduce the mucus viscosity and improve mucus clearability from obstructed airways in patients. The improved clearance of the purulent mucus enhances pulmonary function and reduces recurrent exacerbations of respiratory symptoms. rhDNase I was approved for clinical use in 1993 and has been widely used as a safe and effective therapy for CF patients. The use of rhDNase I has also been investigated in other diseases where exogenous DNA has been implicated in the disease pathology.","publish_time":"2019-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lazarus, Robert A.; Wagener\u2020, Jeffrey S.","journal":"Pharmaceutical Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e02a78677b050939d2a4867fc3b4c387a7c13155.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124075.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124075/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aerosolized rhDNase","use of rhDNase","exogenous DNA","purulent sputum of CF patients","purulent mucus","hydrolysis of extracellular DNA","mucus clearability","mucus viscosity","treatment of pulmonary disease","strands of double stranded DNA","Reduction of high molecular weight DNA","Recombinant human DNase","pulmonary function","obstructed airways","sputum viscoelasticity","disease pathology","enzymatic mechanism","Human deoxyribonuclease","clinical use","smaller fragments","divalent metal ion dependent nonspecific nicking","mammalian cell culture","Chinese hamster ovary cells","phosphodiester bond","cystic fibrosis","structural studies","recurrent exacerbations of respiratory symptoms","effective therapy","Pulmozyme","improved clearance","numerous types of nucleases","nature","single turnover","endonuclease","dornase alfa","diseases"],"language":"en"},

These receptors trigger inflammatory responses, activate innate immune responses, and prime adaptive immune responses to eradicate invading microbes [1]. TLR are members of a family of pattern-recognition receptors, which recognize molecular structures of bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa (pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs), as well as endogenous structures and proteins released during inflammation (damage/danger-associated molecular patterns or DAMPs). To date, ten different TLR have been identified in humans and twelve in mice. TLR are expressed on all cells of the immune system, but also on parenchymal cells of many organs and tissues. The binding of a PAMP to a TLR results in cellular activation and initiates a variety of effector functions, including cytokine secretion, proliferation, co-stimulation or phagocyte maturation. To facilitate microbial recognition and to amplify cellular responses, certain TLR require additional proteins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP), CD14, CD36 and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1). In this chapter, the role of CD14 as an accessory receptor for TLR in lung inflammation and infection is discussed.

In this graph, vertices identify individuals and edges establish the existence of some type of relations between them. In real communities, the possible edges may be active or not for variable periods of time. These so-called temporal networks typically result from an endogenous social dynamics, usually coupled to the process under study taking place in the community. For instance, disease spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to reconsider maintaining or not their social contacts. Here we investigate the impact of such a dynamical network structure on disease dynamics, where infection occurs along the edges of the network. To this end, we define an endogenous network dynamics coupled with disease spreading. We show that the effective infectiousness of a disease taking place along the edges of this temporal network depends on the population size, the number of infected individuals in the population and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected, ultimately dictated by availability of information regarding each individual\u2019s health status.

In this work, we propose an information-driven adaptive model, where disease and disease information can evolve simultaneously. For the information-driven adaptive process, susceptible (infected) individuals who have abilities to recognize the disease would break the links of their infected (susceptible) neighbors to prevent the epidemic from further spreading. Simulation results and numerical analyses based on the pairwise approach indicate that the information-driven adaptive process can not only slow down the speed of epidemic spreading, but can also diminish the epidemic prevalence at the final state significantly. In addition, the disease spreading and information diffusion pattern on the lattice as well as on a real-world network give visual representations about how the disease is trapped into an isolated field with the information-driven adaptive process. Furthermore, we perform the local bifurcation analysis on four types of dynamical regions, including healthy, a continuous dynamic behavior, bistable and endemic, to understand the evolution of the observed dynamical behaviors. This work may shed some lights on understanding how information affects human activities on responding to epidemic spreading.","publish_time":"2018-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhan, Xiu-Xiu; Liu, Chuang; Sun, Gui-Quan; Zhang, Zi-Ke","journal":"Chaos Solitons Fractals","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126912.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126912/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsxMjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease information","adaptive process","information diffusion pattern","speed of epidemic spreading","adaptive model","epidemic prevalence","real-world network","dynamics","types of dynamical regions","observed dynamical behaviors","continuous dynamic behavior","human activities","local bifurcation analysis","evolution","lattice","individuals","visual representations","isolated field","Simulation results","numerical analyses","attention","final state","interplay","abilities","lights","neighbors","links","recent years","Research","addition"],"language":"en"},

In case of polarized epithelial cells, the apical plasma membrane is frequently the boundary between an organism and its environment. The plasmalemma possesses the elements that endow a cell with the capacity to converse with its environment. Plasmalemmal receptor and transducer proteins allow the cell to recognize and respond to various external influences. Membrane-associated proteins anchor cells to their substrata and mediate their integration into tissues. Many properties of a given cell type may be attributed to the protein composition of its plasma membrane. Most cells go to large lengths to control the nature and distribution of polypeptides that populate their plasmalemmas. Cells regulate the expression of genes encoding plasma membrane proteins. Proteins destined for the insertion into the plasma membrane pass through a complex system of processing organelles prior to arriving at their site of ultimate functional residence. Each of these organelles makes a unique contribution to the maturation of these proteins as they transit through them. This chapter discusses the postsynthetic steps involved in the biogenesis of plasma membrane proteins. The chapter discusses some of the events common to all plasmalemmal polypeptides, with special emphasis on those that contribute directly to the character of the cell surface. The chapter then discusses the specializations, associated with cell types, possessing differentiated cell surface sub-domains. The chapter highlights some of the important and fascinating questions confronting investigators interested in the cell biology of the plasma membrane.","publish_time":"2008-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caplan, Michael J.","journal":"Curr Top Membr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128438/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell surface membrane","biogenesis of plasma membrane proteins","plasma membrane pass","apical plasma membrane","cell types","cell biology","Membrane-associated proteins anchor cells","given cell type","transducer proteins","differentiated cell surface sub-domains","environment","chapter highlights","boundary","plasmalemmal polypeptides","case of polarized epithelial cells","distribution of polypeptides","Plasmalemmal receptor","complex system of processing organelles","substrata","investigators","expression of genes","nature","fascinating questions","events common","insertion","site of ultimate functional residence","large lengths","unique contribution","postsynthetic steps","protein composition","special emphasis","maturation","properties","specializations","various external influences","integration","tissues","plasmalemmas","organism","elements","capacity","character"],"language":"en"},

Within the past decade, there are many new emerging infectious diseases. An important concern is on the pandemic of those new emerging infections. The cross species infection from animal to human, zoonosis, is usually problematic and hard to manage. The well-known situations are on new emerging atypical influenza infections. In this brief article, the author discuss on three important cross species emerging influenza, H5N1 bird flu, H1N1 swine flu and H7N9 bird flu. The basic details of those new influenzas genetic aberration and the concept for surveillance and prediction of new mutation that result in the new cross species emerging zoonosis are also mentioned in this article.","publish_time":"2014-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wiwanitkit, Viroj","journal":"Asian Pac J Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128874/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjsyOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new emerging infections","new cross species emerging zoonosis","new emerging infectious diseases","important cross species emerging influenza","new emerging atypical influenza infections","cross species infection","prediction of new mutation","important concern","new influenzas genetic aberration","H5N1 bird flu","H7N9 bird flu","H1N1 swine flu","important public health concern","brief article","concept","surveillance","human","animal","author","pandemic","basic details","well-known situations","past decade"],"language":"en"},

Both of these factors contribute to heat stress, which influences cow behavior. The physiological response of cows to heat stress is one component of a system-wide gene network. Within this environment, a superior cow\u0027s ability to get pregnant early during postpartum is favorable as to reduce the trait days open and to increase productive life. Recently, many reproductive specialists have recommended using pregnancy rate as a measure of reproductive success, after converting this trait into a quantitative value using a linear formula. In comparison to the traditional measure of days open, pregnancy rate calculation includes more easily cows that do not become pregnant; furthermore, the output variable indicates that larger values are more desirable, and therefore, more understandable by dairy producers. The objective herein was to predict pregnancy rate in lactating Holstein cows using molecular markers associated with fertility in Holstein cows under a heat-stressed environment. This study included 500 cows from three dairy herds located in the Yaqui Valley of Sonora. A blood sample was collected from every cow and spotted onto FTA cards. The DNA was extracted from each card and used to genotype 179 tag SNP within 43 genes in the prolactin and GH-IGF1 pathways. Five SNP within the genes IGFBP7, IGFBP2, PAPPA1, SSTR2, and STAT6 were associated with pregnancy rate using a mixed effects model. The genotype term was later included in this model to calculate allele substitution effects. Molecular breeding values of the individual cows were calculated by summing the additive genotype effect for each SNP that showed a significant independent association with pregnancy rate, and the average MBV was 0.46 \u00B1 0.01%. Two statistical regression models were used to predict the variable pregnancy rate: a full model that included effects of days and number of lactations, contemporary group (e.g., farm management group), health status, and MBV and a reduced model that only included MBV. Coefficients of determination were 37.61% and 3.07% for full and reduced models, respectively (P \u003C 0.01). These results indicate that five SNP explained only a small proportion of the additive genetic variance for pregnancy rate. Additional research is needed to understand if these results are due to low heritability/repeatability of a fertility and (or) if these results are also influenced by heat stress.","publish_time":"2017-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zamorano-Algandar, R.; Leyva-Corona, J.

Tissue inflammation is partly orchestrated by macrophage responses to bacterial infection. Studies in monogastric species showed classical phenotype macrophages have proinflammatory responses and alternative phenotype macrophages have protective and restorative responses during disease. However, responses of diverse bovine macrophage phenotypes to lipopolysaccharide are unclear. The objective of this research was to compare the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in several phenotypes of bovine primary monocyte-derived macrophages. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood using Ficoll (n = 8 cows). Monocytes were identified using mouse anti-bovine CD172\u03B1 monoclonal antibody and separated from lymphocytes using magnetic assisted cell sorting. Monocytes were cultured with interferon-\u03B3 or interleukins (IL) 4 and 13 to induce a classical or alternative macrophage phenotype, respectively, then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Macrophage mRNA was quantified in adipose using qPCR. Fold changes in mRNA concentration were calculated by 2(-\u0394\u0394Ct), using the untreated cells as calibrator and three endogenous control mRNA. Treatment differences in mRNA expression were identified using Fisher pairwise comparisons and ANOVA (P \u2264 0.05). Flow cytometry showed magnetic assisted cell sorting increased CD172\u03B1(\u002B) cells from 22.3 \u00B1 1.9 to 81.6 \u00B1 2.8%. After 48 h in vitro, CD68 expression increased and CD172\u03B1(\u002B) was 95.2 \u00B1 0.4%. Lipopolysaccharide increased IL6, IL10, TNF, and CCL2 expression. Lipopolysaccharide stimulated IL6 and IL10 expression was decreased in alternative macrophages, whereas lipopolysaccharide stimulated TNF expression was increased in classical macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide stimulated CCL2 expression was not different between macrophage types. Together these results show an exacerbated proinflammatory cytokine profile in a model of classical bovine macrophages during gram negative bacterial disease. Results suggest that macrophage phenotype could be involved with severe inflammatory responses seen during dairy cow periparturient periods characterized by prolonged and exacerbated lipolysis and increased disease susceptibility. Ongoing research will describe macrophage phenotype during bovine disease and identify factors contributing to phenotype change. Such factors could ultimately be manipulated to control the bovine macrophage inflammatory response.","publish_time":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raphael, W.; Contreras, G.

Investigations of recent outbreaks confirmed that contaminated feed plays a role in virus transmission. This risk makes it necessary to evaluate the survival of such viruses in various feed ingredients. The objective of our experiment was to characterize the inactivation of PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV in various feed and ingredient matrices. To determine differences in virus survival, 5-g samples of complete feed, spray-dried porcine plasma, meat meal, meat and bone meal, blood meal, corn, soybean meal, and low, medium, and high oil dried distillers grains with solubles were weighed into separate scintillation vials. These samples were inoculated with 1 mL of PEDV, PDCoV, or TGEV and incubated at room temperature for up to 56 d. At each time point, surviving virus was eluted and the supernatant was inoculated into vero-81 cells for PEDV, or swine testicular cells for PDCoV and TGEV. Cells were observed daily for 10 d for cytopathic effects, and this information was used to calculate a median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) using the Karber method. Inactivation kinetics were determined using the Weibull model. A delta value was estimated from the model, indicating the time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. This delta value was then compared across ingredients using the mixed procedure of SAS, and correlations between ingredient proximate analysis data and delta values were determined. Results showed that soybean meal had the greatest delta value (7.50 d) for PEDV compared with other ingredients (P \u003C 0.06). Likewise, PDCoV (42.04 d) and TGEV (42.00 d) delta values were highest in soybean meal (P \u003C 0.001). There was a moderate positive correlation between moisture and the delta value for PDCoV (r = 0.49, P = 0.01) and TGEV (r = 0.41, P = 0.02). There was also a moderate negative correlation between lipid content and the delta value for TGEV (r = \u22120.51, P = 0.01), suggesting that TGEV is less stable in ingredients with greater lipid content compared with ingredients with less lipid content. In conclusion, these results indicate that the first log reduction of PDCoV and TGEV takes the greatest amount of time in soybean meal and it appears to be the result of greater moisture content.","publish_time":"2016-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trudeau, M.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank are two dominant actors in health and development. Each espouses a different ideal of health as it relates to the process of development. The WHO defines health as a human right, and focuses on health outcomes as inputs to and the result of development. The World Bank\u2019s approach to development focuses largely on macro-economic growth as input to human capabilities. The World Bank became a leading actor in international health policy in the 1990s when it operationalized health as an outcome of financial and health care systems. This chapter looks at programming efforts by the WHO and the World Bank to foster development via investment in health or through macro-economic adjustment. Results are mixed. Efforts to improve primary care were successful in improving health outcomes of children under five, but made little impact on maternal mortality. Structural adjustment programs achieved moderate success with medium- to long-term economic growth but increased health inequities. These mixed achievements resulted in an effort by the United Nations to foster a multi-sectoral approach to development espoused in the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals.","publish_time":"2017-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Sandy A.","journal":"Challenges in Health and Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b58e92fdfea3989199fb6656d5444a5d62b1c48.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114987.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114987/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","World Bank","United Nations"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["operationalized health","World Health Organization","health care systems","result of development","health outcomes of children","process of development","international health policy","increased health inequities","different ideal of health","Millennium Development Goals","Sustainable Development Goals","World Bank\u2019s approach","macro-economic growth","macro-economic adjustment","long-term economic growth","primary care","human capabilities","human right","programming efforts","mixed achievements","multi-sectoral approach","Structural adjustment programs","moderate success","leading actor","outcome of financial","investment","dominant actors","United Nations","inputs","little impact","Multilateral agencies","maternal mortality","variety of ways","chapter","Results"],"language":"en"},

Chemotherapeutic agents, whether administered for treatment of an underlying hematologic malignancy, for induction prior to transplant, or for the treatment of GVHD or graft rejection after transplant, may cause lung injury that in some cases may not become apparent until years later. Radiation-induced lung injury may cause a distinct pattern of lung injury, which may present months after exposure. In hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients, pulmonary diagnoses such as engraftment syndrome, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage can mimic pneumonia. After lung transplantation, infiltrates may be seen as a consequence of primary graft dysfunction or allograft rejection. Organizing pneumonia may be seen both in recipients of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants. Organizing pneumonia may be cryptogenic or associated with the use of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus. Failure to accurately diagnose non-infectious infiltrates may lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment and failure to address the underlying pathophysiologic process.","publish_time":"2018-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kotloff, Robert M.; Dickey, Burton F.; Vander Els, Nicholas","journal":"Principles and Practice of Transplant Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9781aa72b1bb09b2ebb1c0243c57222c7e6655d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119916.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119916/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung transplantation","distinct pattern of lung injury","transfusion-related lung injury","Radiation-induced lung injury","differential diagnosis of lung infiltrates","idiopathic pneumonia syndrome","non-infectious infiltrates","hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients","treatment of GVHD","Failure","hematopoietic stem cell transplants","unnecessary antibiotic treatment","underlying pathophysiologic process","pulmonary diagnoses","engraftment syndrome","non-infectious processes","allograft rejection","underlying hematologic malignancy","non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema","consequence of primary graft dysfunction","recipients of solid organ","diffuse alveolar hemorrhage","induction","bilateral airspace opacification","cases","mTOR inhibitor sirolimus","months","years","Chemotherapeutic agents","exposure"],"language":"en"},

There are, however, many controversies regarding indications for initiating ECMO in this setting and the appropriate management strategies thereafter. Broad indications for ECMO include hypoxia, hypercarbia, and severe air leak syndrome, with hypoxia being the most common. There are many disease-specific considerations when evaluating children for ECMO, but there are currently very few, if any, absolute contraindications. Venovenous rather than veno-arterial ECMO cannulation is the preferred configuration for ECMO support of acute respiratory failure due to its superior side-effect profile. The approach to lung management on ECMO is variable and should be individualized to the patient, with the main goal of reducing the risk of VILI. ECMO is a relatively rare intervention, and there are likely a minimum number of cases per year at a given center to maintain competency. Patients who have prolonged ECMO runs (i.e., greater than 21 days) are less likely to survive, though no absolute duration of ECMO that would mandate withdrawal of ECMO support can be currently recommended.","publish_time":"2018-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Friedman, Matthew; Hobson, Michael","journal":"Pediatric Critical Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c51aa12574aa13df933ebdd006823d251757aada.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119989.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119989/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO","VILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["initiating ECMO","prolonged ECMO","withdrawal of ECMO support","absolute duration of ECMO","ECMO support of acute respiratory failure","veno-arterial ECMO cannulation","children","hypoxia","lung management","Broad indications","absolute contraindications","appropriate management strategies","preferred configuration","hypercarbia","setting","severe air leak syndrome","year","minimum number of cases","use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","given center","past","superior side-effect profile","disease-specific considerations","main goal","major advancements","decades","Venovenous","rare intervention","approach","controversies","risk of VILI","competency","days","care","Patients"],"language":"en"},

In transplant recipients, this group can include viruses with no recognized pathogenicity in immunocompetent patients and those that result in atypical or more severe disease presentations in the immunocompromised host. In this chapter, we begin by discussing viral diagnostics and techniques used for viral discovery, specifically as they apply to emerging and rare infections in this patient population. Focus then shifts to specific emerging and re-emerging viruses in the transplant population, including human T-cell leukemia virus 1, rabies, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, human bocavirus, parvovirus 4, measles, mumps, orf, and dengue. We have also included a brief discussion on emerging viruses and virus families with few or no reported cases in transplant recipients: monkeypox, nipah and hendra, chikungunya and other alphaviruses, hantavirus and the Bunyaviridae, and filoviruses. Finally, concerns regarding infectious disease complications in xenotransplantation and the reporting of rare viral infections are addressed. With the marked increase in the number of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants performed worldwide, we expect a corresponding rise in the reports of emerging viral infections in transplant hosts, both from known viruses and those yet to be identified.","publish_time":"2018-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Susanna K.; Waggoner, Jesse J.; Deresinski, Stan","journal":"Principles and Practice of Transplant Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28afef5f112cad7de0deafcb801fbb2dc1645ccf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119999.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119999/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identified viruses","reports of emerging viral infections","re-emerging viruses","known viruses","Viral infections account","transplant recipients","transplant population","viral diagnostics","reporting of rare viral infections","viral discovery","rare infections","transplant hosts","virus families","large proportion of emerging infectious diseases","infectious disease complications","disease incidence","group","human T-cell leukemia virus","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","severe disease presentations","human bocavirus","apparent increase","patient population","marked increase","hematopoietic stem cell transplants","number of solid organ","monkeypox","rabies","xenotransplantation","parvovirus","reported cases","chikungunya","measles","hendra","nipah","recognized pathogenicity","brief discussion","hantavirus","mumps","alphaviruses","immunocompetent patients","immunocompromised host","concerns","agents","techniques","corresponding rise","Bunyaviridae","orf","filoviruses","dengue"],"language":"en"},

As HIV-infected patients are living longer, noninfectious pulmonary diseases are becoming increasingly prevalent with a proportional decline in the incidence of opportunistic infections (OIs). Pulmonary OIs such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and tuberculosis are still responsible for a significant proportion of pulmonary diseases in HIV-infected patients. However, bacterial pneumonia (BP) and noninfectious pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and interstitial lung disease (ILD) account for a growing number of pulmonary diseases in aging HIV-infected patients. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the spectrum and management of pulmonary diseases in aging HIV-infected patients, although limited data exists to guide management of many noninfectious pulmonary diseases in HIV-infected patients. In the absence of such data, treatment of lung diseases in HIV-infected patients should generally follow guidelines for management established in HIV-uninfected patients.","publish_time":"2011-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Akg\u00FCn, Kathleen M.; Crothers, Kristina","journal":"Aging and Lung Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91bc8b948907c3205e51648242980ca79ce49ec6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120014.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120014/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aging HIV-infected patients","noninfectious pulmonary diseases","management of pulmonary diseases","HIV-uninfected patients","Pulmonary OIs","aging HIV-infected population","growing number of pulmonary diseases","significant proportion of pulmonary diseases","treatment of lung diseases","Successful treatment of HIV","pulmonary arterial hypertension","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","lung cancer","interstitial lung disease","bacterial pneumonia","limited data","Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia","PAH","account","COPD","ILD","combination antiretroviral therapy","PCP","tuberculosis","BP","incidence of opportunistic infections","proportional decline","spectrum","guidelines","chapter","absence","purpose"],"language":"en"},

As a rule, intensive care is based on mechanical ventilation often requiring high doses of sedatives and narcotics. Despite major progress in intensive care medicine the rate of mortality is still very high. Whereas in the past the level of medical progress has been rated based on the mortality rate alone, the many negative somatic and psychological sequelae in long-term-survivors of ARDS are only now being appreciated. From a perspective of C/L psychiatry persisting cognitive dysfunctions, anxiety and mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) in their negative impact on health-related quality of life are intensively investigated. In the etiopathogenesis of PTSD associated with ALI/ARDS, many influences have to be discussed, e.g., increases in CO(2) triggering panic affects, a mismatch of norepinephric overstimulation and cortisol insufficiency, negative effects of high doses of benzodiazepines resulting in oversedation, prolonged phases of weaning and more frequent states of delirium.

HCoV-OC43 is a member of Betacoronavirus genus that includes also the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shown to express proteins with the potential to evade early innate immune responses. However, the ability of HCoV-OC43 to antagonise the intracellular antiviral defences has not yet been investigated. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of HCoV-OC43 structural (membrane and nucleocapsid) and accessory (ns5a and ns2a) proteins in the modulation of antiviral gene expression profile in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells using PCR array analysis. METHODS: HCoV-OC43 membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), ns5a and ns2a mRNA were amplified and cloned into the pAcGFP1-N expression vector (Clontech), followed by transfection in HEK-293 cells. Expression of M, N, ns5a and ns2a proteins were confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence test. Three days post-transfection, the cells were challenged by Sendai virus. The Human Antiviral Response PCR array system (Qiagen) was used to profile the antiviral gene expression in HEK-293 cells, using the fold regulation comparison and the manual normalisation methods. RESULTS: Around 50\u201360 genes were downregulated by HCoV-OC43 proteins, the most prominent genes being those critical for the activation of transcription factors involved in the antiviral response like interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Among the most important downregulated genes were those coding for Interferons (IFNs) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), pro-apoptotic and pyroptotic proteins (Caspases, cathepsins, tumour necrosis factor), pro-inflammatory cytokines (Interleukins), pattern recognition receptors (PRRs; toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors) and their signaling transduction proteins (TICAM1, MAVS). CONCLUSION: This study shows for the first time that similarly to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 has the ability to downregulate the transcription of genes critical for the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways.

The purpose of this study was to determine the bioburden on OR surfaces to guide future quality improvement efforts and optimize OR cleanliness. METHODS: This study was performed in the pediatric ORs of a 200-bed, academically affiliated, children\u2019s hospital with ~6000 general and subspecialty surgical procedures annually. Immediately after cases were finished, but prior to cleaning, the 3M Clean-Trace Clinical Hygiene Monitoring System was used to quantify bioburden (in surface ATP concentration) on 24 surfaces in each of 8 ORs. These 24 surfaces were previously identified by the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses as high-touch surfaces and various disciplines are responsible for their cleaning. Each OR was sampled 1\u20134 times. A surface passed the test of cleanliness if the result was \u003C250 relative light units (RLUs). RESULTS: In all, 364 surfaces were tested. The median RLUs were \u003C250, 250\u2013850, and \u003E850 RLUs for 7, 11, and 6 surfaces, respectively. Of the 24 surfaces tested, all demonstrated bioburden \u2265250 at least once. Median RLUs for each surface ranged from 39-2282 and median RLUs for each OR ranged from 196 to 1534. The highest bioburden occurred following cardiac surgery (median 1534, range 24-13275 RLU) and the lowest bioburden occurred after neurosurgery (median 196, range 23-2475 RLU). The surfaces with the highest bioburden were the anesthesia keyboards (median 2282, range 347-38376 RLU) and core door handles (median 1471, range 140\u20136788 RLU) and those with the lowest bioburden were the Mayo stand (median 39, range 19-765 RLU) and back table (median 39, range 17-406 RLU). CONCLUSION: ATP testing demonstrated that most OR surfaces were contaminated with organic material. While OR surfaces prior to cleaning are expected to be contaminated, these data highlight the importance of cleaning/disinfection. These findings are being used to develop educational tools and interventions for the interdisciplinary OR team, which will focus on delineation of cleaning responsibilities, the use of appropriate cleaning products, and audits of end-of-case cleaning and terminal cleaning.

The PK of ERV in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) or hepatic impairment (HI) were investigated. METHODS: Two multi-center studies were completed; one in subjects with ESRD and one in subjects with mild, moderate or severe HI based upon Child-Pugh scoring. Each included a cohort of healthy subjects (HS) matched by gender, age and BMI. A single IV dose of 1.5 mg/kg ERV was administered. PK parameters were calculated using standard non-compartmental methods and within study comparisons of PK for the ESRD and HI subjects were made with HS. RESULTS: The following comparative AUC(inf) and C(max) values for ERV were observed: CONCLUSION: Following a single IV dose of ERV, the systemic exposures in subjects with ESRD and mild or moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those observed in HS. The 2-fold increase in AUC(inf) observed in subjects with severe HI did not result in increased adverse events.

Assembly quality and completeness of bat genomes vary a lot and especially non-coding RNA (ncRNA) annotations are incomplete or simply missing. Accordingly, standard bioinformatics pipelines for gene expression analysis often ignore ncRNAs such as microRNAs or long antisense RNAs. The main cause of this problem is the use of incomplete genome annotations. We present a complete screening for ncRNAs within 16 bat genomes. NcRNAs affect a remarkable variety of vital biological functions, including gene expression regulation, RNA processing, RNA interference and, as recently described, regulatory processes in viral infections. Within all investigated bat assemblies, we annotated 667 ncRNA families including 162 snoRNAs and 193 miRNAs as well as rRNAs, tRNAs, several snRNAs and lncRNAs, and other structural ncRNA elements. We validated our ncRNA candidates by six RNA-Seq data sets and show significant expression patterns that have never been described before in a bat species on such a large scale. Our annotations will be usable as a resource (rna.uni-jena.de/supplements/bats) for deeper studying of bat evolution, ncRNAs repertoire, gene expression and regulation, ecology and important host\u2013virus interactions.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mostajo, Nelly F; Lataretu, Marie; Krautwurst, Sebastian; Mock, Florian; Desir\u00F2, Daniel; Lamkiewicz, Kevin; Collatz, Maximilian; Schoen, Andreas; Weber, Friedemann; Marz, Manja; H\u00F6lzer, Martin","journal":"NAR Genom Bioinform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b8c67ac3dbc51ec4287e9a76541767146106129.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108008.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108008/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Assembly"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene expression regulation","bat species","gene expression analysis","completeness of bat genomes","RNA processing","ncRNAs repertoire","RNA interference","ncRNA families","ncRNA candidates","investigated bat assemblies","significant expression patterns","non-coding RNA","deeper studying of bat evolution","structural ncRNA elements","bats","RNA-Seq data sets","use of incomplete genome annotations","ecology","remarkable variety of vital biological functions","lot","important host","unique properties","problem","lncRNAs","standard bioinformatics pipelines","miRNAs","tRNAs","snRNAs","virus interactions","supplements","microRNAs","resource","Assembly quality","focus of scientific studies","exceptional animals","complete screening","regulatory processes","viral infections","rRNAs","snoRNAs","large scale","main cause","antisense RNAs","studied mammals"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, the understanding of viral strategies to manipulate cell function disrupting plant defenses and enhancing viral infection cycles is fundamental to the production of virus-resistant plant lines. After invading susceptible plants, viruses create conditions that favor local and systemic infections by suppressing multiple layers of innate host defenses while use cellular machinery to own benefit. Viral interference in interlinked essential cellular functions results in phenotypic changes and disease symptoms, which debilitates plants favoring infection establishment. Herein in this review, the novelty it will be the discussion about the strategies used by (\u002B) single strand RNA viruses to affect cellular processes and components to improve viral replication, in parallel to overcome plant defenses, favoring disease establishment by applying in one action using the same viral protein to coordinate viral replication and breaking down plant defense.

Upper respiratory infection (URI), largely due to adenovirus, is an endemic cause of morbidity in military training. Whether clinical presentations differ or excess morbidity results from coinfection is unclear. METHODS: The Center for Advanced Molecular Detection evaluates epidemiology and rapid diagnostics of respiratory pathogens in trainees with URI. From May 1, 2009, to November 30, 2009, demographic, clinical, and PCR data from throat and nasal specimens for adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 were prospectively collected. RESULTS: 375 trainees with URI enrolled and were tested for both adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 by PCR (median age 20; 89% male). Adenovirus PCR was positive in 72% (96% serotype E-4) and 2009 H1N1 in 20%. Males were more likely to have adenovirus and females more likely to have 2009 H1N1 (p = 0.047). Subjects with 2009 H1N1 presented an average of 1 week earlier in training, had shorter illness duration before enrollment, less sore throat, diarrhea, and fewer abnormal findings on throat exam. Coryza and cough were more common with 2009 H1N1 compared to adenovirus. Subjects with 2009 H1N1 were less likely to have adenovirus than those without, despite persistently high frequencies of adenovirus detections during peak 2009 H1N1 weeks (15% vs. 83%, p \u003C 0.01). Coinfection with adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 was rare (4%). Rates of hospitalization and pneumonia did not differ between the adenovirus, 2009 H1N1, or coinfected groups. CONCLUSION: Military trainees with 2009 H1N1 vs. adenovirus have differing clinical presentations, and males are more likely to have adenovirus. Despite high frequencies of adenovirus infection, coinfection with adenovirus and 2009 H1N1 is rare and apparently does not result in increased morbidity.","publish_time":"2014-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yun, Heather C.; Fugate, William H.; Murray, Clinton K.; Cropper, Thomas L.; Lott, Lisa; McDonald, J.

PQC is recognized for targeting the destruction of defective polypeptides, whereas regulated protein degradation mechanisms modulate the concentration of specific proteins in concert with physiological demands. For example, ion channel levels are physiologically regulated within tight limits, but a system-wide approach to define which degradative systems are involved is lacking. We focus on the Kir2.1 potassium channel because altered Kir2.1 levels lead to human disease and Kir2.1 restores growth on low-potassium medium in yeast mutated for endogenous potassium channels. Using this system, first we find that Kir2.1 is targeted for endoplasmic reticulum\u2013associated degradation (ERAD). Next a synthetic gene array identifies nonessential genes that negatively regulate Kir2.1. The most prominent gene family that emerges from this effort encodes members of endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). ERAD and ESCRT also mediate Kir2.1 degradation in human cells, with ESCRT playing a more prominent role. Thus multiple proteolytic pathways control Kir2.1 levels at the plasma membrane.","publish_time":"2014-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kolb, Alexander R.; Needham, Patrick G.; Rothenberg, Cari; Guerriero, Christopher J.; Welling, Paul A.; Brodsky, Jeffrey L.","journal":"Mol Biol Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/459f95218942f624446533e21c9ab2775b8efce3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/955a11ffa21e8ea71e2dd4ed9b59ebc6a8990535.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3890348.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890348/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PQC","ERAD","ESCRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["altered Kir2","ESCRT","multiple proteolytic pathways control Kir2","associated degradation","regulated protein degradation mechanisms","ion channel levels","ERAD","PQC","low-potassium medium","endogenous potassium channels","Protein quality control","prominent gene family","human disease","human cells","prominent role","synthetic gene array","system-wide approach","concentration of specific proteins","effort","yeast","members of endosomal sorting complex","concert","destruction of defective polypeptides","nonessential genes","growth","endoplasmic reticulum","physiological demands","transport","tight limits","degradative systems","example","plasma membrane","cellular health"],"language":"en"},

To study IgG RFs in patients with other autoimmune diseases, phage display antibody libraries from a hepatitis C virus infected patient with Sj\u00F6gren\u0027s syndrome were constructed. After panning, a specific clone RFL11 was isolated for characterization in advance. The binding activity and specificity of RFL11 to IgG Fc fragment were comparable to those of RFs previously isolated. The analysis with existed RF-Fc complex structures indicated the homology model of RFL11 is similar to IgM RF61 complex with high binding affinity of about 6 \u00D7 10(\u22128) M. This effect resulted from longer complementarity-determining region (CDR) combining key somatic mutations. In the RFL11-Fc interfaces, the CDR-H3 loop forms a finger-like structure extending into the bottom of Fc pocket and resulting in strong ion and cation-pi interactions. Moreover, a process of antigen-driven maturation was proven by somatically mutated VH residues on H2 and H3 CDR loops in the interfaces. Taken together, these results suggested that high affinity IgG RFs can be generated in patients with Sj\u00F6gren\u0027s syndrome and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease.","publish_time":"2013-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Yu-Ching; Tsai, Keng-Chang; Leu, Sy-Jye; Wang, Tuan-Jen; Liu, Chia-Yu; Yang, Yi-Yuan","journal":"ScientificWorldJournal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30556242d064131f0f2b645a727d42c55dc1c71e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3892945.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892945/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzE20","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RFL11-Fc interfaces","patients","IgG Fc fragment","high affinity IgG RFs","study IgG RFs","specificity of RFL11","Fc pocket","IgG rheumatoid factors","CDR-H3 loop","H3 CDR loops","homology model of RFL11","specific clone RFL11","Sj\u00F6gren\u0027s syndrome","high binding affinity","existed RF-Fc complex structures","phage display system","phage display antibody libraries","autoimmune diseases","rheumatoid arthritis","binding activity","IgM RF61 complex","hepatitis C virus infected patient","idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura","strong ion","mutated VH residues","H2","region","driven maturation","cation-pi interactions","pathogenesis","longer complementarity","characterization","important role","finger","analysis","results","key somatic mutations","process of antigen","effect","advance"],"language":"en"},

To evaluate their virucidal efficacy, these products must be tested with appropriate model viruses with different physico-chemical properties under conditions representing practical application in hospitals. The aim of this study was to evaluate a quantitative carrier assay. Furthermore, different putative model viruses like adenovirus type 5 (AdV-5) and different animal parvoviruses were evaluated with respect to their tenacity and practicability in laboratory handling. To evaluate the robustness of the method, some of the viruses were tested in parallel in different laboratories in a multi-center study. Different biocides, which are common active ingredients of surface disinfectants, were used in the test. After drying on stainless steel discs as the carrier, model viruses were exposed to different concentrations of three alcohols, peracetic acid (PAA) or glutaraldehyde (GDA), with a fixed exposure time of 5 minutes. Residual virus was determined after treatment by endpoint titration. All parvoviruses exhibited a similar stability with respect to GDA, while AdV-5 was more susceptible. For PAA, the porcine parvovirus was more sensitive than the other parvoviruses, and again, AdV-5 presented a higher susceptibility than the parvoviruses. All parvoviruses were resistant to alcohols, while AdV-5 was only stable when treated with 2-propanol. The analysis of the results of the multi-center study showed a high reproducibility of this test system. In conclusion, two viruses with different physico-chemical properties can be recommended as appropriate model viruses for the evaluation of the virucidal efficacy of surface disinfectants: AdV-5, which has a high clinical impact, and murine parvovirus (MVM) with the highest practicability among the parvoviruses tested.","publish_time":"2014-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rabenau, Holger F.; Steinmann, Jochen; Rapp, Ingrid; Schwebke, Ingeborg; Eggers, Maren","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db176113bbc82ec33681b60b7e2b6d5aa165723d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3903494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3903494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzMx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AdV","different putative model viruses","different animal parvoviruses","appropriate model viruses","different concentrations","different laboratories","Different biocides","different physico-chemical properties","virucidal efficacy of surface disinfectants","multi-center study","respect","GDA","alcohols","PAA","common active ingredients of surface disinfectants","high reproducibility","murine parvovirus","porcine parvovirus","highest practicability","test system","high clinical impact","quantitative carrier assay","conditions","transmission of bacteria","evaluation","adenovirus type","peracetic acid","broader preventive strategies","MVM","practical application","fungi","treatment","tenacity","glutaraldehyde","stainless steel discs","results","similar stability","products","fixed exposure time","medical institutions","minutes","hospitals","laboratory handling","higher susceptibility","conclusion","Residual virus","endpoint titration","analysis","method","propanol","robustness","aim"],"language":"en"},

As AIDS vaccine recipients will not be exposed to strains exactly matching any immunogens due to multiple HIV-1 quasispecies circulating in the human population worldwide, heterologous SHIV challenges are essential for realistic vaccine efficacy testing in primates. We assessed whether polyclonal IgG, isolated from rhesus monkeys (RMs) with high-titer nAbs (termed SHIVIG), could protect RMs against the R5-tropic tier-2 SHIV-2873Nip, which was heterologous to the viruses or HIV-1 envelopes that had elicited SHIVIG. RESULTS: SHIVIG demonstrated binding to HIV Gag, Tat, and Env of different clades and competed with the broadly neutralizing antibodies b12, VRC01, 4E10, and 17b. SHIVIG neutralized tier 1 and tier 2 viruses, including SHIV-2873Nip. NK-cell depletion decreased the neutralizing activity of SHIVIG 20-fold in PBMC assays. Although SHIVIG neutralized SHIV-2873Nip in vitro, this polyclonal IgG preparation failed to prevent acquisition after repeated intrarectal low-dose virus challenges, but at a dose of 400 mg/kg, it significantly lowered peak viremia (P = 0.001). Unexpectedly, single-genome analysis revealed a higher number of transmitted variants at the low dose of 25 mg/kg, implying increased acquisition at low SHIVIG levels. In vitro, SHIVIG demonstrated complement-mediated Ab-dependent enhancement of infection (C\u2019-ADE) at concentrations similar to those observed in plasmas of RMs treated with 25 mg/kg of SHIVIG. CONCLUSION: Our primate model data suggest a dual role for polyclonal anti-HIV-1 Abs depending on plasma levels upon virus encounter.","publish_time":"2014-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sholukh, Anton M; Byrareddy, Siddappa N; Shanmuganathan, Vivekanandan; Hemashettar, Girish; Lakhashe, Samir K; Rasmussen, Robert A; Watkins, Jennifer D; Vyas, Hemant K; Thorat, Swati; Brandstoetter, Tania; Mukhtar, Muhammad M; Yoon, John K; Novembre, Francis J; Villinger, Francois; Landucci, Gary; Forthal, Donald N; Ratcliffe, Sarah; Tuero, Iskra; Robert-Guroff, Marjorie; Polonis, Victoria R; Bilska, Miroslawa; Montefiori, David C; Johnson, Welkin E; Ertl, Hildegund C; Ruprecht, Ruth M","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/409e79f487deb871dcd3a35fc95da3432d9c6c2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3905655.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3905655/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SHIVIG","PBMC","Abs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SHIVIG neutralized SHIV","termed SHIVIG","elicited SHIVIG","low SHIVIG levels","SHIVIG neutralized tier","neutralizing activity of SHIVIG","HIV Gag","polyclonal anti-HIV","multiple HIV","low dose","Nip","heterologous SHIV challenges","intrarectal low-dose virus challenges","neutralizing antibodies b12","polyclonal IgG preparation","viruses","plasmas of RMs","induction of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies","R5-tropic tier","increased acquisition","plasma levels","virus encounter","AIDS vaccine recipients","realistic vaccine efficacy testing","dual role","Tat","envelope immunogen design","complement-mediated Ab-dependent enhancement of infection","Abs","higher number of transmitted variants","primate model data","human population","rhesus monkeys","fold","high-titer","binding","key goal","single-genome analysis","primates","Env of different clades","quasispecies","NK-cell depletion","VRC01","4E10","envelopes","concentrations similar","CONCLUSION","immunogens","BACKGROUND","PBMC assays","RESULTS","peak viremia","strains"],"language":"en"},

In [Image: see text] and [Image: see text], however, cmnm(5) appears as the final modification, whereas in the remaining tRNAs, the MnmEG products are converted into 5-methylaminomethyl (mnm(5)) through the two-domain, bi-functional enzyme MnmC. MnmC(o) transforms cmnm(5) into nm(5), whereas MnmC(m) converts nm(5) into mnm(5), thus producing an atypical network of modification pathways. We investigate the activities and tRNA specificity of MnmEG and the MnmC domains, the ability of tRNAs to follow the ammonium or glycine pathway and the effect of mnmC mutations on growth. We demonstrate that the two MnmC domains function independently of each other and that [Image: see text] and [Image: see text] are substrates for MnmC(m), but not MnmC(o). Synthesis of mnm(5)s(2)U by MnmEG-MnmC in vivo avoids build-up of intermediates in [Image: see text]. We also show that MnmEG can modify all the tRNAs via the ammonium pathway. Strikingly, the net output of the MnmEG pathways in vivo depends on growth conditions and tRNA species.

Since 2001, when Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was isolated in the Netherlands, the virus has been detected in several continents. Although reports have confirmed the prevalence of HMPV worldwide, data from Egypt remain limited. HMPV plays an important role in respiratory tract infections in individuals of all ages particularly in children. This study was aimed at estimating the prevalence of HMPV in patients with community-acquired lower respiratory infection in Upper Egypt and characterizing the circulating Egyptian HMPV strains for the first time. Materials and Methods. From 2005 to 2008, respiratory samples from 520 patients were analyzed for the presence of HMPV by real-time RT-PCR. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses were performed on partial fusion gene sequences of HMPV-positive patients. Results. HMPV-positive patients were detected in 2007-2008. The overall infection rate was 4%, while 57% of the patients were children. Sequence analysis demonstrated circulation of subgroup B viruses with predominance of lineage B2. Nucleotide sequence identity within lineage B1 was 98.8%\u201399.7% and higher than that in lineage B2 (94.3%\u2013100%). Three new amino acid substitutions (T223N, R229K, and D280N) of lineage B2 were observed. Conclusion. HMPV is a major viral pathogen in the Egyptian population especially in children. During 2007-2008, predominantly HMPV B2 circulated in Upper Egypt.","publish_time":"2014-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Embarek Mohamed, Mona S.; Reiche, Janine; Jacobsen, Sonja; Thabit, Amany G.; Badary, Mohamed S.; Brune, Wolfram; Schweiger, Brunhilde; Osmann, Ahmed H.","journal":"Int J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b76a42e03efa0717d687c09551b0fb2a3cf116b9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3941176.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941176/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HMPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HMPV B2","prevalence of HMPV","HMPV-positive patients","presence of HMPV","circulating Egyptian HMPV strains","predominance of lineage B2","children","partial fusion gene sequences of HMPV","Upper Egypt","lineage B1","lower respiratory infection","respiratory samples","respiratory tract infections","Egyptian population","Sequence analysis","Nucleotide sequence identity","overall infection rate","circulation of subgroup B viruses","T223N","R229K","individuals","community","important role","major viral pathogen","new amino acid substitutions","phylogenetic analyses","ages","D280N","data","real-time RT-PCR","Netherlands","Human metapneumovirus","reports","Materials","Methods","continents","study","Introduction","Results","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) is a life-threatening complication in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Lymphopenia has been associated with an increased risk of progression from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) to LRD. Methods. This study retrospectively analyzed the significance of lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, lung function, smoking history, corticosteroids, antiviral treatment, viral subtypes, and RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies for the progression to LRD in 181 HCT recipients with RSV URI. Results. In multivariable models, smoking history, conditioning with high-dose total body irradiation, and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) \u2264100/mm(3) at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with disease progression. No progression occurred in patients with ALCs of \u003E1000/mm(3) at URI onset. Lymphocyte engraftment dynamics were similar in progressors and nonprogressors. Pre- and posttransplant donor and posttransplant recipient RSV subtype-specific neutralizing antibody levels, RSV viral subtypes, and corticosteroids also were not significantly associated with LRD progression. Conclusions. Host and transplant related factors appear to determine the risk of progression to LRD more than viral factors. Dysfunctional cell-mediated immunity appears to be important in the pathogenesis of progressive RSV disease after HCT. A characterization of RSV-specific T-cell immunity is warranted.","publish_time":"2013-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yae-Jean; Guthrie, Katherine A.; Waghmare, Alpana; Walsh, Edward E.; Falsey, Ann R.; Kuypers, Jane; Cent, Anne; Englund, Janet A.; Boeckh, Michael","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7aed141810c0294eae2351f9cfbfc6d0d06b96b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3969549.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/209/8/1195/13804446/jit832.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lymphopenia"],"organizations":["RSV URI","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSV URI","LRD progression","disease progression","RSV viral subtypes","characterization of RSV","RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies","pathogenesis of progressive RSV disease","increased risk of progression","HCT recipients","viral factors","posttransplant recipient RSV subtype-specific neutralizing antibody levels","lower respiratory tract disease","time of URI onset","specific T-cell immunity","smoking history","corticosteroids","significance of lymphocyte engraftment dynamics","hematopoietic cell transplant","upper respiratory tract infection","Dysfunctional cell-mediated immunity","Respiratory syncytial virus","absolute lymphocyte count","posttransplant donor","related factors","conditioning","lung function","high-dose total body irradiation","antiviral treatment","life-threatening complication","multivariable models","nonprogressors","Host","study","patients","ALCs","Lymphopenia","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Family clusters with confirmed or suspected the new H7N9 virus infection were previously reported, but the family cluster of H7N9 virus infection in Shandong Province was first reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old man was admitted to Zaozhuang City Hospital with progressive respiratory distress and suspicion of impending acute respiratory distress syndrome on April 21. The chest radiography revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and pulmonary lesions. The second case, the first case\u2019s 4 year old son, was admitted to the same hospital on April 28 with fever and multiple patchy shadows in the bilateral lungs. Both of the two cases were confirmed to infect with H7N9 virus by the results of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (rRT-PCR), virus isolation and serum antibody titer. At the same time, one environment samples was detected positive for H7N9 virus in the living poultry market in Zaozhuang. The homologous analysis of the full genome sequence indicated that both viruses from the patients were almost genetically identical. The field epidemiology investigation showed that the two cases had no recognized exposure to poultry, but had the exposure to the environment. The second case had substantial unprotected close exposure to his ill father and developed symptoms seven days after his last contact with his father. After surgery, the index case and his son were discharged on May 16 and May 6, respectively. 11 close contacts of both patients were identified and tested negative both the throat swabs and the serum antibody. CONCLUSION: The infection of the index case probably resulted from contact with environmentally contaminated material. For the son, the probable infection source was from the index case during unprotected exposure, but the possibility from the environment or other sources could not be completely ruled out.","publish_time":"2014-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ti; Bi, Zhenqiang; Wang, Xianjun; Li, Zhong; Ding, Shujun; Bi, Zhenwang; Wang, Liansen; Pei, Yaowen; Song, Shaoxia; Zhang, Shengyang; Wang, Jianxing; Sun, Dapeng; Pang, Bo; Sun, Lin; Jiang, Xiaolin; Lei, Jie; Yuan, Qun; Kou, Zengqiang; Yang, Bin; Shu, Yuelong; Yang, Lei; Li, Xiyan; Lu, Kaishun; Liu, Jun; Zhang, Tao; Xu, Aiqiang","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8dcff92cc42c8b9833396a1df1a6712dd1d3e8d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3974040.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3974040/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Zaozhuang City"],"keyphrases":["new H7N9 virus infection","index case","case of human infection","family cluster of H7N9 virus infection","virus isolation","new H7N9 virus infected","CASE PRESENTATION","unprotected exposure","patients","recognized exposure","probable infection source","substantial unprotected close exposure","environment samples","cases","progressive respiratory distress","Zaozhuang City Hospital","serum antibody titer","year old son","ill father","bilateral lungs","close contacts","Family clusters","suspicion of impending acute respiratory distress syndrome","living poultry market","bilateral ground-glass opacities","chain reaction","results of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase","rRT-PCR","avian influenza","multiple patchy shadows","days","developed symptoms","year-old man","pulmonary lesions","chest radiography","Shandong Province","genome sequence","fever","throat swabs","case\u2019s","possibility","homologous analysis","viruses","people","field epidemiology investigation","contaminated material","China","sources","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","surgery"],"language":"en"},

Using a stringent cutoff of PPV and/or NPV\u22650.95, standard techniques yield few rules for sendout tests but several for in-house tests, mostly for repeat laboratory tests that are part of the complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. Most rules were clinically and pathophysiologically plausible, and several seemed clinically useful for informing pre-test probability of a given result. But overall, rules were unlikely to be able to function as a general substitute for actually ordering a test. Improving laboratory utilization will likely require different input data and/or alternative methods.","publish_time":"2014-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohammad, Fahim; Theisen-Toupal, Jesse C.; Arnaout, Ramy","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bd592988022fb91de64e0d4c287d3b04d864f8ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3986061.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3986061/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzEwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rules","recent laboratory test results","blood tests","repeat laboratory tests","given test result","sendout tests","in-house tests","laboratory utilization","Laboratory testing","NPV","standard techniques","given result","recent diagnoses","standard rule-mining techniques","complete blood count","stringent cutoff of PPV","gender","patient age","receiver-operator characteristic curve","single highest-volume medical activity","different input data","negative predictive value","basic metabolic panel","area","total","ROC AUCs","pre-test probability","years of electronic health records","alternative methods","reference interval","general substitute"],"language":"en"},

Existing methods based on free energy minimization tend to be very slow and are limited in the types of pseudoknots that they can predict. Incorporating known structural information can improve prediction accuracy; however, there are not many methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures that can incorporate structural information as input. There is even less understanding of the relative robustness of these methods with respect to partial information. RESULTS: We present a new method, Iterative HFold, for pseudoknotted RNA secondary structure prediction. Iterative HFold takes as input a pseudoknot-free structure, and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative HFold leverages strengths of earlier methods, namely the fast running time of HFold, a method that is based on the hierarchical folding hypothesis, and the energy parameters of HotKnots V2.0. Our experimental evaluation on a large data set shows that Iterative HFold is robust with respect to partial information, with average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increasing from roughly 54% to 79% as the user provides up to 40% of the input structure. Iterative HFold is much faster than HotKnots V2.0, while having comparable accuracy. Iterative HFold also has significantly better accuracy than IPknot on our HK-PK and IP-pk168 data sets. CONCLUSIONS: Iterative HFold is a robust method for prediction of pseudoknotted RNA secondary structures, whose accuracy with more than 5% information about true pseudoknot-free structures is better than that of IPknot, and with about 35% information about true pseudoknot-free structures compares well with that of HotKnots V2.0 while being significantly faster.

Although the term rat respiratory virus (RRV) was adopted to confer a putative viral etiology to the idiopathic pulmonary lesions, the etiology of this disease remains to be elucidated. Recently, inflammatory lesions have been observed in the lungs of immunocompetent laboratory rats similar to those previously described. Based on the latest evidence indicating that Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii), and not putative RRV, causes infectious interstitial pneumonia in laboratory rats, the present study investigated whether the pulmonary lesions observed were caused by P. carinii infection. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, free of known pathogens, were introduced into a rat colony positive for RRV-type lesions. Routine histopathological examinations were performed on the rat lung tissues following exposure. The presence of Pneumocystis organisms was confirmed using Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver (GMS) staining. At week 3 following introduction, a few small lymphoid aggregates were located adjacent to the edematous vascular sheath. By week 5, foci of dense perivascular lymphoid cuffing were observed. Multifocal lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia and prominent lymphoid perivascular cuffs were observed between week 7 and 10. GMS staining confirmed the presence of Pneumocystis cysts. Thus, the results of the present study demonstrated that P. carinii caused lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia in a group of laboratory rats. The observations strongly support the conclusion that P. carinii infection in immunocompetent laboratory rats causes the lung lesions that were previously attributed to RRV.","publish_time":"2014-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"KIM, HYUN-SOO; DO, SUNG-IM; KIM, YOUN WHA","journal":"Exp Ther Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4660da2a8603d28150c9d3de1a17c0333094087c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4079405.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4079405/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["group of laboratory rats","lung lesions","Pneumocystis carinii","RRV-type lesions","inflammatory lesions","carinii infection","infectious interstitial pneumonia","Multifocal lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia","lungs of immunocompetent laboratory rats similar","occurrence of idiopathic pulmonary lesions","putative RRV","week","dense perivascular lymphoid cuffs","prominent lymphoid perivascular cuffs","Male Sprague-Dawley rats","foci of dense perivascular lymphoid cuffing","small lymphoid aggregates","present study","rat lung tissues","presence of Pneumocystis organisms","GMS staining","presence of Pneumocystis cysts","rat colony positive","putative viral etiology","term rat respiratory virus","following introduction","Grocott\u2019s methenamine silver","free of known pathogens","conclusion","Routine histopathological examinations","exposure","latest evidence","edematous vascular sheath","results","disease","past decade","observations"],"language":"en"},

However, besides major successes achieved worldwide in infectious diseases control, most elimination/control programs remain frustrating in many tropical countries where specific biological and socio-economical features prevented implementation of disease control over broad spatial and temporal scales. Emblematic examples include malaria, yellow fever, measles and HIV. There is consequently an urgent need to develop affordable and sustainable disease control strategies that can target the core of infectious diseases transmission in highly endemic areas. DISCUSSION: Meanwhile, although most pathogens appear so difficult to eradicate, it is surprising to realize that human activities are major drivers of the current high rate of extinction among upper organisms through alteration of their ecology and evolution, i.e., their \u201Cniche\u201D. During the last decades, the accumulation of ecological and evolutionary studies focused on infectious diseases has shown that the niche of a pathogen holds more dimensions than just the immune system targeted by vaccination and treatment. Indeed, it is situated at various intra- and inter- host levels involved on very different spatial and temporal scales. After developing a precise definition of the niche of a pathogen, we detail how major advances in the field of ecology and evolutionary biology of infectious diseases can enlighten the planning and implementation of infectious diseases control in tropical countries with challenging economic constraints. SUMMARY: We develop how the approach could translate into applied cases, explore its expected benefits and constraints, and we conclude on the necessity of such approach for pathogen control in low-income countries.","publish_time":"2014-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roche, Benjamin; Broutin, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Choisy, Marc; Godreuil, Sylvain; de Magny, Guillaume Constantin; Chevaleyre, Yann; Zucker, Jean-Daniel; Breban, Romulus; Cazelles, Bernard; Simard, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1d9fb4d865696d3feee92d32b92dd73a390eb0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4124157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4124157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzIzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["implementation of infectious diseases control","pathogen control","control programs","implementation of disease control","evolutionary biology of infectious diseases","core of infectious diseases transmission","niche","tropical countries","sustainable disease control strategies","elimination of malaria","low-income countries","major drivers","major advances","major successes","approach","temporal scales","field of ecology","evolutionary studies","challenging economic constraints","worldwide eradication of smallpox","socio-economical features","current high rate of extinction","upper organisms","yellow fever","inter- host levels","spectacular achievements","planning","alteration","public health interventions","human activities","accumulation of ecological","immune system","century","expected benefits","applied cases","measles","Emblematic examples","dimensions","endemic areas","urgent need","vaccination","treatment","HIV","Western world","necessity","precise definition","pathogens","decades","DISCUSSION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: A scoping review method was used to address the recent progress of and challenges to disaster health management in China. Major health electronic databases were searched to identify English and Chinese literature that were relevant to the research aims. RESULTS: The review found that since 2003 considerable progress has been achieved in the health disaster response system in China. However, there remain challenges that hinder effective health disaster responses, including low standards of disaster-resistant infrastructure safety, the lack of specific disaster plans, poor emergency coordination between hospitals, lack of portable diagnostic equipment and underdeveloped triage skills, surge capacity, and psychological interventions. Additional challenges include the fragmentation of the emergency health service system, a lack of specific legislation for emergencies, disparities in the distribution of funding, and inadequate cost-effective considerations for disaster rescue.

Since infertility is a major concern following chemotherapy, it is important to characterize the drug-specific damage to the reproductive system to help find appropriate protective strategies. This study investigates the damage on neonatal mouse ovary maintained in vitro for 6 days, and exposed for 24 h (on Day 2) to clinically relevant doses of Docetaxel (DOC; low: 0.1 \u00B5M, mid: 1 \u00B5M, high: 10 \u00B5M). Furthermore, the study explores the putative protective action exerted by Tri-iodothyronine (T3; 10(\u22127) M). At the end of culture, morphological analyses and follicle counts showed that DOC negatively impacts on early growing follicles, decreasing primary follicle number and severely affecting health at the transitional and primary stages. Poor follicle health was mainly due to effects on granulosa cells, indicating that the effects of DOC on oocytes were likely to be secondary to granulosa cell damage. DOC damages growing follicles specifically, with no direct effect on the primordial follicle reserve. Immunostaining and western blotting showed that DOC induces activation of intrinsic, type II apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells; increasing the levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, while also inducing movement of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. T3 did not prevent the damage induced by the low dose of DOC. These results demonstrated that DOC induces a gonadotoxic effect on the mouse ovary through induction of somatic cell apoptosis, with no evidence of direct effects on the oocyte, and that the damaging effect is not mitigated by T3.","publish_time":"2014-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lopes, Federica; Smith, Rowena; Anderson, Richard A.; Spears, Norah","journal":"Mol Hum Reprod","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f33e644d058bc8373378c115878be06346298687.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4172173.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DOC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of DOC","DOC damages","\u00B5M","T3","granulosa cell damage","follicle counts","primary follicle number","Poor follicle health","cleaved poly","levels of cleaved caspase","primordial follicle reserve","gonadotoxic effect","evidence of direct effects","damaging effect","granulosa cells","drug-specific damage","study","induction of somatic cell apoptosis","ovarian somatic cells","neonatal mouse ovary","early growing follicles","affecting health","primary stages","low dose of","cancer therapy","cancer survivors","putative protective action","appropriate protective strategies","type","reproductive system","morphological analyses","activation of intrinsic","attention","Bax","quality of life","ADP-ribose","Tri-iodothyronine","relevant doses of Docetaxel","chemotherapy","mitochondria","movement of cytochrome C","polymerase","end of culture","western blotting","results","oocytes","major concern","infertility","cytosol","Advances","days","Immunostaining"],"language":"en"},

Reliable forecasts could also aid in the selection and implementation of interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality due to influenza illness. This paper reviews methods for influenza forecasting proposed during previous influenza outbreaks and those evaluated in hindsight. We discuss the various approaches, in addition to the variability in measures of accuracy and precision of predicted measures. PubMed and Google Scholar searches for articles on influenza forecasting retrieved sixteen studies that matched the study criteria. We focused on studies that aimed at forecasting influenza outbreaks at the local, regional, national, or global level. The selected studies spanned a wide range of regions including USA, Sweden, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Cuba. The methods were also applied to forecast a single measure or multiple measures. Typical measures predicted included peak timing, peak height, daily/weekly case counts, and outbreak magnitude. Due to differences in measures used to assess accuracy, a single estimate of predictive error for each of the measures was difficult to obtain. However, collectively, the results suggest that these diverse approaches to influenza forecasting are capable of capturing specific outbreak measures with some degree of accuracy given reliable data and correct disease assumptions. Nonetheless, several of these approaches need to be evaluated and their performance quantified in real-time predictions.","publish_time":"2013-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nsoesie, Elaine O; Brownstein, John S; Ramakrishnan, Naren; Marathe, Madhav V","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1861375d64fea0dd4e02843a049792058ce6140.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4181479.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4181479/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong","France","Cuba"],"keyphrases":["influenza forecasting","forecasting influenza outbreaks","measures of accuracy","influenza illness","multiple measures","Typical measures","previous influenza outbreaks","dynamics of influenza outbreaks","specific outbreak measures","precision of predicted measures","degree of accuracy","selected studies","diverse approaches","various approaches","peak height","peak timing","outbreak magnitude","reliable data","single measure","Reliable forecasts","paper reviews methods","single estimate of predictive error","articles","Singapore","Japan","Hong Kong","USA","Sweden","decision-making","wide range of regions","weekly case counts","United Kingdom","Google Scholar searches","Canada","morbidity","variability","correct disease assumptions","France","allocation of public health resources","PubMed","mortality","addition","implementation of interventions","selection","global level","performance","real-time predictions","Cuba","study criteria","results","differences","hindsight"],"language":"en"},

We report here a carbohydrate microarray analysis of a number of tumor-associated carbohydrates for their serum antibody reactivities and potential immunogenicity in humans. These are the precursors, cores and internal sequences of N-glycans. They are usually masked by other sugar moieties and belong to a class of glyco-antigens that are normally \u201Ccryptic\u201D. However, viral expression of these carbohydrates may trigger host immune responses. For examples, HIV-1 and SARS-CoV display Man9 clusters and tri- or multi-antennary type II (Gal\u03B21\u21924GlcNAc) chains (Tri/m-II), respectively; viral neutralizing antibodies often target these sugar moieties. We asked, therefore, whether prostate tumor expression of corresponding carbohydrates triggers antibody responses in vivo. Using carbohydrate microarrays, we analyzed a panel of human sera, including 17 samples from prostate cancer patients and 12 from men with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). We observed that IgG antibodies targeting the Man9- or Tri-/m-II-autoantigens are readily detectable in the sera of men with BPH, as well as those with cancer. Importantly, these antibody activities were selectively increased in prostate cancer patients.

Using a purified vesicle fusion assay, we show that XendoU functions on the surface of ER membranes to promote RNA cleavage and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) removal.

In this scenario, we investigate the temporal evolution and current status of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil. Specifically, we analyze records of annual absolute frequency of cases for more than 5000 cities for the first 33 years of the infection in Brazil. We found that (i) the annual absolute frequencies exhibit a logistic-type growth with an exponential regime in the first few years of the AIDS spreading; (ii) the actual reproduction number decaying as a power law; (iii) the distribution of the annual absolute frequencies among cities decays with a power law behavior; (iv) the annual absolute frequencies and the number of inhabitants have an allometric relationship; (v) the temporal evolution of the annual absolute frequencies have different profile depending on the average annual absolute frequencies in the cities. These findings yield a general quantitative description of the AIDS infection dynamics in Brazil since the beginning. They also provide clues about the effectiveness of treatment and control programs against the infection, that has had a different impact depending on the number of inhabitants of cities.

We describe the largest reported cluster of virologically confirmed H7N9 cases, comprised by a fatal Index case and two mild secondary cases. METHODS: A retrospective investigation was conducted in January of 2014. Three confirmed cases, their close contacts, and relevant environments samples were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral culture, and sequencing. Serum samples were tested by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. RESULTS: The Index case, a 49-year-old farmer with type II diabetes, who lived with his daughter (Case 2, aged 24) and wife (Case 3, aged 43) and his son-in-law (H7N9 negative). The Index case and Case 3 worked daily in a live bird market. Onset of illness in Index case occurred in January 13, 2014 and subsequently, he died of multi-organ failure on January 20. Case 2 presented with mild symptoms on January 20 following frequent unprotected bed-side care of the Index case between January 14 to 19, and exposed to live bird market on January 17. Case 3 became unwell on January 23 after providing bedside care to the Index case on January 17 to 18, and following the contact with Case 2 during January 21 to 22 at the funeral of the Index case. The two secondary cases were discharged on February 2 and 5 separately after early treatment with antiviral medication. Four virus strains were isolated and genome analyses showed 99.6 ~100% genetic homology, with two amino mutations (V192I in NS and V280A in NP). 42% (11/26) of environmental samples collected in January were H7N9 positive. Twenty-five close contacts remained well and were negative for H7N9 infection by RT-PCR and HI assay. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the Index case was infected from a live bird market while the two secondary cases were infected by the Index case during unprotected exposure. This family cluster is, therefore, compatible with non-sustained person-to-person transmission of avian influenza A/H7N9.

Presepsin is another biomarker that was recently evaluated and is elevated in patients with severe sepsis patients at risk of dying.

New studies have suggested strategies to identify patients at risk for resistant pathogen infection and therapies that optimize efficacy, without the overuse of broad-spectrum therapy in patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia. Innovative strategies using optimized dosing of antimicrobials, maximizing the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in critically ill patients, and newer routes of drug delivery are being explored to combat drug-resistant pathogens.

The increased emphasis in MSF on research led to the creation of an ethics review board (ERB) in 2001. The ERB has encouraged innovation in the review of proposals and the interaction between the ERB and the organization. This has led to some of the advances in ethics governance described in this paper. DISCUSSION: We first update our previous work from 2009 describing ERB performance and then highlight five innovative practices: \u2022 A new framework to guide ethics review \u2022 The introduction of a policy exempting a posteriori analysis of routinely collected data \u2022 The preapproval of \u201Cemergency\u201D protocols \u2022 General ethical approval of \u201Croutine surveys\u201D \u2022 Evaluating the impact of approved studies The new framework encourages a conversation about ethical issues, rather than imposing quasi-legalistic rules, is more engaged with the specific MSF research context and gives greater prominence to certain values and principles. Some of the innovations implemented by the ERB, such as review exemption or approval of generic protocols, may run counter to many standard operating procedures. We argue that much standard practice in research ethics review ought to be open to challenge and revision. Continued interaction between MSF researchers and independent ERB members has allowed for progressive innovations based on a trustful and respectful partnership between the ERB and the researchers. In the future, three areas merit particular attention. First, the impact of the new framework should be assessed. Second, the impact of research needs to be defined more precisely as a first step towards being meaningfully assessed, including changes of impact over time. Finally, the dialogue between the MSF ERB and the ethics committees in the study countries should be enhanced. SUMMARY: We hope that the innovations in research ethics governance described may be relevant for other organisations carrying out research in fragile contexts and for ethics committees reviewing such research.","publish_time":"2015-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schopper, Doris; Dawson, Angus; Upshur, Ross; Ahmad, Aasim; Jesani, Amar; Ravinetto, Raffaella; Segelid, Michael J; Sheel, Sunita; Singh, Jerome","journal":"BMC Med Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/000e43590fdd2e011cfadaa14e6c14f318d11bbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4351683.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351683/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSF","M\u00E9decins Sans Fronti\u00E8res","ERB","MSF ERB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MSF ERB","research ethics review","impact of research","research ethics governance","ethics committees","ERB performance","ethics review board","MSF researchers","specific MSF research context","independent ERB members","new framework","review of proposals","changes of impact","progressive innovations","impact of approved studies","General ethical approval","approval of generic protocols","ethical issues","Continued interaction","standard practice","standard operating procedures","greater prominence","emergency","counter","routine surveys","conversation","fragile contexts","creation","certain values","innovative practices","world\u2019s leading humanitarian medical organizations","data","principles","quasi-legalistic rules","policy","BACKGROUND","M\u00E9decins Sans Fronti\u00E8res","organisations","respectful partnership","exemption","introduction","posteriori analysis","previous work","future","areas","particular attention","preapproval","challenge","study countries","increased emphasis","revision","time","advances","paper","dialogue","DISCUSSION","SUMMARY","step"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to reveal the etiological role of TGEV in piglet diarrhea via molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: A TGEV-HX strain was isolated from China, and its complete genome was amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Sequence analysis indicated that it was conserved in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-non-translated regions, and there were no insertions or deletions in nonstructural genes, such as ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF3a, ORF3b, and ORF7, as well as in genes encoding structural proteins, such as the envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N) proteins. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the TGEV-HX strain was more similar to the TGEV Purdue cluster than to the Miller cluster.

The IBDV genome is formed by two dsRNA segments. The largest one harbors two partially overlapping open reading frames encoding a non-structural polypeptide, known as VP5, and a large polyprotein, respectively. VP5 is non-essential for virus replication. However, it plays a major role in IBDV pathogenesis. VP5 accumulates at the plasma membrane (PM) of IBDV-infected cells. We have analyzed the mechanism underlying the VP5 PM targeting. Updated topological prediction algorithm servers fail to identify a transmembrane domain within the VP5 sequence. However, the VP5 polycationic C-terminal region, harboring three closely spaced patches formed by two or three consecutive basic amino acid residues (lysine or arginine), might account for its PM tropism. We have found that mutations, either C-terminal VP5 deletions or replacement of basic amino acids by alanine residues, that reduce the electropositive charge of the VP5 C-terminus abolish PM targeting. Lipid overlay assays performed with an affinity-purified Flag-tagged VP5 (FVP5) protein version show that this polypeptide binds several phosphoinositides (PIP), exhibiting a clear preference for monophosphate species. Experiments performed with FVP5 mutant proteins lacking the polycationic domain demonstrate that this region is essential for PIP binding. Data gathered with IBDV mutants expressing C-terminal deleted VP5 polypeptides generated by reverse genetics demonstrate that the VP5-PIP binding domain is required both for its PM targeting in infected cells, and for efficient virus dissemination. Data presented here lead us to hypothesize that IBDV might use a non-lytic VP5-dependent cell-to-cell spreading mechanism.","publish_time":"2015-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00E9ndez, Fernando; de Garay, Tom\u00E1s; Rodr\u00EDguez, Dolores; Rodr\u00EDguez, Jos\u00E9 F.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ca8648d40bee3056b3f9840de6d34b57ed121d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4401730.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4401730/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBDV","PIP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VP5 PM targeting","VP5 sequence","VP5 C-terminus","C-terminal VP5 deletions","VP5-PIP binding domain","VP5 polycationic C-terminal region","C-terminal deleted VP5 polypeptides","non-lytic VP5-dependent cell","IBDV mutants","IBDV genome","IBDV pathogenesis","IBDV-infected cells","PM tropism","polycationic domain","transmembrane domain","virus replication","mechanism","Data","Infectious bursal disease virus","efficient virus dissemination","consecutive basic amino acid residues","replacement of basic amino acids","alanine residues","immunosuppressive disease","non-structural polypeptide","major role","FVP5 mutant proteins","major avian pathogen responsible","lysine","reverse genetics","open reading frames","affinity","electropositive charge","Birnaviridae family","harbors","clear preference","arginine","member","protein version","topological prediction algorithm servers","plasma membrane","juvenile chickens","Lipid overlay assays","monophosphate species","Experiments","spaced patches","Flag","mutations","dsRNA segments","phosphoinositides","large polyprotein"],"language":"en"},

Whether serum inflammatory markers can differentiate bacterial from virus infection in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring emergency department (ED) visits remains controversial. METHODS: Viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to identify the viruses in the oropharynx of patients with COPD exacerbations. The bacteria were identified by the semiquantitative culture of the expectorated sputum. The peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) counts, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and clinical symptoms were compared among patients with different types of infections. RESULTS: Viruses were isolated from 16 (22.2%) of the 72 patients enrolled. The most commonly identified viruses were parainfluenza type 3, influenza A, and rhinovirus. A total of 30 (41.7%) patients had positive bacterial cultures, with the most commonly found bacteria being Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Five patients (6.9%) had both positive sputum cultures and virus identification. The WBC, CRP, and PCT levels of the bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative groups were not statistically different. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with increased sputum volumes during the COPD exacerbations had higher risks of recurrent exacerbations in the 1-year period following the first exacerbation. CONCLUSION: WBC, CRP, or PCT could not differentiate between bacterial and viral infections in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring ED visits. Those with increased sputum during a COPD exacerbation had higher risks for recurrent exacerbations.","publish_time":"2015-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Chih-Hao; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Hu, Han-Chung; Huang, Chung-Chi; Kao, Kuo-Chin; Chen, Ning-Hung; Yang, Cheng-Ta; Tsai, Ying-Huang; Hsieh, Meng-Jer","journal":"Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15f57ae58cbfdd0616c570508ce0471bc4dacebe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4403815.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4403815/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQ4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED","Haemophilus"],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COPD exacerbations","oropharynx of patients","bacterial infections","bacteria-positive","WBC","viral infections","positive bacterial cultures","positive sputum cultures","CRP","higher risks of recurrent exacerbations","Viral culture","expectorated sputum","identified viruses","increased sputum volumes","ED visits","PCT levels","bacteria-negative groups","different types of infections","virus infection","virus identification","semiquantitative culture","Haemophilus influenzae","Haemophilus parainfluenzae","peripheral blood white blood cell","serum inflammatory markers","serum C-reactive protein","counts","common causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","emergency department","polymerase chain reaction","procalcitonin","PCR","parainfluenza type","METHODS","clinical symptoms","Multivariate analysis","year period","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","rhinovirus","RESULTS","total"],"language":"en"},

All scores are proposed for the estimation of survival probability after ECMO treatment for severe adult respiratory distress syndrome. METHODS: Data from 51 patients (2008 to 2013) were analyzed in this retrospective single-center study. A calculation of an adapted PRESERVE score, the RESP score as well as the score developed for externally retrieved ECMO patients was performed. RESULTS: Seventy one percent of patients received veno-venous (v-v) and 29% venous-arterial (v-a) ECMO support during the study period. Overall survival at 6 months was 55%, with a 61% survival rate for v-v cannulated patients and a 40% survival rate for v-a cannulated patients. The PRESERVE score discriminated survivors and non-survivors with an area under the curve of 0.67 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.82, P = 0.03). Analyzing survival prediction according to cannulation modus, the PRESERVE score and the RESP score significantly predicted survival for patients on v-v ECMO with an area under the curve of 0.75 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.92, P = 0.01) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.95, P = 0.035), respectively, while the scoring system developed for externally retrieved ECMO patients failed to predict survival in our study population.

METHODS: One thousand four hundred and seventy-eight infants in urban Ho Chi Minh City and 981 infants in a semi-rural district in southern Vietnam were enrolled at birth and followed to 1 year of age. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes were identified through clinic-based illness surveillance, hospital admissions and self-reports. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from infants with respiratory symptoms and tested for 14 respiratory pathogens using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Estimated incidence of ARI was 542 and 2691 per 1000 infant-years, and hospitalization rates for ARI were 81 and 138 per 1000 infant-years, in urban and semi-rural cohorts, respectively, from clinic- and hospital-based surveillance. However self-reported ARI episodes were just 1.5-fold higher in the semi-rural versus urban cohort, indicating that part of the urban\u2013rural difference was explained by under-ascertainment in the urban cohort. Incidence was higher in infants \u22656 months of age than \u003C6 months, but this was pathogen-specific. One or more viruses were detected in 53% (urban) and 64% (semi-rural) of samples from outpatients with ARI and in 78% and 66% of samples from hospitalized ARI patients, respectively. The most frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and bocavirus. ARI-associated hospitalizations were associated with longer stays and more frequent ICU admission than other infections. CONCLUSIONS: ARI is a significant cause of morbidity in Vietnamese infants and influenza virus A is an under-appreciated cause of vaccine-preventable disease and hospitalizations in this tropical setting.

This fact excludes a considerable portion of \u201Cgenomic dark matter\u201D with no significant similarity \u2014 and, consequently, no inferred homology to any other known sequence \u2014 from several downstream comparative genomic methods. In this review we compile several sequence metrics that do not rely on homology inference and can be used to compare nucleotide sequences and extract biologically meaningful information from them. These metrics comprise several compositional parameters calculated from sequence data alone, such as GC content, dinucleotide odds ratio, and several codon bias metrics. They also share other interesting properties, such as pervasiveness (patterns persist on smaller scales) and phylogenetic signal. We also cite examples where these homology-independent metrics have been successfully applied to support several bioinformatics challenges, such as taxonomic classification of biological sequences without homology inference. They where also used to detect higher-order patterns of interactions in biological systems, ranging from detecting coevolutionary trends between the genomes of viruses and their hosts to characterization of gene pools of entire microbial communities. We argue that, if correctly understood and applied, homology-independent metrics can add important layers of biological information in comparative genomic studies without prior homology inference.","publish_time":"2015-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coutinho, Tarcisio Jos\u00E9 Domingos; Franco, Gl\u00F3ria Regina; Lobo, Francisco Pereira","journal":"Comput Struct Biotechnol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/293e8a49b5c0ee33d5e1098b3f4ca9b613c516fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4446528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4446528/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["homology-independent metrics","prior homology inference","inferred homology","sequence metrics","comparative genomic studies","comparative genomic procedures","extraction of biological information","downstream comparative genomic methods","biological systems","sequence data","genomic dark matter","codon bias metrics","important layers of biological information","wealth of genomic data available","taxonomic classification of biological sequences","patterns of conservation","meaningful information","known sequence","detection of homologous regions","higher-order patterns of interactions","genomes of viruses","nucleotide sequences","dinucleotide odds ratio","GC content","characterization of gene pools of entire microbial communities","hosts","pervasiveness","smaller scales","considerable portion","coevolutionary trends","pivotal importance","compositional parameters","significant similarity","phylogenetic signal","bioinformatics challenges","variation","examples","interesting properties","mainstream procedure","fact","review"],"language":"en"},

Emerging evidence indicates that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-dependent Cl(\u2212) channel, modulates airway inflammation. Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) 3, a JAK family member that plays a central role in inflammatory responses, prominently contributes to the dysregulated innate immune response upon H5N1 attachment; therefore, this study aims to elucidate whether JAK3 activation induced by H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) inhibits cAMP-dependent CFTR channels. We performed short-circuit current, immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses of the airway epithelium in Jak3(\u002B/\u002B) and Jak3(\u002B/\u2212) mice. We demonstrate that H5N1 HA attachment inhibits cAMP-dependent CFTR Cl(\u2212) channels via JAK3-mediated adenylyl cyclase (AC) suppression, which reduces cAMP production. This inhibition leads to increased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03BAB) signaling and inflammatory responses. H5N1 HA is detected by TLR4 expressed on respiratory epithelial cells, facilitating JAK3 activation. This activation induces the interaction between TLR4 and G\u03B1i protein, which blocks ACs.

Using the murine norovirus (MNV) model, we have recently identified a network of host factors that interact with the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 extremities of the norovirus RNA genome. In addition to a number of well-known cellular RNA binding proteins, the molecular chaperone Hsp90 was identified as a component of the ribonucleoprotein complex. Here, we show that the inhibition of Hsp90 activity negatively impacts norovirus replication in cell culture. Small-molecule-mediated inhibition of Hsp90 activity using 17-DMAG (17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin) revealed that Hsp90 plays a pleiotropic role in the norovirus life cycle but that the stability of the viral capsid protein is integrally linked to Hsp90 activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both the MNV-1 and the HuNoV capsid proteins require Hsp90 activity for their stability and that targeting Hsp90 in vivo can significantly reduce virus replication. In summary, we demonstrate that targeting cellular proteostasis can inhibit norovirus replication, identifying a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of norovirus infections. IMPORTANCE HuNoV are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis around the world. RNA viruses, including noroviruses, rely heavily on host cell proteins and pathways for all aspects of their life cycle. Here, we identify one such protein, the molecular chaperone Hsp90, as an important factor required during the norovirus life cycle. We demonstrate that both murine and human noroviruses require the activity of Hsp90 for the stability of their capsid proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that targeting Hsp90 activity in vivo using small molecule inhibitors also reduces infectious virus production. Given the considerable interest in the development of Hsp90 inhibitors for use in cancer therapeutics, we identify here a new target that could be explored for the development of antiviral strategies to control norovirus outbreaks and treat chronic norovirus infection in immunosuppressed patients.","publish_time":"2015-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vashist, Surender; Urena, Luis; Gonzalez-Hernandez, Mariam B.; Choi, Jayoung; de Rougemont, Alexis; Rocha-Pereira, Joana; Neyts, Johan; Hwang, Seungmin; Wobus, Christiane E.; Goodfellow, Ian","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c715e7ac6f9be9ea6f0b80a6579c7a3426b41c1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4474317.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4474317/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["activity of Hsp90","norovirus replication","murine norovirus","norovirus outbreaks","molecular chaperone Hsp90","norovirus life cycle","development of Hsp90 inhibitors","mediated inhibition of Hsp90 activity","norovirus RNA genome","chronic norovirus infection","treatment of norovirus infections","HuNoV capsid proteins","stability","host cell proteins","molecular pathways","Human noroviruses","RNA viruses","small molecule inhibitors","Small-molecule","number of well-known cellular RNA binding proteins","IMPORTANCE HuNoV","viral capsid protein","cell culture","MNV","major cause of acute gastroenteritis","significant cause of acute gastroenteritis","cellular proteostasis","developed world","new target","infectious virus production","development of antiviral strategies","network of host factors","potential novel therapeutic target","important factor","aspects","pleiotropic role","cancer therapeutics","immunosuppressed patients","understanding","component","pathogenesis","addition","extremities","model","DMAG","ribonucleoprotein complex","dimethylaminoethylamino","inability","demethoxygeldanamycin","laboratory","summary"],"language":"en"},

In epidemiology, further clarifications of epidemiological functions are needed: while host roles may be defined, they are often used loosely, partly because of a lack of clarity on the relationships between a host\u2019s function and its epidemiological role. Here we focus on the definition of bridge hosts and their epidemiological consequences. Bridge hosts provide a link through which pathogens can be transmitted from maintenance host populations or communities to receptive populations that people want to protect (i.e., target hosts). A bridge host should (1) be competent for the pathogen or able to mechanically transmit it; and (2) come into direct contact or share habitat with both maintenance and target populations. Demonstration of bridging requires an operational framework that integrates ecological and epidemiological approaches. We illustrate this framework using the example of the transmission of Avian Influenza Viruses across wild bird/poultry interfaces in Africa and discuss a range of other examples that demonstrate the usefulness of our definition for other multi-host systems. Bridge hosts can be particularly important for understanding and managing infectious disease dynamics in multi-host systems at wildlife/domestic/human interfaces, including emerging infections.

Previously, we demonstrated that in the related cardiovirus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, a programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshift (\u22121 PRF) occurs at a conserved G_GUU_UUU sequence within the 2B-encoding region of the polyprotein open reading frame (ORF). Here we show that \u22121 PRF occurs at a similar site during translation of the TMEV genome. In addition, we demonstrate that a predicted 3\u2032 RNA stem-loop structure at a noncanonical spacing downstream of the shift site is required for efficient frameshifting in TMEV and that frameshifting also requires virus infection. Mutating the G_GUU_UUU shift site to inhibit frameshifting results in an attenuated virus with reduced growth kinetics and a small-plaque phenotype. Frameshifting in the virus context was found to be extremely efficient at 74 to 82%, which, to our knowledge, is the highest frameshifting efficiency recorded to date for any virus. We propose that highly efficient \u22121 PRF in TMEV provides a mechanism to escape the confines of equimolar expression normally inherent in the single-polyprotein expression strategy of picornaviruses. IMPORTANCE Many viruses utilize programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121 PRF) to produce different protein products at a defined ratio, or to translate overlapping ORFs to increase coding capacity. With few exceptions, \u22121 PRF occurs on specific \u201Cslippery\u201D heptanucleotide sequences and is stimulated by RNA structure beginning 5 to 9 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the slippery site. Here we describe an unusual case of \u22121 PRF in Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) that is extraordinarily efficient (74 to 82% of ribosomes shift into the alternative reading frame) and, in stark contrast to other examples of \u22121 PRF, is dependent upon a stem-loop structure beginning 14 nt downstream of the slippery site. Furthermore, in TMEV-based reporter constructs in transfected cells, efficient frameshifting is critically dependent upon virus infection. We suggest that TMEV evolved frameshifting as a novel mechanism for removing ribosomes from the message (a \u201Cribosome sink\u201D) to downregulate synthesis of the 3\u2032-encoded replication proteins.","publish_time":"2015-06-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Finch, Leanne K.; Ling, Roger; Napthine, Sawsan; Olspert, Allan; Michiels, Thomas; Lardinois, C\u00E9cile; Bell, Susanne; Loughran, Gary; Brierley, Ian; Firth, Andrew E.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/975a7b5f0f9a7f9a03195cb5cd1a633ecd4e36f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4524249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Theiler"],"organizations":["TMEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRF","efficient frameshifting","TMEV evolved frameshifting","ribosomal frameshifting","virus infection","frameshifting results","attenuated virus","Encephalomyocarditis virus","virus context","TMEV genome","slippery site","Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus","highest frameshifting efficiency","UUU shift site","RNA structure","similar site","TMEV-based reporter constructs","RNA stem-loop structure","GUU","ribosomes","sense single-stranded RNA viruses","polyprotein open reading frame","alternative reading frame","single-polyprotein expression strategy of picornaviruses","UUU sequence","novel mechanism","conserved G","genus Cardiovirus","related cardiovirus","confines of equimolar expression","transfected cells","reduced growth kinetics","defined ratio","family of positive","different protein products","region","noncanonical","overlapping ORFs","heptanucleotide sequences","small-plaque phenotype","Picornaviridae","message","translation","date","member","stark contrast","synthesis","ribosome sink","coding capacity","examples","knowledge","nucleotides","unusual case","encoded replication proteins","IMPORTANCE","addition","exceptions"],"language":"en"},

The most striking symptom of this emerging disease is the loss of scales. It was referred to as scale drop syndrome, but the etiology remained enigmatic. By using a next-generation virus discovery technique, VIDISCA-454, sequences of an unknown virus were detected in serum of diseased fish. The near complete genome sequence of the virus was determined, which shows a unique genome organization, and low levels of identity to known members of the Iridoviridae. Based on homology of a series of putatively encoded proteins, the virus is a novel member of the Megalocytivirus genus of the Iridoviridae family. The virus was isolated and propagated in cell culture, where it caused a cytopathogenic effect in infected Asian seabass kidney and brain cells. Electron microscopy revealed icosahedral virions of about 140 nm, characteristic for the Iridoviridae. In vitro cultured virus induced scale drop syndrome in Asian seabass in vivo and the virus could be reisolated from these infected fish. These findings show that the virus is the causative agent for the scale drop syndrome, as each of Koch\u2019s postulates is fulfilled. We have named the virus Scale Drop Disease Virus.

Waterfowl, the predominant reservoir of influenza viruses in nature, harbor precursors of different genetic lineages that have contributed to novel pandemic influenza viruses in the past. METHODS: Two duck influenza H5N2 viruses, DV518 and DV413, isolated through virological surveillance at a live-poultry market in Taiwan, showed phylogenetic relatedness but exhibited different replication capabilities in mammalian Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. This study characterizes the replication properties of the two duck H5N2 viruses and the determinants involved. RESULTS: The DV518 virus replicated more efficiently than DV413 in both MDCK and chicken DF1 cells. Interestingly, the infection of MDCK cells by DV518 formed heterogeneous plaques with great differences in size [large (L) and small (S)], and the two viral strains (p518-L and p518-S) obtained from plaque purification exhibited distinguishable replication kinetics in MDCK cells. Nonetheless, both plaque-purified DV518 strains still maintained their growth advantages over the plaque-purified p413 strain. Moreover, three amino acid substitutions in PA (P224S), PB2 (E72D), and M1 (A128T) were identified in intra-duck variations (p518-L vs p518-S), whereas other changes in HA (N170D), NA (I56T), and NP (Y289H) were present in inter-duck variations (DV518 vs DV413). Both p518-L and p518-S strains had the N170D substitution in HA, which might be related to their greater binding to MDCK cells. Additionally, polymerase activity assays on 293T cells demonstrated the role of vRNP in modulating the replication capability of the duck p518-L viruses in mammalian cells. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that intra-host phenotypic variation occurs even within an individual duck. In view of recent human infections by low pathogenic AIVs, this study suggests possible determinants involved in the stepwise selection of virus variants from the duck influenza virus population which may facilitate inter-species transmission.","publish_time":"2015-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yao-Tsun; Ko, Hui-Ying; Lee, Chang-Chun David; Lai, Ching-Yu; Kao, Chuan-Liang; Yang, Chinglai; Wang, Won-Bo; King, Chwan-Chuen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4518da3d4fdddd13a397a1fd68ce915512615db2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4532476.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4532476/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDCK","NP"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["duck p518","duck H5N2 viruses","duck influenza H5N2 viruses","p518-S strains","mammalian cells","avian influenza viruses","infection of MDCK cells","vs p518-S","duck influenza virus population","DV518 virus","individual duck","DV518 strains","T cells","novel pandemic influenza viruses","inter-duck variations","intra-duck variations","predominant reservoir of influenza viruses","DV518 vs DV413","interspecies-transmissible viruses","chicken DF1 cells","replication properties","replication capability","different replication capabilities","distinguishable replication kinetics","plaque purification","study","RESULTS","viral strains","stepwise selection of virus variants","view of recent human infections","possible determinants","pandemic potential","N170D substitution","low pathogenic AIVs","inter-species transmission","intra-host phenotypic variation","mammalian Madin-Darby Canine Kidney","harbor precursors of different genetic lineages","nature","heterogeneous plaques","phylogenetic relatedness","P224S","great differences","live-poultry market","Taiwan","size","virological surveillance","Y289H","global concerns of emerging","role of vRNP","growth advantages","E72D","PB2","amino acid substitutions","I56T","polymerase activity assays","A128T","BACKGROUND","past","METHODS","M1","Waterfowl","changes","greater binding","p413 strain","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

However, its clinical application is limited because of short half-life, drug resistance and cross-reactivity with the preexisting antibodies in HIV-infected patients. Using an artificial peptide strategy, we designed a peptide with non-native protein sequence, AP3, which exhibited potent antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of HIV-1 strains, including those resistant to T20, and had remarkably longer in vivo half-life than T20. While the preexisting antibodies in HIV-infected patients significantly suppressed T20\u2019s antiviral activity, these antibodies neither recognized AP3, nor attenuated its anti-HIV-1 activity. Structurally different from T20, AP3 could fold into single-helix and interact with gp41 NHR. The two residues, Met and Thr, at the N-terminus of AP3 form a hook-like structure to stabilize interaction between AP3 and NHR helices. Therefore, AP3 has potential for further development as a new HIV fusion inhibitor with improved antiviral efficacy, resistance profile and pharmacological properties over enfuvirtide. Meanwhile, this study highlighted the advantages of artificially designed peptides, and confirmed that this strategy could be used in developing artificial peptide-based viral fusion inhibitors against HIV and other enveloped viruses.","publish_time":"2015-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Xiaojie; Zhu, Yun; Ye, Sheng; Wang, Qian; Xu, Wei; Su, Shan; Sun, Zhiwu; Yu, Fei; Liu, Qi; Wang, Chao; Zhang, Tianhong; Zhang, Zhenqing; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Xu, Jianqing; Du, Lanying; Liu, Keliang; Lu, Lu; Zhang, Rongguang; Jiang, Shibo","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2fcc16391f946c99717b63ec9a24e5384aac381.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4541410.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4541410/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS","NHR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of HIV","anti-HIV","HIV-infected patients","new HIV fusion inhibitor","recognized AP3","broad spectrum of HIV","suppressed T20","preexisting antibodies","s antiviral activity","potent antiviral activity","artificial peptide strategy","AIDS patients","Enfuvirtide","improved antiviral efficacy","viral fusion inhibitors","resistance profile","drug resistance","short half-life","gp41 NHR","NHR helices","designed peptides","cross-reactivity","development","pharmacological properties","interaction","strains","non-native protein sequence","hook","single-helix","structure","N-terminus","enveloped viruses","Thr","advantages","clinical application","potential","current antiretroviral drugs","study","residues"],"language":"en"},

Clinical interventions have been inefficient due to the lack of knowledge for inflammatory pathogenesis in the virus-infected liver. We show that wild-type mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3), a model for viral FH, manifest with severe disease and high mortality in association with a significant elevation in IL-1\u03B2 expression in the serum and liver. Whereas, the viral infection in IL-1\u03B2 receptor-I deficient (IL-1R1 (-/-)) or IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) treated mice, show reductions in virus replication, disease progress and mortality. IL-1R1 deficiency appears to debilitate the virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 (FGL2) production in macrophages and CD45(\u002B)Gr-1(high) neutrophil infiltration in the liver. The quick release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the infected macrophages suggests a plausible viral initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Further experiments show that mice deficient of p47 (phox), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit that controls acute ROS production, present with reductions in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1\u03B2 secretion during viral infection, which appears to be responsible for acquiring resilience to viral FH. Moreover, viral infected animals in deficiencies of NLRP3 and Caspase-1, two essential components of the inflammasome complex, also have reduced IL-1\u03B2 induction along with ameliorated hepatitis. Our results demonstrate that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1\u03B2 axis institutes an essential signaling pathway, which is over activated and directly causes the severe liver disease during viral infection, which sheds light on development of efficient treatments for human viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases.","publish_time":"2015-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Sheng; Yang, Chengying; Diao, Bo; Huang, Xiaoyong; Jin, Meihua; Chen, Lili; Yan, Weiming; Ning, Qin; Zheng, Lixin; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd9f6d51d902c4493f797715278469d4c19bf65d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4569300.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4569300/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","subsequent IL","reduced IL","viral infected animals","human viral FH","virus-infected liver","Viral fulminant hepatitis","severe liver disease","severe disease","IL-1R1 deficiency","infected macrophages","plausible viral initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation","\u03B2 induction","\u03B2 expression","\u03B2 axis","\u03B2 secretion","\u03B2 receptor","high mortality","virus replication","deficiencies of NLRP3","disease progress","severe inflammatory diseases","murine hepatitis virus strain","reductions","acute ROS production","inflammasome complex","virus-induced fibrinogen","mice deficient of p47","ameliorated hepatitis","wild-type mice","inflammatory pathogenesis","essential components","oxidase subunit","NADPH","association","manifest","nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate","phox","development of efficient treatments","significant elevation","excessive inflammation","quick release of reactive oxygen species","protein","Caspase","light","lack of knowledge","CD45","FGL2","MHV","model","R antagonist","neutrophil infiltration","experiments","pathway","serum","resilience","Clinical interventions","results"],"language":"en"},

Flunarizine, a diphenylmethylpiperazine used to treat migraine, inhibited HCV cell entry in vitro and in vivo in a genotype-dependent fashion. Analysis of mosaic viruses between susceptible and resistant strains revealed that E1 and E2 glycoproteins confer susceptibility to flunarizine. Time of addition experiments and single particle tracking of HCV demonstrated that flunarizine specifically prevents membrane fusion. Related phenothiazines and pimozide also inhibited HCV infection and preferentially targeted HCV genotype 2 viruses. However, phenothiazines and pimozide exhibited improved genotype coverage including the difficult to treat genotype 3. Flunarizine-resistant HCV carried mutations within the alleged fusion peptide and displayed cross-resistance to these compounds, indicating that these drugs have a common mode of action. Conclusion: These observations reveal novel details about HCV membrane fusion. Moreover, flunarizine and related compounds represent first-in-class HCV fusion inhibitors that merit consideration for repurposing as cost-effective component of HCV combination therapies.","publish_time":"2015-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perin, Paula M.; Haid, Sibylle; Brown, Richard J.

All have a degree of technical complexity that limits deployment. Here, we evaluate the use of a novel device, which has no technical complexity and is easily deployable. RESULTS: An air-cleaning device powered by electrokinetic propulsion has been adapted to provide a universal method for collecting samples of the aerobiome. Plasma-induced charge in aerosol particles causes propulsion to and capture on a counter-electrode. The flow of ions creates net bulk airflow, with no moving parts. A device and electrode assembly have been re-designed from air-cleaning technology to provide an average air flow of 120 lpm. This compares favorably with current air sampling devices based on physical air pumping. Capture efficiency was determined by comparison with a 0.4 \u03BCm polycarbonate reference filter, using fluorescent latex particles in a controlled environment chamber. Performance was compared with the same reference filter method in field studies in three different environments. For 23 common fungal species by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), there was 100 % sensitivity and apparent specificity of 87 %, with the reference filter taken as \u201Cgold standard.\u201D Further, bacterial analysis of 16S RNA by amplicon sequencing showed equivalent community structure captured by the electrokinetic device and the reference filter. Unlike other current air sampling methods, capture of particles is determined by charge and so is not controlled by particle mass. We analyzed particle sizes captured from air, without regard to specific analyte by atomic force microscopy: particles at least as low as 100 nM could be captured from ambient air. CONCLUSIONS: This work introduces a very simple plug-and-play device that can sample air at a high-volume flow rate with no moving parts and collect particles down to the sub-micron range. The performance of the device is substantially equivalent to capture by pumping through a filter for microbiome analysis by quantitative PCR and amplicon sequencing.","publish_time":"2015-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gordon, Julian; Gandhi, Prasanthi; Shekhawat, Gajendra; Frazier, Angel; Hampton-Marcell, Jarrad; Gilbert, Jack A.","journal":"Microbiome","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5819ca9f401da096d402b6d1956a4fe6ba1c74b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4696304.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4696304/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["air samples","air-cleaning device","ambient air","average air flow","air-cleaning technology","physical air pumping","capture of particles","current air sampling devices","current air sampling methods","electrokinetic device","reference filter method","novel device","aerosol particles","\u03BCm polycarbonate reference filter","Capture efficiency","fluorescent latex particles","amplicon sequencing","variety of different sampling devices","electrokinetic propulsion","microbiome analysis","flow of ions","moving parts","Performance","high-volume flow rate","degree of technical complexity","quantitative PCR","bacterial analysis","different environments","universal method","electrode assembly","counter-electrode","particle sizes","particle mass","equivalent community structure","Plasma-induced charge","controlled environment chamber","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","specific analyte","S RNA","atomic force microscopy","regard","field studies","common fungal species","net bulk airflow","comparison","qPCR","study","work","deployment","sub-micron range","simple plug","BACKGROUND","gold standard","lpm","RESULTS","sensitivity","apparent specificity","aerobiome","use","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old previously healthy Taiwanese male came to our emergency department due to high fever, chills, general malaise and myalgia for about 4 days. An influenza rapid test from a throat swab was negative. Chest radiography showed mild left lung infiltration and levofloxacin was prescribed. However, progressive shortness of breath and respiratory failure developed 48 h later after hospitalization. Emergent intubation was performed and he was transferred to the intensive care unit where oseltamivir (Tamiflu, Roche) 75 mg orally twice daily was given immediately. In the intensive care unit, cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries. However, a markedly elevated cardiac enzyme level (Troponin I level was up to 71.01 ng/ml), a positive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings and no coronary artery stenosis led to the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. Subsequent real-time polymerase chain reaction of endotracheal aspirates was positive for influenza B. His condition gradually improved and he was successfully weaned from the ventilator on day 22. He was discharged without prominent complications on day 35. CONCLUSION: Influenza B infection is not always a mild disease. Early detection, early administration of antiviral agents, appropriate antibiotics and best supportive care, is still the gold standard for patients such as the one reported.","publish_time":"2016-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Hsu-Liang; Hsu, Jui-Feng; Tsai, Ying-Ming; Lin, Shang-Yi; Kuo, Hsuan-Fu; Yang, Chih-Jen","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bcdd638448092fa875a55d9ca28af926e1bcafb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4700760.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4700760/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozc3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Influenza B infection","intensive care unit","Influenza B virus infection","cardiac catheterization","influenza rapid test","mild disease","elevated cardiac enzyme level","best supportive care","positive cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings","mild left lung infiltration","Early detection","prominent complications","fatal complications","coronary artery stenosis","normal coronary arteries","early administration of antiviral agents","appropriate antibiotics","Subsequent real-time polymerase chain reaction of endotracheal aspirates","chills","emergency department","high fever","respiratory failure","general malaise","year-old","Chest radiography","throat swab","oseltamivir","Tamiflu","Troponin","healthy Taiwanese male","progressive shortness of breath","myalgia","levofloxacin","BACKGROUND","pulmonary cardiovascular involvement","gold standard","diagnosis of acute myocarditis","adults","Roche","condition","CONCLUSION","CASE PRESENTATION","patients","hospitalization","days","Emergent intubation","ventilator"],"language":"en"},

Sixty-four symptomatic adult volunteer outpatients were asked to cough 6 times into a cough aerosol collection system. Seventeen of these participants tested positive for influenza A virus by viral plaque assay (VPA) with confirmation by viral replication assay (VRA).

METHODS: The virulence of two clinical isolates of SAFV type 3 (SAFV-3) obtained from a patient with aseptic meningitis (AM strain) and acute upper respiratory inflammation (UR strain) was analyzed in neonatal and young mice utilizing virological, pathological, and immunological methods. RESULTS: The polyproteins of the strains differed in eight amino acids. Both clinical isolates were infective, exhibited neurotropism, and were mildly neurovirulent in neonatal ddY mice. Both strains pathologically infected neural progenitor cells and glial cells, but not large neurons, with the UR strain also infecting epithelial cells. UR infection resulted in longer inflammation in the brain and spinal cord because of demyelination, while the AM strain showed more infectivity in the cerebellum in neonatal ddY mice. Additionally, young BALB/c mice seroconverted following mucosal inoculation with the UR, but not the AM, strain.

Following viral internalization into endosomes, host cysteine proteases cleave the EBOV fusion glycoprotein (GP) to unmask the binding site for its intracellular receptor, the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). GP-NPC1 interaction is required for viral entry. Despite these and other recent discoveries, late events in EBOV entry following GP-NPC1 binding and culminating in GP-catalyzed fusion between viral and cellular lipid bilayers remain enigmatic. A mechanistic understanding of EBOV membrane fusion has been hampered by the failure of previous efforts to reconstitute fusion in vitro or at the cell surface. This report describes an assay to monitor initial steps directly in EBOV membrane fusion\u2014triggering of GP and virus-cell lipid mixing\u2014by single virions in live cells. Fusogenic triggering of GP occurs predominantly in Rab7-positive (Rab7(\u002B)) endosomes, absolutely requires interaction between proteolytically primed GP and NPC1, and is blocked by key GP-specific neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. Unexpectedly, cysteine protease inhibitors do not inhibit lipid mixing by virions bearing precleaved GP, even though they completely block cytoplasmic entry by these viruses, as shown previously. These results point to distinct cellular requirements for different steps in EBOV membrane fusion and suggest a model in which host cysteine proteases are dispensable for GP fusion triggering after NPC1 binding but are required for the formation of fusion pores that permit genome delivery.","publish_time":"2016-02-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spence, Jennifer S.; Krause, Tyler B.; Mittler, Eva; Jangra, Rohit K.; Chandran, Kartik","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/748d4c57fe1acc8d9d97cf574f7dea5296f9386c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4752599.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4752599/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzgyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Niemann-Pick C1"],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GP fusion triggering","GP-catalyzed fusion","GP-NPC1 binding","GP-NPC1 interaction","precleaved GP","EBOV fusion glycoprotein","EBOV entry","proteolytically primed GP","mechanistic understanding of EBOV membrane fusion","formation of fusion pores","viral entry","key GP-specific neutralizing antibodies","host cysteine proteases","cellular lipid bilayers","virus-cell lipid mixing","viral internalization","binding site","endosomes","cytoplasmic entry","distinct cellular requirements","cysteine protease inhibitors","different steps","intricate use of host factors","initial steps","single virions","genome delivery","Ebola virus","cell surface","Rab7-positive","intracellular receptor","cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1","late events","model","therapeutic potential","lysosomal pathway","recent discoveries","live cells","failure of previous efforts","initiate infection","assay","results","report","viruses","Fusogenic"],"language":"en"},

Here we ask how this non-Markovian nature of an outbreak process affects the branching trees describing that process, with particular focus on tree shapes. We simulate Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes and compare different patterns of infectivity over time. We find that memory (non-Markovian-ness) in the process can have a pronounced effect on the shapes of the outbreak\u2019s branching pattern. However, memory also has a pronounced effect on the sizes of the trees, even when the duration of the simulation is fixed. When the sizes of the trees are constrained to a constant value, memory in our processes has little direct effect on tree shapes, but can bias inference of the birth rate from trees.

He was admitted to the intensive care unit and initially treated with a 1-day course of intravenous quinine followed by oral chloroquine and primaquine. The patient\u2019s platelet count increased as early as 4 hours after treatment inception and the clinical course was favourable and uneventful. DISCUSSION: This case report, along with a review of published cases focusing on the relationship between thrombocytopaenia and severe P. vivax malaria, suggests that the prognostic role of severe thrombocytopaenia is ambiguous in absence of severe haemorraghic complications and its use as diagnostic criterion of malaria severity may lead to overestimation of severe P. vivax malaria cases. CONCLUSION: Due to the lack of high quality studies it is at present unclear if severe thrombocytopaenia in the setting of P. vivax malaria should be considered indicative of severe malaria.","publish_time":"2016-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antinori, Spinello; Corona, Alberto; Ridolfo, Anna Lisa; Galimberti, Laura; Ricaboni, Davide; Milazzo, Laura; Corbellino, Mario","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49ddbf7c497973ebf3d8401bb2ee28e21e802e2d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4759958.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4759958/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzgzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["indicative of severe malaria","vivax malaria severity","vivax malaria cases","severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria","overestimation of severe","prognostic role of severe thrombocytopaenia","diagnostic criterion of malaria severity","absence of severe haemorraghic complications","frequent malaria-associated haematologic alteration","case report","case of imported","Plasmodium parasites","clinical course","review of published cases","day course of intravenous quinine","use","World Health Organization criteria","Pakistan","relationship","setting of","lack of high quality studies","oral chloroquine","treatment inception","year old man","hours","primaquine","disease","humans","indicator of","patient\u2019s platelet count","intensive care unit","DISCUSSION","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

These prophylactics have been used for centuries but still to this day only three main design strategies exist: (1) live attenuated virus (LAV) vaccines, (2) killed or inactivated virus vaccines, (3) and subunit vaccines of the three, the most efficacious vaccines remain LAVs. LAVs replicate in relevant tissues, elicit strong cellular and humoral responses, and often confer lifelong immunity. While this vaccine strategy has produced the majority of successful vaccines in use today, there are also important safety concerns to consider with this approach. In the past, the development of LAVs has been empirical. Blind passage of viruses in various cell types results in the accumulation of multiple attenuating mutations leaving the molecular mechanisms of attenuation unknown. Also, due to the high error rate of RNA viruses and selective pressures of the host environment, these LAVs, derived from such viruses, can potentially revert back to wild-type virulence. This not only puts the vaccinee at risk, but if shed can put those that are unvaccinated at risk as well. While these vaccines have been successful there still remains a need for a rational design strategy by which to create additional LAVs. One approach for rational vaccine design involves increasing the fidelity of the viral RdRp. Increased fidelity decreases the viral mutational frequency thereby reducing the genetic variation the virus needs in order to evade the host imposed bottlenecks to infection. While polymerase mutants exist which decrease viral mutation frequency the mutations are not in conserved regions of the polymerase, which doesn\u2019t lend itself toward using a common mutant approach toward developing a universal vaccine strategy for all RNA viruses. We have identified a conserved lysine residue in the active site of the PV RdRp that acts as a general acid during nucleotide incorporation. Mutation from a lysine to an arginine results in a high fidelity polymerase that replicates slowly thus creating an attenuated virus that is genetically stable and less likely to revert to a wild-type phenotype. This chapter provides detailed methods in which to identify the conserved lysine residue and evaluating fidelity and attenuation in cell culture (in vitro) and in the PV transgenic murine model (in vivo).","publish_time":"2015-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Cheri A.; August, Avery; Arnold, Jamie J.; Cameron, Craig E.","journal":"Vaccine Technologies for Veterinary Viral Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bbed13119c94625bd7b7b92a945ca65dc20afc7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4772695.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772695/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inactivated virus vaccines","efficacious vaccines","subunit vaccines","majority of successful vaccines","high fidelity polymerase","LAVs replicate","development of LAVs","additional LAVs","attenuated virus","conserved lysine residue","rational design strategy","rational vaccine design","Increased fidelity","viral RdRp","universal vaccine strategy","viral mutation frequency","viral mutational frequency","high error rate of RNA viruses","Blind passage of viruses","conserved regions","PV RdRp","polymerase mutants","infection","risk","main design strategies","common mutant approach","wild-type virulence","wild-type phenotype","host environment","cell culture","arginine results","various cell types","accumulation of multiple attenuating mutations","molecular mechanisms of attenuation unknown","PV transgenic murine model","selective pressures","active site","relevant tissues","genetic variation","humoral responses","order","general acid","day","need","nucleotide incorporation","shed","important safety concerns","bottlenecks","effective way","lifelong immunity","detailed methods","centuries","chapter","vaccinee","infectious diseases","past","prophylactics"],"language":"en"},

Although their contribution to host defense against bacteria in vivo has been demonstrated, comparable studies of their antiviral activity in vivo are lacking. Using a mouse model deficient in activated \u03B1-defensins in the small intestine, we show that Paneth cell \u03B1-defensins protect mice from oral infection by a pathogenic virus, mouse adenovirus 1 (MAdV-1). Survival differences between mouse genotypes are lost upon parenteral MAdV-1 infection, strongly implicating a role for intestinal defenses in attenuating pathogenesis. Although differences in \u03B1-defensin expression impact the composition of the ileal commensal bacterial population, depletion studies using broad-spectrum antibiotics revealed no effect of the microbiota on \u03B1-defensin-dependent viral pathogenesis. Moreover, despite the sensitivity of MAdV-1 infection to \u03B1-defensin neutralization in cell culture, we observed no barrier effect due to Paneth cell \u03B1-defensin activation on the kinetics and magnitude of MAdV-1 dissemination to the brain. Rather, a protective neutralizing antibody response was delayed in the absence of \u03B1-defensins. This effect was specific to oral viral infection, because antibody responses to parenteral or mucosal ovalbumin exposure were not affected by \u03B1-defensin deficiency. Thus, \u03B1-defensins play an important role as adjuvants in antiviral immunity in vivo that is distinct from their direct antiviral activity observed in cell culture.","publish_time":"2016-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gounder, Anshu P.; Myers, Nicolle D.; Treuting, Piper M.; Bromme, Beth A.; Wilson, Sarah S.; Wiens, Mayim E.; Lu, Wuyuan; Ouellette, Andr\u00E9 J.; Spindler, Katherine R.; Parks, William C.; Smith, Jason G.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f880418303ca5f21c858eca97f076216919bb4b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4774934.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4774934/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["absence of \u03B1","activated \u03B1-defensins","\u03B1-defensin neutralization","\u03B1-defensin deficiency","Paneth cell \u03B1-defensins","Paneth cell \u03B1-defensin activation","\u03B1-defensin expression impact","oral infection","cell culture","parenteral MAdV","oral viral infection","antiviral immunity","antiviral activities","magnitude of MAdV","sensitivity of MAdV","direct antiviral activity","barrier effect","mouse genotypes","mouse adenovirus","mouse model deficient","dependent viral pathogenesis","antibody responses","depletion studies","important role","comparable studies","attenuating pathogenesis","Survival differences","protective neutralizing antibody response","composition","ileal commensal bacterial population","mice","abundant antimicrobial peptides","broad-spectrum antibiotics","pathogenic virus","mucosal ovalbumin exposure","antifungal","adjuvants","microbiota","kinetics","small intestine","intestinal defenses","contribution","host defense","dissemination","brain"],"language":"en"},

These novel mAbs could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against Ebola virus infection.","publish_time":"2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qi; Gui, Miao; Niu, Xuefeng; He, Shihua; Wang, Ruoke; Feng, Yupeng; Kroeker, Andrea; Zuo, Yanan; Wang, Hua; Wang, Ying; Li, Jiade; Li, Chufang; Shi, Yi; Shi, Xuanling; Gao, George F.; Xiang, Ye; Qiu, Xiangguo; Chen, Ling; Zhang, Linqi","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf114390000199ac4f7c1f1f07c3320f0cb38657.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4867612.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4867612/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzkyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["Ebola virus infections","Q411","novel mAbs","Q206","mouse model of Ebola virus infection","live Ebola virus independent of complement","Q314","novel epitopes","GP binding","deadly hemorrhagic disease","single particle EM","potent neutralizing activities","antigen-specific single B cell sorting","sequential immunization of Chinese rhesus macaques","pseudo","therapeutic interventions","mutagenesis analysis","vaccines","promising candidates","head","significant protection","glycan cap","West Africa","surface glycoprotein","monoclonal antibodies","therapeutics","GP1 subunit","regulatory approval","receptor NPC1","Treatment","isolation"],"language":"en"},

Resistant birds, although infected, were unable to transmit virus to contact birds, as ultimately only the presence of a sustained cloacal shedding (and not oropharyngeal shedding) was critical for transmission. Restriction of within-bird transmission of virus occurred in the resistant line, with intra-nares or cloacal infection resulting in only local shedding and failing to transmit fully through the gastro-intestinal-pulmonary tract. Resistance to infection was independent of adaptive immune responses, including the expansion of specific IFN\u03B3 secreting cells or production of influenza-specific antibody. Genetic resistance to a novel H9N2 virus was less robust, though significant differences between host genotypes were still clearly evident.

This was the case during the swine flu (H1N1) pandemic of 2009\u20132010, and governments were forced to make decisions despite these uncertainties. While many countries chose to implement wide scale vaccination programmes, few accomplished their vaccination goals. Many research studies aiming to explore barriers and facilitators to vaccine uptake have been conducted in the aftermath of the pandemic, including several qualitative studies. AIMS: 1. To explore public attitudes to the swine flu vaccine in different countries through a review of qualitative primary studies. 2. To describe and discuss the implications drawn by the primary study authors. METHODS: Systematic review of qualitative research studies, using a broadly comparative cross case-study approach. Study quality was appraised using an adaptation of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) quality assessment tool. RESULTS: The review indicates that the public had varying opinions about disease risk and prevalence and had concerns about vaccine safety. Most primary study authors concluded that participants were uninformed, and that more information about the disease and the vaccine would have led to an increase in vaccine uptake. We find these conclusions problematic. We suggest instead that people\u2019s questions and concerns were legitimate given the uncertainties of the situation at the time and the fact that the authorities did not have the necessary information to convince the public. Our quality assessment of the included studies points to a lack of reflexivity and a lack of information about study context. We suggest that these study weaknesses are tied to primary study authors\u2019 lack of acknowledgement of the uncertainties surrounding the disease and the vaccine. CONCLUSION: While primary study authors suggest that authorities could increase vaccine uptake through increased information, we suggest instead that health authorities should be more transparent in their information and decision-making processes in future pandemic situations.

Understanding the importance of stem cells on skin wound healing, here we evaluate the biological significance of M-CSF on skin wound healing. In an in vivo mouse skin excisional wound model, we found that SSEA-positive stem cells were present in wounded but not normal skin. After isolating skin cells from either normal or wounded skin by collagenase digestion, and analyzing the SSEA-1 positive cells by flow cytometry, we found a significant increase in the number of SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin. Topical application of M-CSF in skin wounds accelerated healing remarkably, while application of M-CSF-neutralizing antibody slowed wound healing. Furthermore, injection of EGFP-labeled hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells generated from M-CSF treated splenocytes resulted in EGFP-labeled cells being enriched in the skin wound site and further differentiated into functional organ-specific cells. Together, these data demonstrated that M-CSF makes a significant contribution to the healing process by inducing hematopoietic cell dedifferentiation into stem cells.","publish_time":"2016-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yunyuan; Jalili, Reza Baradar; Ghahary, Aziz","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6907124581ac28f6712e3676396cfc4a3b8a9502.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4929493.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4929493/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["skin cells","positive cells","skin wound healing","wounded skin","CSF","importance of stem cells","multipotent stem cells","SSEA-positive stem cells","normal skin","skin wound site","subset of hematopoietic cells","skin wounds","hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells","healing process","mouse skin excisional wound model","functional organ-specific cells","hematopoietic cell dedifferentiation","number of SSEA","complicated process","significant increase","significant contribution","injection of EGFP","Topical application","collaborative efforts of different cell lineages","flow cytometry","collagenase digestion","proliferating fibroblast releasable factor","biological significance","splenocytes","antibody","recent studies","data"],"language":"en"},

The additives were given twice daily with the meal from day 2 to day 14 post\u2010natum. The presence of infectious agents was proved in fecal samples of all calves. Intestinal infections with rotavirus (30.8% of the calves) predominated compared to those with coronavirus (7.1%), E. coli F5 (1.5%) and cryptosporidia (24.2%). In contrast to earlier studies, the manifestation of diarrhoea did not differ significantly between the five groups. Only the growth rate of the calves between day 2 and day 14 of life as a measure of their welfare showed treatmentFspecific differences. The control group (I) showed the lowest body weight gain of about 5.8 kg (SD 5.0), whereas in the treated groups it averaged 6.3 kg (SD 4.1, p = 0,60; group II), 6.8 kg (SD 4.3, p = 0.36; group III), 6.9 kg (SD 4.7, p = 0.61; group IV) and 7.7 kg (SD 4.9, p = 0.08; group V).

Obviously, the feeding of antibodies from colostrum or from egg powder does increase the mean body weight gain. The feeding of probiotics alone has nearly no effect. However, in the combination with specific egg antibodies probiotics seem to have a synergistic effect. In serum from the 198 newborn calves the IgG concentration averaged 4.9 mg/ml serum (SD 3.3). From 93 dams of these calves a sample of the first colostrum could be obtained showing a mean IgG concentration of 22.0 mg/ml (SD 11.0). IgG levels in the colostrum and in the serum have been positively correlated (r = 0.37, p \u003C 0.05). Calves with a high intensity of diarrhoea had a significantly (p = 0.01) lower mean IgG serum level (3.7 mg/ml; n = 36; SD 2.5) than calves without diarrhoea (5.6 mg/ml; n = 75; SD 4.0).","publish_time":"2008-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Von Erhard, M.

Thus, in spite of noticeable differences in entry, this short stretches of membranotropic peptides are probably associated with similar entry\u2010related events.

This was subject to malacological studies from the late 19th century onwards. Herein, we provide the first thorough taxonomic survey of Lake Gacko including revisions of several taxa. A total amount of 1,077 specimens was obtained from 17 samples, comprising at least 11 freshwater and 2 terrestrial gastropod species and 6 bivalve species. So far, none of the described taxa has been documented outside the Dinarides and the DLS, respectively. The fauna shows variable overlap with other paleolakes of the DLS, proofing once more the complex biogeographic patchwork of this system. The current paleoenvironmental reconstructions are tested and refined by application of a statistical analysis. This confirms the partition of the sedimentary history of Lake Gacko into three major depositional phases responding to astronomically forced climate changes. The low diverse mollusk assemblage in the initial phase, with abundant pulmonate and rissooid gastropods, signals a more arid climate with lowered lake level. During the second interval, the fauna becomes more diverse with common rissooid and melanopsid gastropods. It represents a more humid interval with enhanced precipitation and increased lake level, entailing the installation of a perennial lacustrine environment. The final phase is a return to arid conditions with the same elements as in the initial pulmonate\u2010rissooid assemblage. The sphaeriid Pisidium vukovici n. sp. is introduced as new species.

Human Data Synthesis \u2013 The role of apoptosis in health and disease is a rapidly growing area of research in human medicine. Apoptosis has been identified as a component of human autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer\u0027s disease, cancer, and sepsis. Veterinary Data Synthesis \u2013 Research data available from the veterinary literature pertaining to apoptosis and its role in diseases of small animal species is still in its infancy. The majority of veterinary studies focus on oncologic therapy. Most of the basic science and human clinical research studies use human blood and tissue samples and murine models. The results from these studies may be applicable to small animal species. Conclusions \u2013 Apoptosis is the complex physiologic process of programmed cell death. The pathophysiology of apoptosis and disease is only now being closely evaluated in human medicine. Knowledge of the physiologic mechanisms by which tissues regulate their size and composition is leading researchers to investigate the role of apoptosis in human diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disease and sepsis. Because it is a multifaceted process, apoptosis is difficult to target or manipulate therapeutically. Future studies may reveal methods to regulate or manipulate apoptosis and improve patient outcome.","publish_time":"2008-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Brien, Mauria A.; Kirby, Rebecca","journal":"J Vet Emerg Crit Care (San Antonio)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/96ebbc1edb02f41e823df884d8031c7fb8c6577e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169302.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169302/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjsyNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Human Data Synthesis","Veterinary Data Synthesis \u2013 Research"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of apoptosis","human diseases","human medicine","biology of apoptosis","pathophysiology of apoptosis","Human Data Synthesis","human blood","human clinical research studies","Veterinary Data Synthesis","component of human autoimmune diseases","majority of veterinary studies","veterinary literature pertaining","Research data available","Alzheimer\u0027s disease","Data Sources","Future studies","diseases of small animal species","cancer","health","sepsis","growing area of research","physiologic mechanisms","multifaceted process","complex physiologic process of programmed cell death","tissue samples","Pubmed","size","references","basic science","murine models","leading researchers","composition","tissues","appropriate articles","oncologic therapy","Conclusions","methods","Knowledge","results","infancy","patient outcome","Objective"],"language":"en"},

We have investigated long\u2010term anti\u2010TNF\u2010\u03B1 treatment with infliximab with respect to TNF\u2010\u03B1 gene activity and protein levels in the blood of RA patients and disease activity score (DAS). Methods: TNF\u2010\u03B1 mRNA and plasma protein in RA patients (n = 29) and healthy controls (n = 24) was determined before and during treatment with infliximab (3 mg/kg) using real\u2010time quantitative reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) and high sensitivity enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The disease activity of the patients was assessed as DAS value. Results: The TNF\u2010\u03B1 mRNA levels of RA patients at baseline were higher than that of the control group (P = 0.0135) but were significantly reduced after initiation of treatment (P \u003C 0.001). Low mRNA levels were sustained throughout the 54 weeks of the study. Baseline protein levels of RA patients were similar to the control group. After 2 weeks of treatment, the protein levels were significantly elevated from baseline (P = 0.0353) and increased throughout week 14. Clinical improvement for all RA patients was found upon infliximab treatment, as a reduction in DAS values (P \u003C 0.001). The increase in protein and reduction in DAS value from week 2\u201314 was also correlated (P = 0.0374). Conclusion: During infliximab treatment of RA patients, there is an accumulation in immune\u2010reactive TNF\u2010\u03B1 protein in blood plasma and simultaneously a reduction in TNF\u2010\u03B1 gene expression in PBMC, which may in part explain the beneficial course of RA symptoms.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hjelmevik, T.

Drawbacks linked to the use of alum, such as the formation of granuloma at the site of injection, have led to suggestions of novel allergen carriers. An alternative carrier is 2 \u03BCm carbohydrate\u2010based particles (CBPs). In mouse, allergen\u2010coupled CBPs have been demonstrated to skew the allergen\u2010specific immune response towards a Th1\u2010like activity (Gr\u00F6nlund et al. Immunology, 2002). We here coupled the recombinant major cat allergen Fel d 1 to CBPs (CBP\u2010Fel d 1) by cyanogen\u2010bromide activation, resulting in covalent binding. The effect of CBP\u2010Fel d 1 on monocyte\u2010derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from healthy human blood donors was studied. We found that the majority of the CD1a(\u002B) MDDCs were capable of taking up FITC\u2010labelled CBP\u2010Fel d 1, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Furthermore, incubation with CBP\u2010Fel d 1 resulted in an upregulation of the costimulatory molecule CD86 on the MDDCs, which was not observed with Fel d 1 or CBPs alone. Finally, CBP\u2010Fel d 1 induced a fivefold increase in the release of the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010\u03B1 and a fourfold increase in the release of the chemokine interleukin\u20108 from MDDCs.

The small size and stability of the virus makes it suitable for mapping of the full breath and the kinetics of the cellular immune responses following acute viral infection. Methods: Five patients with acute primary B19 infection were included in the study and followed consecutively for up to 200 weeks. Cellular immune responses were mapped by IFN\u03B3 enzyme\u2010linked immunospot to overlapping peptides spanning the whole B19 genome. Results: In all five acutely infected patients, we were able to monitor the kinetics of a strong specific cellular immune reaction. Responses peaked at levels of 850\u20131850 SFC/million PBMCs, roughly corresponding to 0.3\u20130.6% B19\u2010specific CD8(\u002B) cells circulating in peripheral blood at 10\u201380 weeks post\u2010infection. The responses in individual patients were directed to three or four different peptide pools, and the specificity was confined to the same CD8 epitopes present in the pools throughout the follow\u2010up period. The majority of responses were directed to the virus nonstructural protein, only two patients showed any response to the capsid proteins, elicited by the same epitope in both cases. Conclusion: The cellular immune responses to acute B19 infection are surprisingly narrow in distribution and remain at high levels for up to 80 weeks post\u2010infection. The initial epitope specificity is maintained, and the majority of responses target the virus nonstructural protein, which is not included in vaccine preparations, evaluated against the infection.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Isa, A.; Norbeck, O.; P\u00F6hlmann, C.; Tolfvenstam, T.","journal":"Scand J Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/151b3b30704a6f7731c1397615aa5fc69ef228c9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169519/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular immune responses","acute B19 infection","majority of responses","acute primary B19 infection","weeks post\u2010infection","B19 genome","acute viral infection","Human parvovirus B19","infected patients","individual patients","strong specific cellular immune reaction","virus nonstructural protein","kinetics","specific CD8","initial epitope specificity","high levels","different peptide pools","CD8 epitopes present","IFN\u03B3 enzyme","peptides","distribution","significant pathology","mild self\u2010limiting disease","linked immunospot","stability","cells","breath","ubiquitous pathogen","Background","peripheral blood","long\u2010term persistence","capsid proteins","small size","mapping","Methods","Conclusion","follow\u2010up period","SFC","vaccine preparations","study","PBMCs","Results","cases"],"language":"en"},

To this end, a large number of peptide antigens derived from TAA have been applied in immunotherapeutic trials for the treatment of various malignancies, e.g. cancers of the breast, prostate and kidney, in addition to haematological cancers. In some cases the response rates have been impressive and no adverse autoimmunity have been observed. A major strategic difficulty associated with these trials relates to the choice of best\u2010suited peptide antigens. The vast majority of the antigens described thus far is not vital for survival and growth of the tumour cells, and immunoselection of antigen\u2010loss variants may therefore prove to be an additional obstacle for the clinical applicability of most of the known peptide epitopes. In this respect, the development of acquired antigen loss during immunotherapy has been demonstrated in several cases. Obviously, the development of loss\u2010variant tumour cells implies that these cells acquire a pronounced growth advantage and are left unaffected by further treatment. Ideally, target antigens should be derived from proteins required for survival and growth of tumour cells, as antigens with these characteristics would not be inflicted by the development of loss\u2010variant tumour cells. In this respect, several inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are universally expressed among tumours and play an important role in tumour cell escape from apoptosis. We have characterized spontaneous T\u2010cell reactivity against IAP\u2010derived peptides in cancer patients. From the IAP survivin, we have characterized peptides restricted to the Class I molecules HLA\u2010A1, A2, A3, A11, B7 and B35. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that survivin\u2010specific T cells infiltrate metastatic lesions and that isolated survivin\u2010specific CTLs are capable of killing HLA\u2010matched tumour cells. Survivin\u2010derived peptides are now in clinical trial, and continued work in our lab has demonstrated that other IAPs are targets for spontaneous T\u2010cell reactivity in cancer patients.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andersen, M.

Several lines of evidence demonstrate that donor T cells are involved in the antitumour effects observed after BMT. Thus, patients receiving T\u2010cell\u2010depleted BMT have a higher risk of leukaemia relapse compared to patients receiving nonmanipulated BMT, and patients experiencing graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease (GVHD) have a lower risk of disease relapse than patients who do not experience GVHD. Although the importance of donor T cells for the curative action of BMT has been established, the exact mechanisms and molecules involved in this graft\u2010versus\u2010tumour effect remain largely unknown. In a recently initiated project, we have conducted a longitudinal study of T\u2010cell clonotypes in patients who received peripheral blood stem cell grafts after nonmyeloablative conditioning. Peripheral blood samples were obtained sequentially after transplant, and the mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated and cryopreserved. CD8(\u002B) T cells were isolated from the MNCs by use of immunomagnetic beads or FACS and analysed for the presence of clonally expanded cells by T\u2010cell receptor clonotype mapping based on RT\u2010PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Using this gel\u2010based methodology, clonally expanded T cells were monitored after transplant and compared to the clinical data of the patients. The preliminary results demonstrates the presence of clonally expanded CD8(\u002B) T cells at all time points analysed. Furthermore, a number of clonotypes persisted for more than 6 months, and other clonotypes emerged during this period. The appearance of newly emerged clonotypes which coincided with clinical GVHD could indicate a role for these T cells in the pathogenesis of GVHD.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kollgaard, T.

Purified monocytes and monocyte\u2010derived DCs were stimulated with UV\u2010inactivated gram\u2010positive (Lactobacillus plantarum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis) and gram\u2010negative (Escherichia coli and Veillonella parvula) bacterial strains.

In contrast, DCs secreted high amounts of IL\u201012p70, TNF, IL\u20106 and IL\u201010 in response to E. coli and V. parvula but were practically unresponsive to L. plantarum and B. adolescentis. The lack of response to the gram\u2010positive strains correlated with a lower surface expression of Toll\u2010like reseptor 2 (TLR2) on DCs compared to monocytes. The surface expression of TLR4 on DCs was undetectable when analysed by flow cytometry, but blocking this receptor decreased the TNF production in response to V. parvula, indicating that low TLR4 expression on DCs is sufficient to mount an inflammatory response to gram\u2010negative bacteria. IFN\u2010\u03B3 increased the expression of TLR4 on DCs and also potentiated the cytokine response to gram\u2010negative bacteria. Our results indicate that, when monocytes differentiate into DCs, their ability to respond to different commensal bacteria dramatically changes, thereby becoming unresponsive to probiotic gram\u2010positive bacteria. These results may have important implications for the capacity of different groups of commensal bacteria to regulate mucosal and systemic immunity.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Karlsson, H.; Larsson, P.; Wold, A.

The diversity of waterborne diseases and their severity is greatest in tropical environments. Since most of the countries in tropical climates are underdeveloped, with large populations that are undernourished, ill\u2010housed, with poor medical services, waterborne diseases may have a much greater effect on public health in the tropics than in temperate areas. Universally, tropical areas accept water maximum contaminant levels developed by temperate nations, despite the obvious differences in tropical climates. High densities of total and fecal coliform bacteria have been detected in pristine streams and in groundwater samples collected from many tropical parts of the world, even in epiphytic vegetation 10 m above ground in the rain forest of Puerto Rico. Nucleic acid (DNA) analyses of Escherichia coli from pristine tropical environs has indicated that they are identical to clinical isolates of E. coli. Many tropical source waters have been shown to have enteric pathogens in the complete absence of coliforms. Diffusion chamber studies with E. coli at several tropical sites reveal that this bacterium can survive indefinitely in most freshwaters in Puerto Rico. An evaluation of methods for the enumeration of fecal coliforms showed that currently used media have poor reliability as a result of large numbers of false positive and false negative results when applied to tropical water samples. Total and fecal coliform bacteria are not reliable indicators of recent biological contamination of waters in tropical areas. Fecal streptococci and coliphages in tropical waters violate the same underlying assumptions of indicator assays as the coliforms. Anaerobic bacteria like Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium perfringens show some promise in terms of survival, but not in ease of enumeration and media specificity.

Police, fire, and other Emergency Medical Services (EMS) comprise the core first responders to nearly any emergency, and these personnel have numerous responsibilities throughout the Airport Emergency Plan (AEP). The National Incident Management System, created after 9/11, is the standard method of managing disasters, incidents, and other events in the United States. It is based on three principles: Incident Command System (ICS), Multi-Agency Coordination, and Public Information. The five functions of ICS are command, operations, planning, logistics, and finance/administration. For some incidents, an intelligence/investigative function is added.","publish_time":"2016-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Price, Jeffrey C.; Forrest, Jeffrey S.","journal":"Practical Airport Operations, Safety, and Emergency Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a4a7334c27a788fa682dbcccae4b8f84e041f41.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7170197.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7170197/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Emergency Medical Services","EMS","Public Information","ICS"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["airport emergency management","Airport Emergency Planning","emergency medical response","Emergency Medical Services","airport emergencies","Incident Command System","Public Information","public notifications","functions of ICS","resource management","core functions","National Incident Management System","incidents","firefighting","law enforcement","Multi-Agency Coordination","numerous responsibilities","C3","communications","logistics","EMS","operations","evacuation","events","disasters","cases","control","personnel","principles","overview","Protective Actions","shelter","intelligence","investigative function","standard method","finance","responders","AEP"],"language":"en"},

Lesions of the alimentary mucosa appear well before the onset of diarrhoea and are characterized by a release of mucus in the anterior part of the intestine. By the time diarrhoea begin, different types of rotavirus particules are present in the enterocytes of the mucosa, and mucus contents of distal intestine are affected. At this stage of the disease, the virus causes epithelial cells in the small intestine to desquamate and changes the secretion of mucus in the small as well as the large intestine. The very intense virus multiplication is completed within 18 h. Intracellular rotavirus disappear very quickly after the onset of diarrhoea, and cannot be detected even during the acute phase of the disease. Regeneration of the mucosa takes place slowly, and the cellular and structural lesions are still visible more than 4 days after the diarrhoea stopped.","publish_time":"2006-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dubourguier, H.C.; Mandard, O.; Contrepois, M.; Gouet, P.","journal":"Ann Inst Pasteur Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30eae3d28d8186a69cd90f6a7bf796ea2184fe6f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["onset of diarrhoea","small intestine","time diarrhoea","large intestine","non-fatal diarrhoea","mucus contents of distal intestine","Intracellular rotavirus","alimentary mucosa","disease","release of mucus","secretion of mucus","different types of rotavirus particules","gnotobiotic calves","structural lesions","faeces of diarrheic calves","intense virus multiplication","enterocytes","epithelial cells","dehydration","Experimental infection","place","acute phase","Regeneration","stage","days"],"language":"en"},

This hypothesis implies that factors in the environment can determine the initiation of allergic sensitization and can potentially influence the clinical manifestations and severity of disease. Because the prevalence of atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy have increased worldwide in the past several decades, and there is no mechanism for changes in population genetics over this short period of time, changes in the human environment are most likely responsible for these trends. From this line of reasoning, it follows that if the factors responsible for the increasing prevalence can be identified, then there would be an opportunity to develop strategies to reverse these trends. It also would be helpful to identify infants who are at risk for developing allergy, so that preventive strategies could be used most effectively. In this article, studies to determine the contributions of genetics and the environment to the development of allergic diseases in childhood are explored. In addition, progress in identifying risk factors for allergy and preventive therapies for those children at risk are also addressed.","publish_time":"1999-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gern, James E.; Lemanske, Robert F.","journal":"Immunol Allergy Clin North Am","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa331b7e1988ad3e1a765e457d65941d1c1b7b66.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141141.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["food allergy","risk factors","factors responsible","allergic rhinitis","human environment","development of allergic diseases","changes","current paradigm of allergy pathogenesis","prevalence of atopic diseases","preventive strategies","trends","initiation of allergic sensitization","atopic dermatitis","population genetics","contributions of genetics","preventive therapies","increasing prevalence","asthma","short period of time","mechanism","individuals","children","progress","clinical manifestations","severity of disease","studies","childhood","addition","genetic predisposition","decades","article","infants","past","hypothesis","line of reasoning","opportunity","allergens"],"language":"en"},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 302 newborns were recruited. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken when the patients had a respiratory infection, as well as in the visits for vaccination at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months. RT-nested PCR assays were performed to detect 16 viruses. RESULTS: A total of 1293 samples were analysed (1005 healthy controls and 288 respiratory infections). Samples taken during routine check-ups were positive in 30.8% of cases, while those with respiratory infection were positive in 77.8%, P \u003C .001 (OR: 3, 95% CI: 2.4\u20133.8). A total of 239 (79%) infants had at least 1 positive respiratory viral infection detected. The most frequent virus (71%) was rhinovirus (RV). Recurrent wheezing was found in 27 (11%) children during their first year of life (1.2 episodes, SD 2.9). Recurrent wheezing was present in 58.3% of patients admitted to hospital during their first viral infection, vs. 8.6% of infants when the first infection was mild or who had asymptomatic viral detection, P \u003C .001 (OR: 2.18; 95% CI: 1.05\u20134.5). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, severe respiratory infections leading to hospitalisation in the first months of life are risk factors for developing wheezing, but not in the case of mild RV infections.","publish_time":"2017-07-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Calvo, Cristina; Aguado, Isabel; Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, Mar\u00EDa Luz; Ruiz-Chercoles, Esther; D\u00EDaz-Martinez, Eloisa; Alba\u00F1il, Rosa Mar\u00EDa; Campelo, Olga; Olivas, Antonio; Mu\u00F1\u00F3z-Gonzalez, Luisa; Pozo, Francisco; Fernandez-Arroyo, Rosa; Fernandez-Rinc\u00F3n, Adelaida; Calderon, Ana; Casas, Inmaculada","journal":"An Pediatr (Engl Ed)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146761.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146761/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive respiratory viral infection","viral respiratory infections severe","asymptomatic respiratory viral infections","severe respiratory infections","development of recurrent wheezing","PATIENTS","total","asymptomatic viral detection","year of life","case of mild RV infections","cohort of infants","months of life","samples","high risk","hospital admission","risk factors","hospitalisation","study","birth","healthy controls","series","RT-nested PCR assays","routine check-ups","episodes","METHODS","cases","data","unselected populations","main aim","rhinovirus","CONCLUSIONS","newborns","nasopharyngeal aspirate","SD","RESULTS","children","frequent virus","visits","vaccination","viruses","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

One way to do so is to compare each story in a stream of news stories to a notable event. In other words, the problem of detecting notable news can be defined as a ranking task; given a trusted source of notable events and a stream of candidate news stories, we aim to answer the question: \u201CWhich of the candidate news stories is most similar to the notable one?\u201D. We employ different combinations of features and learning to rank (LTR) models and gather relevance labels using crowdsourcing.

The existing Chinese NER methods are mostly based on word segmentation, or use the character sequences as input. However, using a single granularity representation would suffer from the problems of out-of-vocabulary and word segmentation errors, and the semantic content is relatively simple. In this paper, we introduce the self-attention mechanism into the BiLSTM-CRF neural network structure for Chinese named entity recognition with two embedding. Different from other models, our method combines character and word features at the sequence level, and the attention mechanism computes similarity on the total sequence consisted of characters and words. The character semantic information and the structure of words work together to improve the accuracy of word boundary segmentation and solve the problem of long-phrase combination. We validate our model on MSRA and Weibo corpora, and experiments demonstrate that our model can significantly improve the performance of the Chinese NER task.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Ning; Zhong, Jiang; Li, Qing; Zhu, Jiang","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee4ab7f8e37fa579ea0927a623a1a2e8bfb917f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148203.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148203/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Entity Recognition"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["word segmentation errors","word features","Chinese NER task","accuracy of word boundary segmentation","structure of words","character semantic information","Entity Recognition","existing Chinese NER methods","character sequences","self-attention mechanism","total sequence","sequence level","attention mechanism computes similarity","semantic content","BiLSTM-CRF neural network structure","natural language processing","NLP","tasks","MSRA","Weibo corpora","experiments","vocabulary","performance","problems","models","characters","embedding","single granularity representation","phrase combination","paper","input"],"language":"en"},

In this chapter, a new measurement system is introduced to inform HIV/AIDS control cross the globe. All countries with data available on area size, total population and total number of persons living with HIV (PLWH) were included, yielding a sample of 148 countries. Four indicators, including the total count, population-based p rate, geographic area-based g rate and population and geographic area-based pg rate were used as a 4D system to describe the global HIV epidemic. The total PLWH count provided data informing resource allocation for individual countries to improve HIV/AIDS care; and the top five countries with highest PLWH count were South Africa, Nigeria, India, Kenya, and Mozambique. Information from the remaining three indicators provided a global risk profile of the HIV epidemic, supporting HIV/AIDS prevention programming strategies. Five countries with highest p rates were Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Zimbabwe; five countries with highest g rates were Swaziland, Malawi, Lesotho, Rwanda, and Uganda; and five countries with highest pg rates were Barbados, Swaziland, Lesotho, Malta, and Mauritius. According to pg rates, two HIV hotspots (south and middle Africa and Caribbean region) and one HIV belt across Euro-Asian were identified. In addition to HIV/AIDS, the 4D measurement system can be used to describe morbidity and mortality for many diseases across the globe. We recommend the use of this measurement system in research to address significant global health and epidemiologic issues.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Xinguang; Yu, Bin; Chen, (Din) Ding-Geng","journal":"Statistical Methods for Global Health and Epidemiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50ce9a285e435e8328a3b270255ffc31a865e51e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152722.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7152722/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PLWH"],"locations":["South Africa","Nigeria","India","Kenya","Mozambique","Swaziland","Botswana","Malawi","Lesotho","Malta","Mauritius","Caribbean"],"keyphrases":["global HIV epidemic","impact of HIV","HIV belt","HIV hotspots","AIDS epidemic","individual countries","highest pg rates","total population","total count","AIDS care","AIDS control","highest g rates","highest p rates","total PLWH count","highest PLWH count","Swaziland","Lesotho","significant global health","South Africa","D system","D measurement system","geographic area-based pg rate","population-based p rate","global risk profile","geographic area-based g rate","collaborative global effort","new measurement system","typical global health question","AIDS prevention programming strategies","area size","total number of persons","middle Africa","indicators","globe","data available","resource allocation","Barbados","Botswana","Nigeria","research","Malawi","Zimbabwe","India","Caribbean region","Kenya","Malta","Rwanda","epidemiologic issues","Uganda","mortality","diseases","morbidity","Euro-Asian","chapter","use","Mozambique","Information","Mauritius","addition","sample"],"language":"en"},

The majority of these infections are benign and run a self-limited course, although they often cause patients significant discomfort. A small but still significant number of cases will be due to a more serious process, such as a deep neck space infection. It is important to recognize the clinical and radiographic differences between these patients and patients with simple pharyngitis and triage them appropriately. Failure to recognize and treat patients with more serious infections can have dire consequences and can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. It is also important to recognize that certain populations of patients will be more susceptible to atypical infections.

Since tumor cells are poor antigen-presenting cells, cross-presentation of tumor antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) is essential for the generation of tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses. A number of polymer-based nanomedicines have been developed to deliver genes into DCs, primarily by incorporating tumor-specific, antigen-encoding plasmid DNA with polycationic molecules to facilitate DNA loading and intracellular trafficking. Direct in vivo targeting of plasmid DNA to DC surface receptors can induce high transfection efficiency and long-term gene expression, essential for antigen loading onto major histocompatibility complex molecules and stimulation of T-cell responses.

Despite the exciting efficacy observed in preclinical studies, DNA vaccines have faced challenges in inducing strong immune responses in humans. This unexpected poor immunogenicity has severely hampered the translation of DNA vaccines from investigational medications to licensed products. To overcome this obstacle, tremendous efforts have been made to improve antigen expression and enhance immunogenicity. Among these endeavors, in vivo DNA electroporation (EP) has proved to be a breakthrough technology capable of mediating efficient DNA uptake and resulting in enhanced antigen expression and vaccine immunogenicity. EP-mediated DNA delivery has become one of the major platforms used in clinical trials to evaluate DNA vaccines in humans. In this chapter, in addition to EP delivery, other progress made in DNA vaccine development including plasmid optimization, antigen design, and immunologic adjuvants is also reviewed. Finally, the use of DNA vaccines in the context of clinical trials for infectious diseases and cancer immunotherapy is summarized. Specifically, the strategies that allow DNA vaccines to overcome antigenic diversity for viral infection and break immune tolerance for cancer therapy are explored. Based on the advantages of DNA vaccines and the immense progress, led by the electroporation-mediated vaccine delivery, DNA vaccines appear to have the potential to fundamentally transform the vaccine field, providing important benefits for preventing and curing diseases.","publish_time":"2017-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Li; Morrow, Matthew P.; Bagarazzi, Mark","journal":"Handbook of Electroporation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3a7eac49b7d92e651c347e1c3661c76ca0b40f51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153459.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153459/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjsxMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["advantages of DNA vaccines","translation of DNA vaccines","use of DNA vaccines","DNA electroporation","DNA vaccine development","EP-mediated DNA delivery","vaccine immunogenicity","EP delivery","electroporation-mediated vaccine delivery","breakthrough technology capable of mediating efficient DNA uptake","vaccine field","infectious diseases","cancer immunotherapy","antigen design","enhanced antigen expression","curing diseases","cancer therapy","humans","context of clinical trials","unexpected poor immunogenicity","immune tolerance","immense progress","unique advantages","strong immune responses","competitive immunization approach","plasmid optimization","scalability","viral infection","challenges","possibility of repeated administrations","preclinical studies","antigenic diversity","safety","important benefits","investigational medications","wide array of conditions","simplicity","addition","potential","exciting efficacy","immunologic adjuvants","major platforms","products","chapter","endeavors","tremendous efforts","obstacle","strategies"],"language":"en"},

Large proportions are the result of virus infections. A commonly cited example of resurgent or recurrent disease is the yearly appearance of new antigenically different influenza viruses. These new variants are able to evoke disease in their host while causing the centuries-old symptoms of influenza. However, conventional virological techniques have failed to identify the agent, even though evidence suggested non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) is caused by a blood-borne, small enveloped virus, readily transmissible to chimpanzees. Modern molecular biology techniques are used to identify completely new viruses. These viruses can be associated with a new disease or associated with a well-characterized disease present in humans for many years. In identifying an emerging virus, one is often presented with epidemiological data and clinical specimens that have no reactivity with diagnostic reagents available for known pathogens. The primary aim therefore is to identify any new infectious agent and build a body of data to support the existence of a causal link between organism and disease.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kellam, Paul","journal":"HIV and the New Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155652/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjszNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new disease","new viruses","recurrent disease","new variants","new infectious agent","yearly appearance of new","well-characterized disease present","result of virus infections","different influenza viruses","emerging virus","small enveloped virus","microbial infections","body of data","epidemiological data","non-B hepatitis","conventional virological techniques","centuries-old symptoms of influenza","Modern molecular biology techniques","reactivity","diagnostic reagents available","existence","humans","known pathogens","clinical specimens","cited example of resurgent","NANBH","blood","human evolution","host","causal link","organism","evidence","Large proportions","chimpanzees","Diseases","years","primary aim"],"language":"en"},

Among the viruses, those with RNA genomes tend to play a more prominent role, particularly among immunologically intact individuals. DNA viruses are also associated with respiratory disease. The characteristics of the viruses most often associated with respiratory disease are described briefly in the chapter. Three distinct types of influenza viruses are recognized, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and influenza C virus, based on antigenic differences in the nucleoprotein and matrix proteins. All three viruses share certain characteristics, including the presence of a viral envelope containing glycoproteins important for viral entry and egress from cells, and a segmented genome. The standard nomenclature for influenza viruses includes the influenza type, place of initial isolation, strain designation, and year of isolation.","publish_time":"2007-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Treanor, John; Fleming, Douglas","journal":"Practical Guidelines in Antiviral Therapy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza type","influenza C virus","influenza B virus","distinct types of influenza viruses","DNA viruses","viral entry","viral envelope","viral pneumonia","wide variety of viral","non-viral agents","Acute respiratory disease","year of isolation","certain characteristics","place of initial isolation","glycoproteins important","strain designation","egress","antigenic differences","cells","illness","presence","croup","nucleoprotein","bronchiolitis","matrix proteins","standard nomenclature","prominent role","intact individuals","segmented genome","RNA genomes","chapter"],"language":"en"},

The markets in the developed world are now relatively mature and will show little growth for new products in the future. Growth in the developed world is concentrated on the replacement market, which represents over one-third of the total valve market. New sales growth is now concentrated in developing regions such as China, India, and South America. The majority of investment in oil exploration and development will take place in the developing countries in the Middle East, Africa, Central and South America, and South and East Asia. Chemical processing would continue to move its manufacturing to these areas with large populations and growing living standards. These improved living standards would also lead to investment in infrastructure such as extension of piped water supplies and wastewater treatment services and power generation. The major driving force in Europe is the increasing impact of the EU directives upon national legislation in subjects as diverse as water treatment and pressure system design. The major valve application in the Middle East is in the oil and petrochemical industries with the region producing nearly 30% of the world\u0027s oil, with an increasing requirement for water treatment such as desalination plants. Most of the valve sales to the region are made through large plant contractors and oil companies.","publish_time":"2007-09-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weaver, Graham","journal":"Profile of the International Valve Industry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155725/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs0MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chemical","EU"],"locations":["China","India","South America","South","Middle East","Africa","East Asia","Europe"],"keyphrases":["total valve market","valve sales","Middle East","South America","international industrial valve market","oil exploration","oil companies","replacement market","world\u0027s oil","major valve application","New sales growth","market size estimates","East Asia","little growth","developed world","wastewater treatment services","growing living standards","improved living standards","extension of piped water supplies","increasing impact","large populations","increasing requirement","developing countries","developing regions","majority of investment","new products","large plant contractors","major driving force","subjects","national legislation","EU directives","Africa","Europe","areas","China","India","overview","development","pressure system design","power generation","manufacturing","year","infrastructure","desalination plants","petrochemical industries","future","chapter","markets","Chemical processing","forecasts"],"language":"en"},

Two clones, Caco\u20102/CA1 and Caco\u20102/CA2, were then isolated by monitoring alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cell proliferation activities. The ALP activity level of CA1 cells was significantly higher than that of CA2 cells, while the level of cell proliferation activity of CA1 was significantly lower than that of CA2. When CA1 and CA2 cells were infected with BCV at confluence, virus hemagglutination (HA) was detected in the culture supernatant at 5 days postinfection for CA1 cells and at 8 days postinfection for CA2 cells. Thus, BCV propagation was substantially delayed in CA2 cells, suggesting that a cellular factor(s) that appears at the differentiation stage may control BCV propagation.

If the trend continues, it is probable that some will escape cultivation and become invasive in native ecosystems.

Predictive models derived from discriminant analysis correctly classified 86.2% of the species in cross\u2010validation, whereas those derived from classification and regression trees classified 76% correctly. From these models we created a hierarchical predictive tree that allows the user to divide species into three categories: admit (low risk of invasiveness), deny admission (high risk of invasiveness), or delay admission for further analyses and/or monitor intensively (risk cannot adequately be assessed based on only the included attributes). We recommend that species that are highly invasive elsewhere not be allowed into the U.S. and that a more conservative introduction policy using a hierarchical predictive method be employed.","publish_time":"2002-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reichard, Sarah Hayden; Hamilton, Clement W.","journal":"Conserv Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9661fef183621d161ba2568febef7b448ff43203.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162396/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs3OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America","U.S."],"keyphrases":["Plant species","Predictive models","North America","hierarchical predictive method","hierarchical predictive tree","high risk of invasiveness","low risk of invasiveness","delay admission","retrospective analysis","discriminant analysis","included attributes","biogeographical attributes of woody plants","life history","user","conservative introduction policy","cultivation","categories","classification","native ecosystems","validation","various purposes","traits","regression trees","analyses","cross","trend"],"language":"en"},

Therein, we learn that the race to discover the outbreak\u0027s aetiology was tainted by scientific malpractice; that an esteemed Chinese microbiologist, Dr. Hong, apparently promoted his own, patently false, aetiological discovery, stifled debate on the matter and, in doing so, held the international response to the outbreak back by a number of weeks. But how was this account rhetorically constructed? And how did it engage with Dr. Hong\u0027s own research work? Findings \u2013 Does Hong deserve to be remembered as an inept scientist? Subsequent accounts have been quick to repeat this one, founding text\u0027s account, suggesting that \u2018yes, he does\u2019. This chapter, however, returns to the primary data, examines the ways in which the original account troped those data and moves to suggest that \u2018no, he does not\u2019. Contributions to the field \u2013 Teasing out the more general implications of this particular case study, the chapter concludes with a discussion of the analytical gains that might accrue if other popular scientific histories of emerging epidemics were approached as \u2018topics\u2019 rather than \u2018resources\u2019.","publish_time":"2010-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Attenborough, Frederick","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24cc817d27e43b9e7bdc5537872088710ea2a566.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162427.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162427/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chapter","ways","influential account","primary data","original account","text\u0027s account","popular scientific histories of emerging epidemics","primary historical data","understanding","generations of popular science histories of emerging epidemics","scientific malpractice","severe acute respiratory syndrome","stifled debate","SARS","particular case study","esteemed Chinese microbiologist","aetiological discovery","general implications","outbreak\u0027s aetiology","rhetorical analysis","matter","transformations impact","discussion","topics\u2019","analytical gains","Subsequent accounts","Hong\u0027s","research work","field","ability","race","international response","number of weeks","Purpose","aims","inept scientist","Contributions","resources\u2019","Findings","Approach","does\u2019"],"language":"en"},

Yet the goals of high native species diversity and weed management are difficult to achieve in grassland restoration projects. To increase our understanding of whether synergies exist between these goals (i.e. whether early introduction of a larger number of species might improve both outcomes in the reassembly of native grassland), we examined the relationships between plant species number, functional group number and resource use during the establishment phase of direct\u2010sown grassland. We did this by sowing a representative suite of species (at varying levels of species number and functional group number) into experimental plots and then measuring and analysing the extent to which the newly established assemblages captured available resources, i.e. used soil nitrate, absorbed light and produced biomass (vegetative cover). Statistically significant correlations were common between the predictor variables (species number, functional group number, percentage vegetative cover, plant number, presence of idiosyncratic (dominating) species) and responses (soil nitrate concentration, light reduction or \u2018extinction\u2019). Higher diversity was associated with lower soil nitrate, while percentage vegetative cover and the presence of idiosyncratic species best predicted light extinction. The relationship between diversity, and plant biomass (measured as vegetative cover) and plant number was positive in the first year of the study. The diversity/biomass relationship became negative in the second year due to the higher numbers and cover of \u2018idiosyncratic\u2019 species. The diversity/plant number relationship also became negative in the autumn of the second year and was reduced to a trend by the winter. We found that lower nitrate and increasing plant numbers and vegetative cover were most strongly linked to increasing species number in the early stages of this study. This suggests that introducing and maintaining high diversity early in a native grassland reassembly or enhancement project will improve the resistance (e.g. to weed) of these communities. At later stages of grassland development, this function may be provided by the more dominating idiosyncratic species. The maintenance of diversity, an important goal in its own right, will therefore necessitate managed disturbances to periodically reduce the vegetative dominance of idiosyncratic species, releasing resources for the diverse range of other species whose early introduction will have allowed them to persist in the soil seed bank or as suppressed rootstocks.","publish_time":"2009-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibson\u2010Roy, By Paul; Delpratt, John; Moore, Greg; Hepworth, Graham","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4af1a8cf58ae605412a9401b81adb96859730ff4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163525.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["plant species number","larger number of species","plant number relationship","presence of idiosyncratic species","dominating idiosyncratic species","varying levels of species number","vegetative dominance of idiosyncratic species","goals of high native species diversity","functional group number","representative suite of species","plant biomass","high diversity","Higher diversity","percentage vegetative cover","plant numbers","maintenance of diversity","lower soil nitrate","threatened plant communities","soil nitrate concentration","lower nitrate","sown grassland","biomass relationship","early stages","early introduction","year","grassland restoration projects","later stages of grassland development","light reduction","soil seed bank","predicted light extinction","produced biomass","higher numbers","study","temperate native grasslands of south\u2010eastern Australia","available resources","diverse range","weed management","resource use","predictor variables","establishment phase of direct","responses","relationships","successful conservation","right","established assemblages","suppressed rootstocks","important goal","decline","enhancement project","experimental plots","outcomes","significant correlations","managed disturbances","Summary","autumn","extent","resistance","synergies","trend","understanding","winter"],"language":"en"},

The habitat requirements of a species are the resources, conditions and space required for survival and reproduction. The habitat requirements of butterflies have been well studied, but the extent to which individuals within a species and between species utilise and share the habitat is poorly known. 2. In a butterfly assemblage in northern Italy, we found that adults from 30 species avoid deciduous high\u2010density forests and their ecotones, and they were positively related to open areas and their ecotones. Besides these common features, five groups of species can be discriminated in relation to a gradient from open area to forest, and species within groups were not equally specialised, as observed from a bipartite network analysis. In particular, some species appeared to be specialised and others appeared to be generalist, suggesting a nested pattern of resource use, rather than a clustered pattern in which each species uses a different subset of habitat types. 3. The degree of variation in specialisation among species varied with the number of species falling in each group. Thus, an increased number of species, and thus possibly competition, is more likely to promote the co\u2010occurrence of generalist and specialised species (nested patterns) rather than an increased niche segregation among species. 4. Ascertaining how species overlap their habitat use at a local scale can be relevant for conservation purposes, because specialised populations are potentially more susceptible to network distortions.","publish_time":"2016-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trivellini, Guido; Polidori, Carlo; Pasquaretta, Cristian; Orsenigo, Simone; Bogliani, Giuseppe","journal":"Insect Conserv Divers","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9870a109f5f4a49fb1144253ddbd9881d2bf4529.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165506.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165506/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE5LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":661339,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:32Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RDV2QzKsOFXhZitgGx6gbw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_19.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specialised species","groups of species","increased number of species","habitat use","habitat requirements of butterflies","specialised populations","different subset of habitat types","ecotones","nested pattern of resource use","nested patterns","co\u2010occurrence of generalist","clustered pattern","open areas","network distortions","increased niche segregation","bipartite network analysis","conservation purposes","local scale","adults","deciduous high\u2010density forests","space","northern Italy","conditions","relation","specialisation","resources","survival","butterfly assemblage","gradient","degree of variation","common features","individuals","reproduction","competition","extent"],"language":"en"},

The change from pasture to forest occurs about six to ten years after planting. The last forest birds come in about 20 years after planting. 3. Birds have an important role in establishing the shrub layer and mixing some tree\u2010species into the plantation, by dissemination. 4.

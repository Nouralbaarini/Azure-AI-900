METHODS: An observational cohort of hospitalized and outpatient participants with ILI was conducted in six hospitals in Mexico. Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for influenza and other common respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: A total of 4778 participants were enrolled in this study and had complete data. A total of 2053 (43.0%) had severe ILI. Seven hundred and seventy\u2010eight (16.3%) were positive for influenza, 2636 (55.2%) were positive for other viral respiratory pathogens, and 1364 (28.5%) had no respiratory virus isolated. Adults with influenza were more likely to be hospitalized if they were underweight (OR: 5.20), obese (OR: 3.18), or morbidly obese (OR: 18.40) compared to normal\u2010weight adults. Obese adults with H1N1 had a sixfold increase in odds of hospitalization over H3N2 and B (obese OR: 8.96 vs 1.35, morbidly obese OR: 35.13 vs 5.58, respectively) compared to normal\u2010weight adults.

HYPOTHESIS: Feline EUC is a clinically defined disease entity, which differs from feline hippocampal necrosis by the absence of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal alteration of the hippocampus. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the prevalence of EUC in a hospital population of cats by applying well\u2010defined inclusion criteria, and (2) to describe the clinical course of EUC. ANIMALS: Eighty\u2010one cats with recurrent seizures. METHODS: Retrospective study\u2014medical records were reviewed for cats presented for evaluation of recurrent seizures (2005\u20132010). Inclusion criteria were a defined diagnosis based on laboratory data, and either MRI or histopathology. Final outcome was confirmed by telephone interview with the owner. Magnetic resonance images were reviewed to evaluate hippocampal morphology and signal alterations. RESULTS: Epilepsy of unknown cause was diagnosed in 22% of cats with epilepsy. Physical, neurologic, and laboratory examinations, and either 1.5 T MRI and cerebrospinal fluid analysis or postmortem examination failed to identify an underlying cause. Cats with EUC had a higher survival rate (P \u003C .05) and seizure remission occurred frequently (44.4%). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A detailed clinical evaluation and diagnostic imaging with MRI is recommended in any cat with recurrent seizures. The prognosis of cats with normal MRI findings and a clinical diagnosis of EUC are good. Standardized imaging guidelines should be established to assess the hippocampus in cats.","publish_time":"2013-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wahle, A.M.; Br\u00FChschwein, A.; Matiasek, K.; Putschbach, K.; Wagner, E.; Mueller, R.S.; Fischer, A.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b63e072c4c58506623101d89b72d4c71206ceb31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4895554.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.12250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24237601/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs3MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Feline EUC"],"organizations":["EUC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Feline EUC","clinical diagnosis of EUC","prevalence of EUC","clinical course of EUC","prognosis of cats","T MRI","hospital population of cats","evaluation of recurrent seizures","diagnosis of feline epilepsy of unknown cause","detailed clinical evaluation","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","defined diagnosis","diagnostic imaging","normal MRI findings","feline hippocampal necrosis","absence of magnetic resonance imaging","thorough diagnostic evaluation","underlying cause","hippocampus","Magnetic resonance images","well\u2010defined inclusion criteria","Standardized imaging guidelines","hippocampal morphology","laboratory examinations","laboratory data","signal alterations","Retrospective study","defined disease entity","postmortem examination","cerebrospinal fluid analysis","medical records","higher survival rate","telephone interview","METHODS","Final outcome","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","ANIMALS","seizure remission","owner","histopathology","HYPOTHESIS","objectives"],"language":"en"},

We analysed 304 serum samples from Tanzanian dogs for the detection of rabies antibodies in a pseudotype assay using lentiviral vectors bearing the CVS-11 envelope glycoprotein. Compared with the widely used gold standard fluorescent antibody virus neutralisation assay, a specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 94.4% with a strong correlation of antibody titres (r =0.915) were observed with the pseudotype assay.

Significant activity against leukemia in mice was demonstrated for extracts of Cephalotaxus. Cephalotaxine (CET) (1), the major alkaloid of this series was isolated from Cephalotaxus drupacea species by Paudler in 1963. The subsequent discovery of promising antitumor activity among new Cephalotaxus derivatives reported by Chinese, Japanese, and American teams triggered extensive structure elucidation and biological studies in this family. The structural feature of this cephalotaxane family relies mainly on its tetracyclic alkaloid backbone, which comprises an azaspiranic 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane unit (rings C and D) and a benzazepine ring system (rings A and B), which is linked by its C3 alcohol function to a chiral oxygenated side chain by a carboxylic function alpha to a tetrasubstituted carbon center. The botanical distribution of these alkaloids is limited to the Cephalotaxus genus (Cephalotaxaceae). The scope of biological activities of the Cephalotaxus alkaloids is mainly centered on the antileukemic activity of homoharringtonine (HHT) (2), which in particular demonstrated marked benefits in the treatment of orphan myeloid leukemia and was approved as soon as 2009 by European Medicine Agency and by US Food and Drug Administration in 2012. Its exact mechanism of action was partly elucidated and it was early recognized that HHT (2) inhibited protein synthesis at the level of the ribosome machinery. Interestingly, after a latency period of two decades, the topic of Cephalotaxus alkaloids reemerged as a prolific source of new natural structures. To date, more than 70 compounds have been identified and characterized. Synthetic studies also regained attention during the past two decades, and numerous methodologies were developed to access the first semisynthetic HHT (2) of high purity suitable for clinical studies, and then high grade enantiomerically pure CET (1), HHT (2), and analogs.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E9rard-Viret, Jo\u00EBlle; Quteishat, Laith; Alsalim, Rana; Royer, Jacques; Dumas, Fran\u00E7oise","journal":"The Alkaloids: Chemistry and Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/374504f9a761e35a31fadeb37cee82e2d02eca22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110560.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.alkal.2017.07.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1099483117300160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28838429/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1099483117300160","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cephalotaxine"],"organizations":["European Medicine Agency","US Food and Drug Administration"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["topic of Cephalotaxus alkaloids","Abstract Cephalotaxus alkaloids","extracts of Cephalotaxus","Cephalotaxus genus","new Cephalotaxus derivatives","Cephalotaxus drupacea species","biological studies","semisynthetic HHT","clinical studies","cephalotaxane family","decades","Synthetic studies","Significant activity","antileukemic activity of homoharringtonine","high grade","family of plant secondary metabolites","rings C","pure CET","major alkaloid","subsequent discovery of promising antitumor activity","carboxylic function alpha","C3 alcohol function","high purity suitable","scope of biological activities","tetracyclic alkaloid backbone","treatment of orphan myeloid leukemia","particular demonstrated marked benefits","prolific source of new natural structures","extensive structure elucidation","American teams","US Food","chain","Japanese","Chinese","nonane unit","benzazepine ring system","series","mice","tetrasubstituted carbon center","European Medicine Agency","level","attention","Drug Administration","protein synthesis","azaspiro","years","azaspiranic","numerous methodologies","structural feature","Paudler","ribosome machinery","latency period","exact mechanism of action","botanical distribution","Cephalotaxaceae","date","compounds","Cephalotaxine","analogs"],"language":"en"},

Here, we propose a method that relies on virus culturing combined with state-of-the-art sequencing techniques. The most natural ex vivo culture system was used to enable replication of respiratory viruses. METHOD: Three respiratory clinical samples were tested on well-differentiated pseudostratified tracheobronchial human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures grown at an air\u2013liquid interface, which resemble the airway epithelium. Cells were stained with convalescent serum of the patients to identify infected cells and apical washes were analyzed by VIDISCA-454, a next-generation sequencing virus discovery technique. RESULTS: Infected cells were observed for all three samples. Sequencing subsequently indicated that the cells were infected by either human coronavirus OC43, influenzavirus B, or influenzavirus A. The sequence reads covered a large part of the genome (52%, 82%, and 57%, respectively). CONCLUSION: We present here a new method for virus discovery that requires a virus culture on primary cells and an antibody detection. The virus in the harvest can be used to characterize the viral genome sequence and cell tropism, but also provides progeny virus to initiate experiments to fulfill the Koch\u0027s postulates.","publish_time":"2014-12-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jazaeri Farsani, Seyed Mohammad; Deijs, Martin; Dijkman, Ronald; Molenkamp, Richard; Jeeninga, Rienk E; Ieven, Margareta; Goossens, Herman; van der Hoek, Lia","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ae32ac7470a95f95ccd2309bfb62a990c1e0e16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4280819.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25482367/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["A.

Disturbance of a balanced nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiome might be involved in the onset of symptomatic infections with these pathogens, which occurs primarily in fall and winter. It is unknown whether seasonal infection patterns are associated with concomitant changes in NP microbiota. As young children are generally prone to respiratory and invasive infections, we characterized the NP microbiota of 96 healthy children by barcoded pyrosequencing of the V5\u2013V6 hypervariable region of the 16S-rRNA gene, and compared microbiota composition between children sampled in winter/fall with children sampled in spring. The approximately 1000000 sequences generated represented 13 taxonomic phyla and approximately 250 species-level phyla types (OTUs). The 5 most predominant phyla were Proteobacteria (64%), Firmicutes (21%), Bacteroidetes (11%), Actinobacteria (3%) and Fusobacteria (1,4%) with Moraxella, Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Flavobacteria, Dolosigranulum, Corynebacterium and Neisseria as predominant genera. The inter-individual variability was that high that on OTU level a core microbiome could not be defined. Microbiota profiles varied strongly with season, with in fall/winter a predominance of Proteobacteria (relative abundance (% of all sequences): 75% versus 51% in spring) and Fusobacteria (absolute abundance (% of children): 14% versus 2% in spring), and in spring a predominance of Bacteroidetes (relative abundance: 19% versus 3% in fall/winter, absolute abundance: 91% versus 54% in fall/winter), and Firmicutes. The latter increase is mainly due to (Brevi)bacillus and Lactobacillus species (absolute abundance: 96% versus 10% in fall/winter) which are like Bacteroidetes species generally related to healthy ecosystems. The observed seasonal effects could not be attributed to recent antibiotics or viral co-infection. The NP microbiota of young children is highly diverse and appears different between seasons. These differences seem independent of antibiotic use or viral co-infection.","publish_time":"2011-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bogaert, Debby; Keijser, Bart; Huse, Susan; Rossen, John; Veenhoven, Reinier; van Gils, Elske; Bruin, Jacob; Montijn, Roy; Bonten, Marc; Sanders, Elisabeth","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bafbd40e253b24fc6b10b66bf68fe838e0a6a313.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3046172.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21386965/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0017035","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["winter","fall","NP microbiota of young children","healthy children","absolute abundance","spring","relative abundance","Bacteroidetes species","microbiota composition","Microbiota profiles","predominance of Bacteroidetes","predominant phyla","viral co-infection","species-level phyla types","invasive pathogens","Lactobacillus species","invasive infections","seasonal infection patterns","predominance of Proteobacteria","taxonomic phyla","Fusobacteria","sequences","Firmicutes","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Haemophilus influenzae","OTU level","Neisseria meningitidis","core microbiome","healthy ecosystems","predominant genera","onset of symptomatic infections","observed seasonal effects","V5","Corynebacterium","Flavobacteria","Dolosigranulum","barcoded pyrosequencing","independent of antibiotic use","commensal bacteria","V6 hypervariable region","concomitant changes","S-rRNA gene","recent antibiotics","ecological niche","Brevi","Moraxella","OTUs","inter-individual variability","differences","Disturbance","nasopharynx","seasons","Actinobacteria","increase"],"language":"en"},

Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SARS but the significance remains undetermined. Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and virologic features of the intestinal involvement of this new viral infection. Methods : A retrospective analysis of the gastrointestinal symptoms and other clinical parameters of the first 138 patients with confirmed SARS admitted for a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003 was performed. Intestinal specimens were obtained by colonoscopy or postmortem examination to detect the presence of coronavirus by electron microscopy, virus culture, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results : Among these 138 patients with SARS, 28 (20.3%) presented with watery diarrhea and up to 38.4% of patients had symptoms of diarrhea during the course of illness. Diarrhea was more frequently observed during the first week of illness. The mean number of days with diarrhea was 3.7 \u00B1 2.7, and most diarrhea was self-limiting. Intestinal biopsy specimens obtained by colonoscopy or autopsy showed minimal architectural disruption but the presence of active viral replication within both the small and large intestine. Coronavirus was also isolated by culture from these specimens, and SARS-CoV RNA can be detected in the stool of patients for more than 10 weeks after symptom onset. Conclusions : Diarrhea is a common presenting symptom of SARS. The intestinal tropism of the SARS-CoV has major implications on clinical presentation and viral transmission.","publish_time":"2003-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, Wai K; To, Ka-fai; Chan, Paul K.S; Chan, Henry L.Y; Wu, Alan K.L; Lee, Nelson; Yuen, Kwok Y; Sung, Joseph J.Y","journal":"Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61646443e2692515c3e0a1788da25d6789462c9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126982.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508503012150; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016508503012150","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["symptoms of diarrhea","confirmed SARS","SARS-CoV RNA","Intestinal specimens","watery diarrhea","stool of patients","common presenting symptom of SARS","Intestinal biopsy specimens","gastrointestinal symptoms","presence of coronavirus","intestinal involvement","intestinal tropism","colonoscopy","clinical presentation","viral transmission","new viral infection","clinical parameters","novel coronavirus","presence of active viral replication","major implications","virus culture","major outbreak","respiratory complications","emerged infection","symptom onset","course of illness","week of illness","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","minimal architectural disruption","autopsy","electron microscopy","reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","virologic features","retrospective analysis","postmortem examination","fever","Abstract Background","Hong Kong","mean number of days","Conclusions","weeks","significance","large intestine","Methods","Results"],"language":"en"},

While the pharmaceutical industry views emerging economies as potential new markets, most of the world\u2019s poorest bottom billion now reside in middle-income countries--a fact that has complicated tiered access arrangements.

The case fatality rate may be as high as 3.4% and, although the indications are that it is a mild, self-limiting illness for the majority of those infected, it clearly has the potential to cause significant disruption globally. Many countries are moving from the \u2018containment\u2019 to the \u2018delay\u2019 phase in controlling the outbreak with a recent UK model suggesting a potential peak in June 2020 (Danon et al., 2020). Occupational hygienists have particular skills in understanding exposure to hazards in the workplace and a long history of introducing simple and effective measures that reduce risk to workers\u2019 health. These skills may be able to contribute to protecting the global workforce from Covid-19. Workers involved in healthcare have always had a recognized increase in risk of developing infections present in the community where their patients are drawn. Health care workers are often on the front line dealing with those who are ill and at the most infectious period of a disease, as in the cases of SARS, MERS, and Ebola. Healthcare facilities can therefore act as a focus for infection spreading, giving rise to disease clusters linked to hospitals, social care facilities, and other health locations (Rajakaruna et al., 2017). In the SARS and MERS outbreaks between 2003 and 2015, between 44 and 100% of cases were linked to healthcare settings and healthcare workers made up around a quarter of those infected (Chowell et al., 2015). Other workers involved in providing services to the public may also be at increased risk during particular outbreaks where transmission is through face-to-face or close contact. A recent analysis in the USA has estimated that 10% of the workforce are employed in roles where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week (Baker et al., 2020). Beyond caring and protective service workers, there are a wide range of service-economy workers who may be at risk from a respiratory infection like Covid-19. Shop workers, bus drivers, cleaners, teachers, bank workers and hospitality staff are among the many service-sector employees who will have frequent and close interaction with many people over the course of a shift. Many of these workers will either have physical contact with the public or indirect contact through exchange of money or goods\u2014an exposure route for transmission that is poorly understood (Angelakis et al., 2014). There are also complex societal issues around workers who are ill but feel that they have to work for economic or other reasons, and thereby increase the risks for colleagues and the public.[truncated]","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Semple, Sean; Cherrie, John W","journal":"Ann Work Expo Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a1ef8f2cf2de3416e61f38110c1642158207c08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184324.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32202635/; https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxaa033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","Healthcare","SARS","USA"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["healthcare workers","bank workers","economy workers","Shop workers","Health care workers","protective service workers","public","Healthcare facilities","Covid","increased risk","close contact","disease clusters","Coronavirus Disease","healthcare settings","cases of SARS","transmission","understanding exposure","indirect contact","risk of developing infections","exposure route","particular skills","particular outbreaks","physical contact","workers\u2019 health","health locations","respiratory infection","MERS outbreaks","countries","wide range of service","social care facilities","service-sector employees","potential peak","close interaction","recognized increase","recent analysis","global workforce","recent UK model","teachers","cleaners","effective measures","hazards","hospitals","goods","bus drivers","exchange of money","long history","people","workplace","rise","hospitality staff","Occupational hygienists","majority","quarter","roles","complex societal issues","self-limiting illness","case fatality rate","delay","course","community","risks","colleagues","focus","infectious period","reasons","phase","shift","containment","USA","significant disruption","Chowell","Danon","week","Rajakaruna","Ebola","line","services","time of writing","Baker","patients","indications","Angelakis","world","China"],"language":"en"},

Early estimates of the epidemic growth and incubation period of COVID-19 may have been biased due to sample selection. Using detailed case reports from 14 locations in and outside mainland China, we obtained 378 Wuhan-exported cases who left Wuhan before an abrupt travel quarantine. We developed a generative model we call BETS for four key epidemiological events---Beginning of exposure, End of exposure, time of Transmission, and time of Symptom onset (BETS)---and derived explicit formulas to correct for the sample selection. We gave a detailed illustration of why some early and highly influential analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic were severely biased. All our analyses, regardless of which subsample and model were being used, point to an epidemic doubling time of 2 to 2.5 days during the early outbreak in Wuhan. A Bayesian nonparametric analysis further suggests that about 5% of the symptomatic cases may not develop symptoms within 14 days of infection and that men may be much more likely than women to develop symptoms within 2 days of infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Qingyuan; Ju, Nianqiao; Bacallado, Sergio; Shah, Rajen D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c2c4e3d9f0cec51a82cdcd8cadf878b22039e6e4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07743v3.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Wuhan","days of infection","early outbreak","time of Transmission","BETS","epidemic doubling time","symptoms","Early estimates","sample selection","time of Symptom onset","incubation period of COVID","epidemic growth","End of exposure","global pandemic","regional outbreak","detailed illustration","symptomatic cases","influential analyses","generative model","outside mainland China","detailed case reports","locations","key epidemiological events","derived explicit formulas","abrupt travel quarantine","women","Bayesian nonparametric analysis","coronavirus disease"],"language":"en"},

In this article our goal is to study the missing peak, i.e. the currently infected one (or total currently positive). After the April 7 the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked. So we decided to generalize the model, introducing new parameters. Moreover, we adopt a similar approach used in [1] (for the estimation of deaths) in order to evaluate the recoveries. In this way, introducing a simple conservation law, we define a model with 4 populations: total infected, currently positives, recoveries and deaths. Therefore, we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the method is general and thus applicable to other diseases. Finally we study the behavior of the ratio infected over swabs for Italy, Germany and USA, and we show as studying this parameter we recover the generalized Logistic model used in [1] for these three countries. We think that this trend could be useful for a future epidemic of this coronavirus.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martelloni, Gabriele; Martelloni, Gianluca","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30441224be07bd9dac537de57727a44690869df6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03455v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIRD"],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["infected curve","generalized Logistic model","classical SIRD model","Italy","Sars- Cov","Sars-Cov","recoveries","estimation of deaths","generalized logistic equation","number of swabs","logistical behavior","alternative method","future epidemic","previous article","evaluation","peaks","positives","populations","simple conservation law","way","goal","large increase","temporal evolution","Germany","USA","missing peak","order","ratio","diseases","trend","time window","coronavirus","new parameters","similar approach","countries"],"language":"en"},

There is also intense debate about policies for limiting the damage, both to health and to the economy. On the one hand, the health and safety of the population is the principal consideration for most countries. On the other hand, we cannot ignore the potential for long-term economic damage caused by strict nation-wide lockdowns. In this working paper, we present a quantitative way to compute lockdown decisions for individual cities or regions, while balancing health and economic considerations. Furthermore, these policies are learnt automatically by the proposed algorithm, as a function of disease parameters (infectiousness, gestation period, duration of symptoms, probability of death) and population characteristics (density, movement propensity). We account for realistic considerations such as imperfect lockdowns, and show that the policy obtained using reinforcement learning is a viable quantitative approach towards lockdowns.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khadilkar, Harshad; Ganu, Tanuja; Seetharam, Deva P","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/15c7e413de2e615378e1c0d4fa23d1f3425af285.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14093v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["balancing health","economic considerations","imperfect lockdowns","policies","hand","long-term economic damage","strict nation-wide lockdowns","population characteristics","quantitative way","realistic considerations","viable quantitative approach","function of disease parameters","regions","gestation period","individual cities","infectiousness","probability of death","lockdown decisions","duration of symptoms","reinforcement learning","density","pandemic","movement propensity","potential","safety","ongoing Covid","principal consideration","reports","proposed algorithm","policy","working paper","intense debate","context","studies","countries","spread","economy"],"language":"en"},

A major result indicates an existing infections estimate at about 10-50 times the daily confirmed new cases, with the stringent social distancing policy tipping to the upper end of this range. It clarifies the relationship between the infection rate and the test rate to put the epidemic under control, which says that the test rate shall keep up at the same pace as infection rate to prevent an outbreak. This relationship is meaningful in the wake of business re-opening in the U.S. and the world. The report also reveals the connections of all the measures taken to the epidemic spread. A stratified sampling method is proposed to add to the current tool kits of epidemic control.

The statistical analysis here focuses on case study of Italy, one of the countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Results reveal two main findings: 1) cities in regions with high wind speed and a high wind energy production in MW have a lower number of infected individuals of COVID-19 infection and total deaths; 2) cities located in hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with high polluting industrialization, low wind speed and less cleaner production have a greater number of infected individuals and total deaths. Hence, cities with pollution industrialization and low renewable energy have also to consider low wind speed and other climatological factors that can increase stagnation of the air in the atmosphere with potential problems for public health in the presence of viral agents. Results here suggest that current pandemic of Coronavirus disease and future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection cannot be solved only with research and practice of medicine, immunology and microbiology but also with a proactive strategy directed to interventions for a sustainable development. Overall, then, this study has to conclude that a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection must also be based on sustainability science to support a higher level of renewable energy and cleaner production to reduce polluting industrialization and, as result, the factors determining the spread of coronavirus disease and other infections in society.","publish_time":"2020-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coccia, Mario","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ec52225d0a95e25baa10131cbd20d3a0eb4e187.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08293v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high wind energy production","high wind speed","low wind speed","wind resources","low renewable energy","cities","high polluting industrialization","future epidemics similar","cleaner production","pollution industrialization","diffusion of COVID","total deaths","lower number of infected individuals of COVID","higher level of renewable energy","air pollution","study endeavors","Results","greater number of infected individuals","spread of coronavirus disease","case study of Italy","current pandemic of Coronavirus disease","climatological factors","proactive strategy","rapid increase","sustainable development","insights of sustainable policy","particulate compounds emissions","MW","public health","atmosphere","relation","large urban conurbations","potential problems","microbiology","regions","practice of medicine","immunology","presence of viral agents","research","interventions","infections","stagnation","confirmed cases","sustainability science","hinterland zones","main findings","countries","statistical analysis","society"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we focus on developing some potential use-cases of intelligent speech analysis for COVID-19 diagnosed patients. In particular, by analysing speech recordings from these patients, we construct audio-only-based models to automatically categorise the health state of patients from four aspects, including the severity of illness, sleep quality, fatigue, and anxiety. For this purpose, two established acoustic feature sets and support vector machines are utilised. Our experiments show that an average accuracy of .69 obtained estimating the severity of illness, which is derived from the number of days in hospitalisation.

It enables the identification of the key quantities required to form adequate policies for control and mitigation in terms of observable parameters using the Landau-Stuart equation. It is intended to be complementary to detailed simulations and methods published recently by Ferguson and collaborators, March 16, (2020). The results suggest that the initial growth/spreading rate gamma-c of the disease, and the fraction of infected persons in the population p-i can be used to define a \u0060retardation/inhibition coefficient\u0027 k-star , which is a measure of the effectiveness of the control policies adopted. The results are obtained analytically and numerically using a simple Python code. The solutions provide both qualitative and quantitative information. They substantiate and justify two basic control policies enunciated by WHO and adopted in many countries: a) Systematic and early intensive testing individuals for covid-19 and b) Sequestration policies such as \u0060social/physical distancing\u0027 and population density reduction by strict quarantining are essential for making k-star greater than 1, necessary for suppressing the pandemic. The model indicates that relaxing such measures when the infection rate starts to decrease as a result of earlier policies could simply restart the infection rate in the non-infected population. Presently available available statistical data in WHO and other reports can be readily used to determine the the key parameters of the model. Possible extensions to the basic model to make it more realistic are indicated.","publish_time":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thyagaraja, Anantanarayanan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4dd17be301f6fdb1616e3ea082c8c54928b5a3e6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12781v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs1ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ferguson"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["basic control policies","adequate policies","Sequestration policies","basic model","infection rate","given population","phenomenological model","non-infected population","result of earlier policies","population density reduction","covid","population p-i","key parameters","Pandemic","results","rate gamma-c","available available statistical data","key quantities","star greater","terms of observable parameters","fraction of infected persons","mitigation","early intensive testing individuals","physical distancing","strict quarantining","disease","initial growth","Corona Virus","methods","Landau-Stuart equation","simulations","Ferguson","solutions","quantitative information","inhibition coefficient","Possible extensions","effectiveness","measures","simple Python code","retardation","collaborators","reports","countries","identification"],"language":"en"},

In this backdrop, there is wide interest in looking for ways to support multiple patients from a single ventilator. Various solutions, based upon simple mechanical division of the ventilator tubings are described. However, recently warnings have been issued by multiple international professional societies against these plumbing solutions as it can seriously harm the patients. Methods: We have bifurcated the inspiratory and expiratory conduits from a single ventilator with addition of one way valves, pressure and flow sensors along with volume and PEEP control. A purpose-built software and a low-cost microcontroller based control system integrates and displays the data in the familiar ventilatory graphic and numerical format onto a generic screen. The system is calibrated with simulated lungs with varying compliance. In addition to the standard microbial, heat and moisture exchanger filters we design to add UV-C lights at 254-260 nanometre wavelength in the expiratory channel for its virucidal effect. Results: The dynamic ventilatory divider system is capable of providing and controlling individual flow, tidal volume (TV) and Positive End-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for individual patients. Furthermore, it would also display the ventilatory parameters of both the patients, on a single split screen, in a familiar format. FiO2 and rate are still controlled by the mother ventilator. Conclusions: The prototype system has a potential to provide safe ventilation to at least two individuals from a single ventilator, while maintaining the unique requirements of each patient.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazhar, Rashid; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

WiFi connectivity data consists of sporadic connections between devices and nearby WiFi access points, each of which may cover a relatively large area within a building. Our system, entitled semantic LOCATion cleanER (LOCATER), postulates semantic localization as a series of data cleaning challenges - first, it treats the problem of determining the AP to which a device is connected between any two of its connection events as a missing value detection and repair problem. It then associates the device with the semantic subregion (e.g., a conference room in the region) by postulating it as a location disambiguation problem. We propose a bootstrapping semi-supervised learning method for the coarse localization and probabilistic method to achieve finer localization. We show that LOCATER can achieve significantly high accuracy at both the coarse and fine levels. LOCATER offers several benefits over traditional indoor localization approaches since it neither requires active cooperation from users (e.g., downloading code on a mobile device and communicating with the server) nor installing external hardware (e.g., network monitors).","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Yiming; Jiang, Daokun; Yus, Roberto; Bouloukakis, Georgios; Chio, Andrew; Mehrotra, Sharad; Venkatasubramanian, Nalini","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f630d64c02a5e9226ed771f7c23ab0d8ef44f66.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09676v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AP","LOCATER"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coarse localization","postulates semantic localization","WiFi connectivity data","LOCATER","finer localization","semantic subregion","semantic indoor locations","semantic LOCATion cleanER","series of data cleaning challenges","traditional indoor localization approaches","users","repair problem","location disambiguation problem","mobile device","probabilistic method","nearby WiFi access points","bootstrapping semi-supervised learning method","sporadic connections","devices","missing value detection","buildings","benefits","external hardware","connection events","regions","server","conference room","active cooperation","high accuracy","network monitors","code","system","paper","fine levels","large area","rooms"],"language":"en"},

The first is a data driven approach for predicting the Covid 19 pandemic dynamics, based on data from more advanced countries. The second is to report and discuss the results obtained with this approach for Brazilian states, as of May 4th, 2020. We start by presenting preliminary results obtained by training an LSTM SAE network, which are somewhat disappointing. Then, our main approach consists in an initial clustering of the world regions for which data is available and where the pandemic is at an advanced stage, based on a set of manually engineered features representing a country response to the early spread of the pandemic. A Modified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to estimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks. Finally, curve fitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks of the pandemic. Results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil, with most states peaks of infection estimated between the 25th of April and the 19th of May 2020. Predicted numbers reach a total of 240 thousand infected Brazilians, distributed among the different states, with S\\~ao Paulo leading with almost 65 thousands estimated, confirmed cases.

Since, tremendous efforts have been made worldwide to counter-steer and control the epidemic by now labelled as pandemic. In this contribution, we provide an overview on the potential for computer audition (CA), i.e., the usage of speech and sound analysis by artificial intelligence to help in this scenario. We first survey which types of related or contextually significant phenomena can be automatically assessed from speech or sound. These include the automatic recognition and monitoring of breathing, dry and wet coughing or sneezing sounds, speech under cold, eating behaviour, sleepiness, or pain to name but a few. Then, we consider potential use-cases for exploitation. These include risk assessment and diagnosis based on symptom histograms and their development over time, as well as monitoring of spread, social distancing and its effects, treatment and recovery, and patient wellbeing. We quickly guide further through challenges that need to be faced for real-life usage. We come to the conclusion that CA appears ready for implementation of (pre-)diagnosis and monitoring tools, and more generally provides rich and significant, yet so far untapped potential in the fight against COVID-19 spread.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schuller, Bjorn W.; Schuller, Dagmar M.; Qian, Kun; Liu, Juan; Zheng, Huaiyuan; Li, Xiao","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7842ce735861a2fdef23ed03f654cd88751e27cd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11117v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["monitoring of spread","usage of speech","monitoring of breathing","diagnosis","monitoring tools","untapped potential","potential use-cases","registered COVID","sound analysis","time of writing","significant phenomena","real-life usage","disease epidemic induced deaths","wet coughing","treatment","outbreak","sneezing sounds","symptom histograms","effects","implementation","artificial intelligence","social distancing","recovery","types of related","overview","behaviour","computer audition","fight","Corona virus","risk assessment","automatic recognition","months","sleepiness","patient wellbeing","world population","conclusion","development","exploitation","counter-steer","pain","survey","scenario","SARS-CoV","tremendous efforts","contribution","pandemic","challenges"],"language":"en"},

Billions of people around the world are asked to adhere to strict shelter-in-place rules, finalised to slow down the spread of the virus. Appeals and messages are being used by leaders and policy-makers to promote pandemic response. Given the stakes at play, it is thus important for social scientists to explore which messages are most effective in promoting pandemic response. In fact, some papers in the last month have explored the effect of several messages on people\u0027s intentions to engage in pandemic response behaviour. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we explore the effect of messages on people\u0027s actual engagement, and not on intentions. Specifically, our dependent variables are the level of understanding of official COVID-19 pandemic response governmental informative panels, measured through comprehension questions, and the time spent on reading these rules. Second, we test a novel set of appeals built through the theory of norms. One message targets the personal norm (what people think is the right thing to do), one targets the descriptive norm (what people think others are doing), and one targets the injunctive norm (what people think others approve or disapprove of). Our experiment is conducted online with a representative (with respect to gender, age, and location) sample of Italians. Norms are made salient using a flier. We find that norm-based fliers had no effect on comprehension and on time spent on the panels. These results suggest that norm-based interventions through fliers have very little impact on people\u0027s reading and understanding of COVID-19 pandemic response governmental rules.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bilancini, Ennio; Boncinelli, Leonardo; Capraro, Valerio; Celadin, Tatiana; Paolo, Roberto Di","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/811cd202c7384d14991f15718eec644349e7f635.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.03998v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic response governmental rules","pandemic response behaviour","effect of messages","pandemic response governmental informative panels","norm-based fliers","personal norm","descriptive norm","injunctive norm","Billions of people","norm-based interventions","people\u0027s intentions","people\u0027s reading","official COVID","world","message targets","place rules","people\u0027s actual engagement","comprehension questions","level of understanding","theory of norms","novel set of appeals","little impact","largest health threat","location","gender","recent times","policy-makers","strict shelter","representative","respect","dependent variables","new coronavirus disease","social scientists","leaders","results","lives of millions","sample of Italians","right thing","papers","play","month","spread","contributions","fact","stakes","experiment"],"language":"en"},

Traditional epidemiological models describe this as a result of non-pharmaceutical interventions that pushed the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this new phase of the pandemic many countries show an almost linear growth of confirmed cases for extended time-periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain by traditional models where infection numbers either grow explosively until herd immunity is reached, or the epidemic is completely suppressed (zero new cases). Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, $D_c$, below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above $D_c$ traditional epidemiological dynamics takes place, as e.g. in SIR-type models. When calibrating our corresponding model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find $D_c\\sim 7.2$. Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household-size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with a remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters. In particular we compare the US and Austria, as examples for one country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard compartmental models to describe the COVID-19 containment phase. The probability to observe linear growth in these is practically zero.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thurner, Stefan; Klimek, Peter; Hanel, Rudolf","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f03df940f4ab215b4f1e086d7a18b70c86aca1a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11302v1.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Austria"],"keyphrases":["growth rate","traditional models","Traditional epidemiological models","linear growth of confirmed cases","recovery rate","new cases","new phase","given transmission rate","infection numbers","traditional epidemiological dynamics","COVID","SIR-type models","countries","new containment regime","containment phase","lockdown measures","applicability of standard compartmental models","actual infection curves","low infection prevalence","structure of contact networks","realistic contact networks","number of days","epidemic peak","severe lockdown","critical number of social contacts","remarkable precision","extended time-periods","empirical estimates","place","result of non-pharmaceutical interventions","Austria","pandemic","puzzling observation","corresponding model","examples","fitting","findings","country","herd immunity","degree","explanation","household-size","sim","probability","parameters"],"language":"en"},

Based on trajectory provided by the big data and the mean field theory, we establish an aggregated risk mean field that contains information of all risk-spreading particles by proposing a spatio-temporal model named HiRES risk map. It has dynamic fine spatial resolution and high computation efficiency enabling fast update.

We conduct numerical experiments by applying the proposed methods to study the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Results show that the HiRES risk map has strong ability in capturing global trend and local variability of the epidemic risk, thus can be applied to monitor epidemic risk at country, province, city and community levels, as well as at specific high-risk locations such as hospital and station.

Calibration to the Covid-19 pandemic data suggests that catching the infection at the start was individually optimal and for some loss functions would have reduced the aggregate loss.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heinsalu, Sander","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d69d6f241a818e5027e2bfa8fb82fcdf3c5068f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08701v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM0LmNzdjs3ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1531092,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:28Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"6n80pYiHICEnZTXyuGfmbg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_34.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peak","healthcare capacity","loss functions","social loss","aggregate loss","epidemic","early patients","healthcare system","infection risk","number infected","pandemic data","Covid","greater likelihood","treatment","disease","Calibration","individual incentive","parameter values","reason","start","welfare"],"language":"en"},

However, viruses often evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid recognition by the antibodies (antigenic drift). This limitation of the antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity, which is able to recognize conserved viral HLA peptides presented on virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting conserved regions on the genome of a virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may work effectively on different strains of the virus. Here we propose a personalized workflow to identify an optimal set of T-cell epitopes based on the HLA alleles and the immunopeptidome of an individual person. Specifically, our workflow trains a machine learning model on the immunopeptidome and then predicts HLA peptides from conserved regions of a virus that are most likely to trigger responses from the person T cells.

However, robust and accurate screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays is still a globally recognized challenge because of two bottlenecks: 1) imaging features of COVID-19 share some similarities with other pneumonia on chest X-rays, and 2) the misdiagnosis rate of COVID-19 is very high, and the misdiagnosis cost is expensive. While a few pioneering works have made much progress, they underestimate both crucial bottlenecks. In this paper, we report our solution, discriminative cost-sensitive learning (DCSL), which should be the choice if the clinical needs the assisted screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays. DCSL combines both advantages from fine-grained classification and cost-sensitive learning. Firstly, DCSL develops a conditional center loss that learns deep discriminative representation. Secondly, DCSL establishes score-level cost-sensitive learning that can adaptively enlarge the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 examples into other classes. DCSL is so flexible that it can apply in any deep neural network. We collected a large-scale multi-class dataset comprised of 2,239 chest X-ray examples: 239 examples from confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1,000 examples with confirmed bacterial or viral pneumonia cases, and 1,000 examples of healthy people. Extensive experiments on the three-class classification show that our algorithm remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. It achieves an accuracy of 97.01%, a precision of 97%, a sensitivity of 97.09%, and an F1-score of 96.98%.

We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogeneous situations across provinces. The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. Borrowing from the experience of China, we made scenario projections on the development of the outbreak in other countries. We identified that Europe and US have passed the inflection point and entered into an after-peak trajectory, which is estimated longer than what a classical Logistic model predicts, in contrast to most provinces in China where the after-peak trajectory is much faster.

We introduce a novel framework to model (non-)Markovian susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) stochastic processes that are evolving either in continuous or discrete time on networks. We apply our simulation framework to study hybrid SIR processes that describe infections as discrete-time Markovian and recovery events as continuous-time non-Markovian processes, which mimic the distribution of cell-cycle times. Our results suggest that the effective-spreading-rate description of epidemic processes fails to uniquely capture the behavior of such hybrid and also general non-Markovian disease dynamics.

Among these, five clones (C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2) were identified to secrete monoclonal IgG antibodies. When the monoclonal IgG antibodies from the 5 clones were tested for their antigen specificity, they recognized GP in an antigen-specific and IgG dose-dependent manner. They remained reactive to GP at the lowest tested concentrations (1.953\u20137.8 ng/mL). In particular, IgG antibodies from clones D11-3, D12-1, and E140-2 recognized the native forms of GP expressed on the cell surface. These antibodies were identified as IgG1, IgG2a, or IgG2b kappa types and appeared to recognize the native forms of GP, but not the denatured forms of GP, as determined by Western blot assay. Despite their GP-binding activity, none of the IgG antibodies neutralized Ebola virus infection in vitro, suggesting that these antibodies are unable to neutralize Ebola virus infection. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the purified IgG antibodies from 5 clones (C36-1, D11-3, D12-1, D34-2, and E140-2) possess GP-binding activity but not Ebola virus-neutralizing activity.","publish_time":"2018-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Baek-Sang; Jang, Ho-Young; Racine, Trina; Qiu, Xiangguo; Sin, Jeong-Im","journal":"Clin Exp Vaccine Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5faed882955e964aa9ea7ac455746bcfec521ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6082671.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30112351/; https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2018.7.2.119","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["GP vaccines","specific IgG antibodies","GP-binding activity","purified IgG antibodies","GP-specific hybridoma","native forms of GP","ability of monoclonal IgG antibodies","denatured forms of GP","IgG heavy","GP DNA vaccines","Ebola virus infection","Western blot assay","possible IgG producer","clones D11","hybridoma clones","Ebola virus glycoprotein","IgG dose-dependent manner","Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","D12","E140","antigen-specific","hybridoma production","study","C36","D34","cell supernatants","antigen specificity","cell surface","lowest tested concentrations","light chains","presence","flow cytometry","intramuscular-electroporation","mice","IgG2a","IgG2b kappa types","METHODS","IgG1","hybridomas","MATERIALS","PURPOSE","goal","RESULTS","spleen cells","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R(0), of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R(0). Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern. The under-reporting was likely to have resulted in 469 (95% CI: 403\u2013540) unreported cases from 1 to 15 January 2020. The reporting rate after 17 January 2020 was likely to have increased 21-fold (95% CI: 18\u201325) in comparison to the situation from 1 to 17 January 2020 on average. We estimated the R(0) of 2019-nCoV at 2.56 (95% CI: 2.49\u20132.63). Conclusion: The under-reporting was likely to have occurred during the first half of January 2020 and should be considered in future investigation.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Shi; Musa, Salihu S.; Lin, Qianying; Ran, Jinjun; Yang, Guangpu; Wang, Weiming; Lou, Yijun; Yang, Lin; Gao, Daozhou; He, Daihai; Wang, Maggie H.","journal":"J Clin Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7074332.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9020388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32024089/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["nCoV cases","number of unreported cases","under-reporting","CI","basic reproduction number","exponential growth pattern","number of foreign countries","mainland China","parts of China","reporting rate","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","outbreak of respiratory illness","initial growth phase","unknown SI","SARS","CoVs","MERS","infection","well-known coronaviruses","approximations","novel coronavirus","epidemic curve","serial intervals","maximum likelihood estimation","Conclusion","Methods","fold","Wuhan","comparison","situation","future investigation","Results","Background","average","half"],"language":"en"},

Little information exists to describe this population, its dynamics and associated management practices. The aim of this study was to carry out a census of un-owned cats and dogs in the UK in 2010, and to document the origins, destinations, husbandry and costs associated with the care of these animals. RESULTS: A sampling frame was constructed by searching the databases of publicly registered charities for England, Scotland and Wales, registers of breed rescues, and by internet searches of animal welfare websites. Overall, 2,352 contacts for 1,380 organisations were identified. All were sent a postal questionnaire asking for data on the number of dogs and cats housed, their origins and eventual outcomes, and details of husbandry between January 1(st) and December 31(st) 2010. For those which were registered charities (595), financial records were also obtained. A response rate of 38.8% was obtained. Overall, in 2010, 89,571 dogs and 156,826 cats entered the care of the participating organisations. Approximately half of these animals were relinquished by their owners. Other origins included being found as strays or confiscated for welfare purposes. Seventy-five per cent of dogs and 77.1% of cats were rehomed. The next most common outcome was euthanasia, accounting for 10.4% of dogs and 13.2% cats. For dogs and cats, 44.3% and 62% of participants respectively reported having a waiting list, which frequently exceeded the actual capacity of the facility. Over 19,000 people were involved in the care of these animals, on a paid or voluntary basis. Financial records were available for 519/595 (87.2%) of the registered charities, and their total expenditure in 2010 was \u00A3340 million. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a large number of animals become un-owned each year, which could have considerable implications for their welfare. Despite the resources expended, demand still exceeds capacity for many organisations, and a substantial number of both cats and dogs are euthanased, suggesting that further understanding of how and why these animals become un-owned is essential in order to target interventions.","publish_time":"2012-09-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stavisky, Jenny; Brennan, Marnie L; Downes, Martin; Dean, Rachel","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f9d106c41459601d3804f9db29621c92c321921.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3514250.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22974242/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-163","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs1ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["England","Scotland","Wales"],"keyphrases":["number of dogs","population of dogs","cent of dogs","census of un-owned cats","registered charities","large number of animals","origins","care","compromised welfare","welfare purposes","substantial number","study","participating organisations","financial records","internet searches of animal welfare websites","details of husbandry","actual capacity","associated management practices","Wales","England","Scotland","registers of breed rescues","rescue shelters","increased susceptibility","eventual outcomes","disease","dynamics","accounting","databases","order","year","costs","common outcome","euthanasia","considerable implications","demand","destinations","total expenditure","strays","UK","waiting list","sampling frame","postal questionnaire","voluntary basis","participants","RESULTS","interventions","facility","resources","Little information","BACKGROUND","response rate","aim","CONCLUSIONS","contacts","people","half","owners","understanding"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To assess preventive effects of meditation and exercise on acute respiratory infection (ARI) illness. DESIGN: Randomized controlled prevention trial with three parallel groups. SETTING: Madison, Wisconsin, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Community-recruited adults who did not regularly exercise or meditate. METHODS: 1) 8-week behavioral training in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR); 2) matched 8-week training in moderate intensity sustained exercise (EX); or 3) observational waitlist control. Training classes occurred in September and October, with weekly ARI surveillance through May. Incidence, duration, and area-under-curve ARI global severity were measured using daily reports on the WURSS-24 during ARI illness. Viruses were identified multiplex PCR. Absenteeism, health care utilization, and psychosocial health self-report assessments were also employed. RESULTS: Of 413 participants randomized, 390 completed the trial. In the MBSR group, 74 experienced 112 ARI episodes with 1045 days of ARI illness. Among exercisers, 84 had 120 episodes totaling 1010 illness days. Eighty-two of the controls had 134 episodes with 1210 days of ARI illness. Mean global severity was 315 for MBSR (95% confidence interval 244, 386), 256 (193, 318) for EX, and 336 (268, 403) for controls. A prespecified multivariate zero-inflated regression model suggested reduced incidence for MBSR (p = 0.036) and lower global severity for EX (p = 0.042), compared to control, not quite attaining the p\u003C0.025 prespecified cut-off for null hypothesis rejection. There were 73 ARI-related missed-work days and 22 ARI-related health care visits in the MBSR group, 82 days and 21 visits for exercisers, and 105 days and 24 visits among controls. Viruses were identified in 63 ARI episodes in the MBSR group, compared to 64 for EX and 72 for control. Statistically significant (p\u003C0.05) improvements in general mental health, self-efficacy, mindful attention, sleep quality, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were observed in the MBSR and/or EX groups, compared to control.

As the transmissibility of a pathogen increases, the dynamics of disease spread shifts from limited stuttering chains of transmission to potentially large scale outbreaks. One proposed method to anticipate this transition are early-warning signals (EWS), summary statistics which undergo characteristic changes as the transition is approached. Although theoretically predicted, their mathematical basis does not take into account the nature of epidemiological data, which are typically aggregated into periodic case reports and subject to reporting error. The viability of EWS for epidemic transitions therefore remains uncertain. Here we demonstrate that most EWS can predict emergence even when calculated from imperfect data. We quantify performance using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic, a measure of how well an EWS distinguishes between numerical simulations of an emerging disease and one which is stationary. Values of the AUC statistic are compared across a range of different reporting scenarios. We find that different EWS respond to imperfect data differently. The mean, variance and first differenced variance all perform well unless reporting error is highly overdispersed. The autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well provided that the aggregation period of the data is larger than the serial interval and reporting error is not highly overdispersed. The coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis are found to be unreliable indicators of emergence. Overall, we find that seven of ten EWS considered perform well for most realistic reporting scenarios. We conclude that imperfect epidemiological data is not a barrier to using EWS for many potentially emerging diseases.","publish_time":"2018-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brett, Tobias S.; O\u2019Dea, Eamon B.; Marty, \u00C9ric; Miller, Paige B.; Park, Andrew W.; Drake, John M.; Rohani, Pejman","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6981b83471474649ada35c45fe43e091aab4553.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6010299.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29883444/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EWS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different EWS","reporting error","imperfect data","viability of EWS","imperfect epidemiological data","nature of epidemiological data","realistic reporting scenarios","range of different reporting scenarios","dynamics of disease","Epidemic transitions","AUC statistic","differenced variance","emerging diseases","important feature of infectious disease systems","unreliable indicators of emergence","limited stuttering chains of transmission","shifts","summary statistics","kurtosis","account","subject","serial interval","periodic case reports","warning signals","large scale outbreaks","characteristic changes","pathogen increases","curve","numerical simulations","barrier","decay time","aggregation period","autocorrelation","autocovariance","coefficient of variation","skewness","area","mean","measure","performance","mathematical basis","transmissibility","proposed method","Values"],"language":"en"},

It is the responsibility of the leaders and managers of the ED to ensure that their teams work in an environment where they can deliver the best care to their patients. This environment is defined by people, system and place. People are the most important asset of the ED. One of the most important responsibilities of the ED leaders and managers (senior management) is to foster teamwork.

Taking a pragmatic stance, this paper seeks to identify certain key threats associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies, giving voice to those in the literature on different sides of the debate. Novel literature is considered that suggests that innovations in the discovery, or research process itself, may hold the key to developing certain collaborative capabilities that can amplify collective intelligence. These capabilities are discussed together with their potential to meet the challenges associated with the proliferation of dangerous technologies. Testable propositions are derived from literature, and four technological scenarios are developed for analysis. Certain key challenges are identified and discussed in relation to each of the technological scenarios. In doing so, what are hopefully useful insights are derived for how changes can be made in the present to help avoid meeting the fates described by certain of these scenarios.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Callaghan, Chris William","journal":"Futures","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b5c28b2f565251b77c83f373fbbc215f697beb1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094529.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016328718300983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226096/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328718300983; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2018.08.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["technological scenarios","Certain key challenges","certain key threats","certain collaborative capabilities","Abstract Certain future scenarios of technological change","proliferation of dangerous technologies","Novel literature","paper","voice","collective intelligence","changes","discovery","research process","innovations","different sides","debate","predictions","fates","relation","useful insights","pragmatic stance","Testable propositions","potential","analysis","Fewer"],"language":"en"},

Treatment options are scarce, and new drugs with novel mechanisms of action are needed. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide, a thiazolide anti-infective, for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 trial in 74 primary care clinics in the USA between Dec 27, 2010, and April 30, 2011. We enrolled participants aged 12\u201365 years with fever, at least one respiratory symptom, and one constitutional symptom of influenza within 48 h of symptom onset. We randomly assigned participants to receive either nitazoxanide 600 mg, nitazoxanide 300 mg, or placebo twice daily for 5 days, (ratio 1:1:1) and followed them up for 28 days. Randomisation lists were computer generated and done in blocks of three. Sponsor, investigators, study monitors, patients, and laboratory personnel were all masked to treatment allocation in the study. The primary endpoint was the time from first dose to alleviation of symptoms. The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat for participants with influenza infection confirmed by RT-PCR or culture at baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01227421. FINDINGS: Of 650 participants screened, 624 (96%) were enrolled. Of these, 212 were randomly assigned to receive placebo twice a day, 201 to receive nitazoxanide 300 mg twice a day, and 211 to receive nitazoxanide 600 mg a day. The median duration of symptoms for participants receiving placebo was 116\u00B77 h (95% CI 108\u00B71\u2013122\u00B71) compared with 95\u00B75 h (84\u00B70\u2013108\u00B70; p=0\u00B70084) for those receiving 600 mg nitazoxanide and 109\u00B71 h (96\u00B71\u2013129\u00B75, p=0\u00B752) for those receiving 300 mg nitazoxanide. Adverse events were similar between the three groups, the most common being headache reported by 24 (11%) of 212 patients enrolled in placebo group, 12 (6%) of 201 patients in the low-dose group, and 17 (8%) of 211 patients in the high-dose group, or diarrhoea, reported by seven (3%) patients in the placebo group, four (2%) patients enrolled in the low-dose group, and 17 (8%) patients in the high-dose group. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily for 5 days was associated with a reduction of the duration of symptoms in participants with acute uncomplicated influenza. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to assess efficacy of the drug alone or in combination with existing drugs in seriously ill patients and those at risk of influenza complications.

The outbreak occurred in a dairy herd of southern Italy in the first decade of September 2006, when summer temperatures were still recorded, affecting calves, heifers and adult cows, with a marked decrease in milk production. By virus isolation and RT-PCR targeting the S gene, BCoV was identified as the etiological agent of the outbreak, whereas bacteriological, parasitological and toxicological investigations failed to detect other causes of disease. BCoV strains with 99\u2013100% nucleotide identity in the S gene were isolated from nasal, ocular and rectal swabs, thus proving the absence of separate clusters of virus on the basis of tissue tropism. Sequence analysis of the haemagglutination-esterase and spike proteins of the strain detected in one rectal sample (339/06) showed a high genetic relatedness with recent BCoV isolates (98\u201399% amino acid identity), with several unique amino acid substitutions in the S protein.

Previous studies have shown that the PRRSV nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) is an important mediator of this process, but the underlying molecular details remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that the PRRSV nsp4 interacted with the mitochondrial inner membrane protein cytochrome c1 (cyto.c1) and induced its proteolytic cleavage. Interestingly, the cleaved N-terminal fragment of cyto.c1 was found to exert apoptotic activity, which could cause mitochondrial fragmentation, resulting in apoptotic cell death. And RNA interference (RNAi) silencing experiments further confirmed the crucial role which cyto.c1 played in nsp4- and PRRSV-induced cell apoptosis. Thus, our data provide an important piece of mechanistic clues for PRRSV-induced cell apoptosis and also elucidate a novel mechanism for the 3C-like proteases in this finding.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"ZHANG, Feng; GAO, Peng; GE, Xin-na; ZHOU, Lei; GUO, Xin; YANG, Han-chun","journal":"Journal of Integrative Agriculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3b19ae006221e8eba986cc505e02f54174bd1f9e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095311917616708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288954/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2095-3119(17)61670-8; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095311917616708","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV nsp4","PRRSV-induced cell apoptosis","PRRSV nonstructural protein","apoptotic cell death","mitochondrial inner membrane protein cytochrome c1","mitochondrial fragmentation","important mediator","apoptotic activity","cleaved N-terminal fragment of cyto","important piece of mechanistic clues","respiratory syndrome virus","silencing experiments","process","crucial role","RNA interference","RNAi","novel mechanism","underlying molecular details","data","Previous studies","proteases","finding","proteolytic cleavage","viral pathogenesis","study"],"language":"en"},

A recent meta-analysis provides support for prolonged corticosteroid treatment in ALI-ARDS. We prospectively evaluated the response to oseltamivir and prolonged corticosteroid treatment in patients with ALI-ARDS and suspected H1N1 influenza. METHODS: From June 24 through 12 July 2009, 13 patients with suspected H1N1 pneumonia and ALI-ARDS were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital. H1N1 influenza was confirmed with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay in eight patients. Oseltamivir and corticosteroid treatment were initiated concomitantly at ICU admission; those with severe ARDS received methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), and others received hydrocortisone (300 mg/day) for a duration of 21 \u00B1 6 days. RESULTS: Patients with and without confirmed H1N1 influenza had similar disease severity at presentation and a comparable response to treatment. By day 7 of treatment, patients experienced a significant improvement in lung injury and multiple organ dysfunction scores (P \u003C 0.001). Twelve patients (92%) improved lung function, were extubated, and discharged alive from the ICU. Hospital length of stay and mortality were 18.7 \u00B1 9.6 days and 15%, respectively. Survivors were discharged home without oxygen supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: In ARDS patients, with and without confirmed H1N1 influenza, prolonged low-to-moderate dose corticosteroid treatment was well tolerated and associated with significant improvement in lung injury and multiple organ dysfunction scores and a low hospital mortality. These findings provide the rationale for developing a randomized trial.","publish_time":"2009-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quispe-Laime, Adolfo Maximo; Bracco, Jonas Daniel; Barberio, Patricia Alejandra; Campagne, Claudio German; Rolfo, Ver\u00F3nica Edith; Umberger, Reba; Meduri, Gianfranco Umberto","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dec7381c85a7ebd957e7a673b6e5a7fc73de5bec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080155.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19924393/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-009-1727-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM2LmNzdjs5MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1683579,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"yKF8S7PY9yrIrBS7Jtj5rA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_36.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARDS patients","ALI-ARDS","minority of patients","prolonged corticosteroid treatment","suspected H1N1 influenza","severe ARDS","suspected H1N1 pneumonia","acute lung injury","moderate dose corticosteroid treatment","low hospital mortality","multiple organ dysfunction scores","significant improvement","improved lung function","ICU admission","tertiary care hospital","oseltamivir","Hospital length","days","progressive pneumonia","comparable response","intensive care unit","acute respiratory distress syndrome","real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay","presentation","support","similar disease severity","recent meta-analysis","virus pandemic","rationale","Survivors","oxygen supplementation","randomized trial","methylprednisolone","duration","hydrocortisone","PURPOSE","CONCLUSIONS","findings","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Hence, new types of technologies have to be established which enables a multiparameter analysis at the point-of-care. Within this review-like article a system called Fraunhofer ivD-platform is introduced. It consists of a credit-card sized cartridge with integrated reagents, sensors and pumps and a read-out/processing unit. Within the cartridge the assay runs fully automated within 15-20 minutes. Due to the open design of the platform different analyses such as antibody, serological or DNA-assays can be performed.

Most backyard chicken flocks have a poor level of biosecurity, which increases the risk of spread of diseases. In recent years, the number of backyard chickens has been on the rise in Iran. However, the health status of backyard flocks is still poorly documented. Thus, this study aimed at examining the seroprevalence of antibodies against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and molecular surveillance and genotyping of IBV among backyard chickens (without vaccination history) in Mazandaran province, North of Iran, 2014. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 460 blood samples of unvaccinated backyard chickens in the mentioned area were tested for antibodies against IBV using commercial ELISA. Also, cecal tonsils were collected from 75 chickens in the same area. Real time RT-PCR (for detection) and RT-PCR and sequencing spike gene were performed. RESULTS: The seropositivity rate was 54.5%. In addition, we detected 793/B, Variant 2, and QX in the backyard flocks and performed phylogenetic studies on them. The phylogenetic study revealed that the detected genotypes had high homology with IBV strains that were infected broilers, pullets, and layers in Iran. CONCLUSION: There is a need for continuous monitoring of IBV among avian species to complete the epidemiological map and work on the pathogenesis of Iranian IBV strains in Iranian backyard chickens.","publish_time":"2018-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shokri, Shima; Karimi, Vahid; Langeroudi, Arash Ghalyanchi; Marandi, Mehdi Vasfi; Hashamzadeh, Masoud; Zabihipetroudi, Taha; Najafi, Hamideh; Tehrani, Farshad","journal":"Iran J Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53408b1daf9132c89bebd23cdd7e417ad668b1ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6004632.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6004632/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["North","Iran"],"keyphrases":["Iranian backyard chickens","number of backyard chickens","backyard chicken flocks","blood samples of unvaccinated backyard chickens","health status of backyard flocks","pathogenesis of Iranian IBV strains","continuous monitoring of IBV","phylogenetic studies","North of Iran","phylogenetic study","Different epidemiological studies","epidemiological map","seroprevalence of antibodies","Real time RT-PCR","detected genotypes","mentioned area","poultry diseases","avian species","infectious bronchitis virus","vaccination history","infected broilers","high homology","total","Mazandaran province","pullets","detection","work","molecular surveillance","poor level of biosecurity","layers","sequencing spike gene","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVES","need","QX","reservoir","recent years","METHODS","commercial ELISA","rise","RESULTS","seropositivity rate","MATERIALS","Variant","risk","cecal tonsils","addition","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

It remains unclear why children and young adults are less severely affected than older individuals, but this might involve differences in immune system function in the elderly and/or differences in the expression/function of the cellular receptor for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Laboratory findings and chest imaging may not be specific in children with COVID-19. Diagnosis is by Reverse transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of upper or lower respiratory tract secretions. This review additionally considers COVID-19 in immunosuppressed children, and also suggests a management algorithm for the few children who appear to present with life threatening infection, including the potential use of antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment.

While exhibiting a relatively similar upper body motion to the bench press, there are substantial differences in repetitions when employing similar relative loads. The objective was to examine sex-related differences in repetitions and muscle activation associated with push-ups and bench press exercises. Twenty resistance-trained participants (10 men [22 \u00B1 6.1 years] and 10 [24 \u00B1 5.7 years] women) performed maximum push-up and bench press repetitions with loads relative to the body mass during a push-up. Electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were positioned on the middle and anterior deltoids, triceps and biceps brachii, and pectoralis major muscles and their relative (normalized to a maximum voluntary contraction) activity was compared between the two exercises performed to task failure. Both females (3.5 \u00B1 3.9 vs.15.5 \u00B1 8.0 repetitions; p = 0.0008) and males (12.0 \u00B1 6.3 vs. 25.6 \u00B1 5.2 repetitions; p \u003C 0.0001) performed 77.4% and 53.1% less bench press than push-up repetitions respectively. Males significantly exceeded females with both push-ups (p = 0.01) and bench press (p = 0.004) repetitions. Significant linear regression equations were found for females (r2 = 0.55; p = 0.03), and males (r2 = 0.66; p \u003C 0.0001) indicating that bench press repetitions increased 0.36 and 0.97 for each push-up repetition for females and males respectively. Triceps (p = 0.002) and biceps brachii (p = 0.03) EMG mean amplitude was significantly lower during the push-up concentric phase, while the anterior deltoid (p = 0.03) exhibited less activity during the bench press eccentric phase.

As the National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine is the primary medical care center for COVID-19 inZhejiang Province. Based on the present expert consensus carried out by National Health Commission and National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, our team summarized and established an effective treatment strategy centered on \u0022Four-Anti and Two-Balance\u0022 for clinical practice. The \u0022Four-Anti and Two-Balance\u0022strategy included antivirus, anti-shock, anti-hyoxemia, anti-secondary infection, and maintaining of water, electrolyte and acid base balance and microecological balance. Meanwhile, integrated multidisciplinarypersonalized treatment was recommended to improve therapeutic effect. The importance of early viralogical detection, dynamic monitoring of inflammatory indexes and chest radiograph was emphasized in clinical decision-making. Sputum was observed with the highest positive rate of RT-PCR results. Viral nucleic acids could be detected in10% patients\u0027blood samples at acute periodand 50% of patients had positive RT-PCR results in their feces. We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. The \u0022Four-Anti and Two-Balance\u0022strategyeffectively increased cure rate and reduced mortality. Early antiviral treatment could alleviate disease severity and prevent illness progression, and we found lopinavir/ritonavir combined with abidol showed antiviraleffects in COVID-19. Shock and hypoxemia were usually caused by cytokine storms. The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness. For cases of severe illness, early and also short periods of moderate glucocorticoid was supported. Patients with oxygenation index below 200 mmHg should be transferred to intensive medical center. Conservative oxygen therapy was preferred and noninvasive ventilation was not recommended. Patients with mechanical ventilation should be strictly supervised with cluster ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention strategies. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be prescribed rationally and was not recommended except for patients with long course of disease, repeated fever and elevated procalcitonin (PCT), meanwhile secondary fungal infection should be concerned.Some patients with COVID-19 showed intestinal microbialdysbiosis with decreasedprobiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Nutritional and gastrointestinal function should be assessed for all patients.Nutritional support and application of prebiotics or probiotics were suggested to regulate the balance of intestinal microbiota and reduce the risk of secondary infection due to bacterial translocation. Anxiety and fear were common in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we established dynamic assessment and warning for psychological crisis. We also integrated Chinese medicine in treatment to promote disease rehabilitation through classification methods of traditional Chinese medicine. We optimized nursing process for severe patients to promote their rehabilitation. It remained unclear about viral clearance pattern after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, two weeks\u0027 quarantine for discharged patients was required and a regular following up was also needed.The Zhejiang experience above and suggestions have been implemented in our center and achieved good results. However, since COVID-19 was a newly emerging disease, more work was warranted to improve strategies of prevention, diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Kaijin; Cai, Hongliu; Shen, Yihong; Ni, Qin; Chen, Yu; Hu, Shaohua; Li, Jianping; Wang, Huafen; Yu, Liang; Huang, He; Qiu, Yunqing; Wei, Guoqing; Fang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianying; Sheng, Jifang; Liang, Tingbo; Li, Lanjuan","journal":"Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

This paper presents initial intensive-care unit (ICU) experiences with COVID-19 patients at Roskilde Hospital, which was the primary recipient of COVID-19 patients in need of intensive care in the Zealand Region, Denmark. METHODS An evaluation was conducted of the COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure from 11 March 2020 to 01 April 2020. The number of ICU beds was increased from eight to 22 beds during this period. RESULTS Sixteen patients (four women) were evaluated. The median age was 69.5 years (range: 56-84 years). All the patients were admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and all needed mechanical ventilation by orotracheal intubation. By 16 April, six patients were still admitted to the ICU, four patients had been discharged from the ICU and seven had died. At present, the average length of ICU stay is 14 \u00B1 9 days (mean \u00B1 standard deviation). One patient has remained on ventilatory support for 31 days. The evaluation revealed four key themes. COVID-19 patients 1) had greatly increased C-reactive protein levels, 2) needed a significant inspiratory O2fraction, 3) were highly positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) dependent on ventilatory support and 4) suffered highly fluctuating respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support for a significantly longer period of time than non-COVID-19 patients.

With the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2, there are now seven human coronaviruses. Those that cause mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic species are SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are spherical (125nm diameter), and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface giving the appearance of a solar corona. Within the helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is the large positive sense, single stranded RNA. Of the four coronavirus genera (\u03B1,\u03B2,\u03B3,\u03B4), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are classified under \u03B1-CoV (HCoV-229E and NL63) and \u03B2-CoV (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoVOC43 and HCoV-HKU1). SARS-CoV-2 is a \u03B2-CoV and shows fairly close relatedness with two bat-derived CoV-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Even so, its genome is similar to that of the typical CoVs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, and it appears to be so for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The possibility of an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans has already been shown with civet cats acting as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoVs, and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV. Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact of respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. The coronaviral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, all of which are encoded within the 3\u0027 end of the genome. The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors resulting in fusion and subsequent viral entry. The M protein is the most abundant protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. The E protein is the smallest of the major structural proteins and participates in viral assembly and budding. The N protein is the only one that binds to the RNA genome and is also involved in viral assembly and budding. Replication of coronaviruses begin with attachment and entry. Attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S protein and its specific receptor. Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes. Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs resulting in the formation of the mature virus. Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malik, Y A","journal":"The Malaysian journal of pathology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32342926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","\u03B2-CoV","\u03B1-CoV","bat-derived CoV","E protein","SARS-CoVs","viral assembly","discovery of SARS","N protein","human coronaviruses","abundant protein","cleavage of S protein","viral envelope","RNA genome","recent detection of SARS","Replication of coronaviruses","host cell surface receptors","host cell cytosol","mature virus","viral replicase complexes","subsequent viral entry","attachment","bat-SL","human transmission","coronaviral genome","direct contact","fusion","major structural proteins","virion genomic RNA","translation","single stranded RNA","subgenomic RNA synthesis","HCoV-HKU1","NL63","budding","close contact of respiratory droplets","close relatedness","replicase gene","intermediate hosts","symmetrical nucleocapsid","typical CoVs","receptor binding","specific receptor","large positive sense","family Coronaviridae","CoVZC45","order Nidovirales","subfamily Orthocoronavirinae","encapsidation","infected individuals","smallest","pathogenic species","dromedary camels","HCoVOC43","protease enzyme","appearance","civet cats","HCoVs","emergence","interactions","club-shaped spikes","contaminated objects","coronavirus genera","nm diameter","surfaces","formation","humans","CoVZXC21","cellular membranes","vesicles","virions","solar corona","mild diseases","exocytosis","step","possibility","bats","end"],"language":"en"},

Through institutional improvement and policy support, the government should help healthcare personnel and LTCHs improve installation and raise the level of knowledge of infection prevention and control. With these improvement, prevention, surveillance, and screening for COVID-19 should be done and a response system to the COVID-19 outbreak should be established.

However, modern contrast agents are well tolerated with a low risk of aspiration. Our current guidelines recommend fasting four to six hours before elective and semi-urgent cardiac catheterisation despite a lack of evidence to support this. We sought to determine the duration and effects of fasting at our centre. METHODS A single-centre prospective observational study in patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterisation over a six-month period between 7 August 2017 to 7 February 2018 at Auckland City Hospital, New Zealand. RESULTS One thousand and thirty patients with a mean age of 66\u00B112 years underwent catheterisation. Sixty-seven percent were male, 26% had diabetes, 72% had hypertension and 23% had stage 3 or worse chronic kidney disease. The mean duration of fasting was 11.6\u00B14.9 hours with 80% fasting longer than recommended. One hundred and eight (48%) patients with documented chronic kidney disease did not receive recommended pre-hydration. The most common symptoms related to fasting were hunger (47 %), nausea (3.9%) and vomiting (0.8%). Hypertension (4.1%) and hyperglycaemia (0.8%) occurred due to missed medication. There were no reports of aspiration. CONCLUSION Most patients were fasted for significantly longer than recommended and pre-hydration was underutilised in patients at high risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. There were no episodes of aspiration with modern contrast agents. Further studies are required to evaluate the need for fasting prior to non-emergency cardiac catheterisation.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bacus, Sheila Badana; Parsons, John; Benatar, Jocelyne; Somaratne, Jithendra; Webster, Mark; Parke, Rachael","journal":"The New Zealand medical journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32078597/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["patients","mean duration of fasting","elective cardiac catheterisation","high risk of contrast","modern contrast agents","low risk of aspiration","episodes of aspiration","reports of aspiration","semi-urgent cardiac catheterisation","recommended pre-hydration","non-emergency cardiac catheterisation","Previous generation contrast agents","hours","hypertension","vomiting","worse chronic kidney disease","documented chronic kidney disease","high rates of nausea","mean age","single-centre prospective observational study","stage","Auckland City Hospital","New Zealand","METHODS","need","hunger","lack of evidence","induced nephropathy","six-month period","common symptoms","years","recommendations","male","diabetes","effects","current guidelines","percent","procedure","studies","hyperglycaemia","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","medication"],"language":"en"},

In this pandemic, the need for uninterrupted generation of future doctors is felt more than ever in our living memory. Continuity of medical education is thus imperative. While \u0022Live\u0022 patient contact is an irreplaceable tenet of clinical teaching, these extraordinary times demand exceptional measures. Pedagogical innovations involving technology and simulation based teaching (Online lectures, video vase vignettes, virtual simulators, webcasting, online chat-rooms) need to be brought to the forefront.

Meanwhile, the students, whose medical educations are stuck in this pandemic time, should realize that there is no bigger teacher than a first-hand experience, and they are eyewitnesses to the making of history.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sahi, Puneet Kaur; Mishra, Devendra; Singh, Tejinder","journal":"Indian pediatrics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412913/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMzLmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1385596,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"z5zF8sgn4d0VNeVIVUEKoA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_33.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Continuity of medical education","medical educations","medical educators","education uncertain","need","coronavirus pandemic","pandemic time","technology-based learning","Online lectures","irreplaceable tenet of clinical teaching","clinical setting","online chat-rooms","virtual simulators","video vase vignettes","webcasting","simulation","extraordinary times","spread","important preventive strategy","patient contact","uninterrupted generation of future doctors","eyewitnesses","first-hand experience","contagion","application","universities","Social distancing","exceptional measures","Pedagogical innovations","bigger teacher","Closure of schools","sustainability","mankind","countries","complete lock","making of history","vaccine","levels","students","living memory","core","Implementation","forefront"],"language":"en"},

We report our experience with, and technique for, robotic first rib resection. METHODS Patients diagnosed with TOS underwent robotic first rib resection of the offending portion of the first rib with disarticulation of the costo-sternal joint. Definitive diagnosis of TOS was made by Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) with maneuvers. RESULTS A total of 67 patients underwent robotic first rib resection. Neurogenic TOS: 39 patients underwent robotic resection for Neurologic Symptoms of the upper extremity (Neurogenic TOS). There were 14 men and 25 women, with a mean age of 34 \u00B1 9.5 years. Paget-Schroetter Syndrome (PSS) or Venous TOS: 28 patients underwent transthoracic robotic first rib resection for PSS. There were 16 men and 12 women, with a mean age of 24 \u00B1 8.5 years. Operative time was 87.6 \u00B1 10.8 minutes. There were no intraoperative complications. Hospital stay ranged from 2 to 4 days with a median hospitalization of 3 days. There were no neurovascular complications. There was no mortality. In patients with Neurogenic TOS, QuickDASH Scores (mean \u00B1 SEM) decreased from 60.3 \u00B1 2.1 preoperatively to 5 \u00B1 2.3 in the immediate postoperative period and to 3.5 \u00B1 1.1 at 6 months (p\u003C0001). Immediate relief of symptoms was seen in 35/39 patients (91%). Persistent paresthesia was seen in 4/39 (9%) immediately postop, and in 2/39 (2.5%) at 6 months. Thirty-seven of 39 (97.5%) patients reported complete relief of symptoms. Among patients with PSS or Venous TOS, 9/28 (32%) required endovascular venoplasty to completely open the subclavian vein after the relief of extrinsic compression. At a median follow-up of 24 months, all patients with PSS had an open subclavian vein, for a patency rate of 100%.

Methods The activity of a vascular surgery unit was analysed from 8 March to 8 April 2020. Surgical activity was maintained only for acute or elective procedures obeying priority criteria. The preventive screening protocol consisted of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for all patients and physicians with symptoms and for unprotected contact infected cases, and serological physician evaluations every 15 days. Patients treated in the acute setting were considered theoretically infected and the necessary protective devices were used. The number of patients and the possible infection of physicians were evaluated. The number and type of interventions and the need for post-operative IC during this period were compared with those in the same periods in 2018 and 2019. Results One hundred and fifty-one interventions were performed, of which 34 (23%) were acute/emergency. The total number of interventions was similar to those performed in the same periods in 2019 and 2018: 150 (33, of which 22% acute/emergency) and 117 (29, 25% acute/emergency), respectively. IC was necessary after 6% (17% in 2019 and 20% in 2018) of elective operations and 33% (11) of acute/emergency interventions. None of the patients treated electively were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection during hospitalisation. Of the 34 patients treated in acute/emergency interventions, five (15%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. It was necessary to screen 14 (47%) vascular surgeons with NPS after contact with infected colleagues, but none for unprotected contact with patients; all were found to be negative on NPS and serological evaluation. Conclusion A dedicated protocol allowed maintenance of regular elective vascular surgery activity during the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, with no contamination of patients or physicians and minimal need for IC resources.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pini, Rodolfo; Faggioli, Gianluca; Vacirca, Andrea; Gallitto, Enrico; Mascoli, Chiara; Attard, Luciano; Viale, Pierluigi; Gargiulo, Mauro","journal":"European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19ab37d7e2e8fa1bfcab1b36abb9b076d5757be6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078588420304469?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078588420304469; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejvs.2020.05.024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM3LmNzdjs5ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674138,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"a3Mv7/B3\u002B62aCqqcai\u002BdOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_37.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IC","NPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergency interventions","number of patients","contamination of patients","elective activity","emergency phase","COVID","acute setting","maintenance of regular elective vascular surgery activity","vascular surgery unit","Surgical activity","NPS","IC resources","type of interventions","total number of interventions","possible infection of physicians","elective procedures","vascular surgeons","elective operations","unprotected contact infected cases","infected colleagues","dedicated protocol","post-operative IC","pandemic","periods","preventive screening protocol","necessary protective devices","minimal need","risk of contamination","serological evaluation","serological physician evaluations","symptoms","nasopharyngeal swabs","intensive care","priority criteria","impact","days","study","Conclusion","Methods","Abstract Objective","hospitalisation","Results"],"language":"en"},

PRRS was recognized in 1987 and within a few years became pandemic causing an estimated yearly $600,000 economic loss in the USA with comparative losses in most other countries. The causative agent is a single-stranded, positive-sense enveloped arterivirus (PRRSV) that infects macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Despite the discovery of PRRSV in 1991 and the publication of \u003E2,000 articles, the control of PRRS is problematic. Despite the large volume of literature on this disease, the cellular and molecular mechanisms describing how PRRSV dysregulates the host immune system are poorly understood. We know that PRRSV suppresses innate immunity and causes abnormal B cell proliferation and repertoire development, often lymphopenia and thymic atrophy. The PRRSV genome is highly diverse, rapidly evolving but amenable to the generation of many mutants and chimeric viruses for experimental studies. PRRSV only replicates in swine which adds to the experimental difficulty since no inbred well-defined animal models are available.

It can reconstruct epidemic history when surveillance epidemiology data are sparse, and can indicate transmission linkages among infections that may not otherwise be evident. However, a remaining challenge is to develop an analytical framework that can test hypotheses about the effect of environmental variables on pathogen spatial spread. Recent phylogeographic approaches can reconstruct the history of virus dispersal from sampled viral genomes and infer the locations of ancestral infections. Such methods provide a unique source of spatio-temporal information, and are exploited here. RESULTS: We present and apply a new statistical framework that combines genomic and geographic data to test the impact of environmental variables on the mode and tempo of pathogen dispersal during emerging epidemics. First, the spatial history of an emerging pathogen is estimated using standard phylogeographic methods. The inferred dispersal path for each phylogenetic lineage is then assigned a \u201Cweight\u201D using environmental data (e.g. altitude, land cover). Next, tests measure the association between each environmental variable and lineage movement. A randomisation procedure is used to assess statistical confidence and we validate this approach using simulated data. We apply our new framework to a set of gene sequences from an epidemic of rabies virus in North American raccoons. We test the impact of six different environmental variables on this epidemic and demonstrate that elevation is associated with a slower rabies spread in a natural population. CONCLUSION: This study shows that it is possible to integrate genomic and environmental data in order to test hypotheses concerning the mode and tempo of virus dispersal during emerging epidemics.

The reduction in infectivity was measured by p24 ELISA and compared to the effect of established anti-HIV drugs-azidothymidine (AZT) and dextran sulfate. The results indicate that low doses of bestatin (1 \u03BCg/ml) can completely inhibit viral infection resulting either from inoculation with free virus or coculture with infected lymphocytes. Unlike AZT or dextran sulfate, bestatin prevents HIV infection without interfering with the rate of cell growth. No appreciable decrease in HIV production was observed when chronically infected virus-producing T cell lines ie, H9, MOLT 4, HPB-ALL, 8E5 and MT -2 were treated with bestatin.

Given the fact that most existing models cannot comprehensively depict heterogeneities (e.g., the population heterogeneity and the distribution heterogeneity) and complex contagion patterns (which are mostly caused by the human interaction induced by modern transportation) in the real world, a theoretical model of the spread of infectious diseases is proposed. It employs geo-entity based cellular automata to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in a geographical environment. In the model, physical geographical regions are defined as cells. The population within each cell is divided into three classes: Susceptible, Infective, and Recovered, which are further divided into some subclasses by states of individuals. The transition rules, which determine the changes of proportions of those subclasses and reciprocal transformation formulas among them, are provided. Through defining suitable spatial weighting functions, the model is applied to simulate the spread of the infectious diseases with not only local contagion but also global contagion. With some cases of simulation, it has been shown that the results are reasonably consistent with the spread of infectious diseases in the real world. The model is supposed to model dynamics of infectious diseases on complex networks, which is nearly impossible to be achieved with differential equations because of the complexity of the problem. The cases of simulation also demonstrate that efforts of all kinds of interventions can be visualized and explored, and then the model is able to provide decision-making support for prevention and control of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2009-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, ShaoBo; Huang, QuanYi; Song, DunJiang","journal":"Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf30423d4b37babbcfc4a5ec5f86e32a703d97dd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-009-0044-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214747/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spread of infectious diseases","control of infectious diseases","dynamics of infectious diseases","theoretical model","local contagion","complex contagion patterns","real world","population heterogeneity","global contagion","subclasses","cases of simulation","distribution heterogeneity","complex networks","existing models","geographical environment","physical geographical regions","study of mathematical models","prevention","decision-making support","modern transportation","cellular automata","important issue","changes of proportions","efforts","suitable spatial weighting functions","heterogeneities","reciprocal transformation formulas","differential equations","complexity","geo-entity","human interaction","cells","epidemiology","transition rules","kinds of interventions","problem","states of individuals","fact","results"],"language":"en"},

A significant increase is expected in the number of imaging studies ordered for the initial diagnosis and treatment follow-up of cases of COVID-19. Here, we highlight recommendations for developing and implementing a mass casualty incident (MCI) plan for a viral outbreak, such as the current COVID-19 infection. The MCI plan consists of several steps, including preparation, mobilization of resources, imaging chain, adjusting imaging protocols, and education, such as MCI plan simulation and in-service training. Having an MCI plan in place for a viral outbreak will protect patients and staff and ultimately decrease virus transmission.

We conducted intensive sampling of bats from the phyllostomidae, vespertilionidae and emballonuridae families in six localities from Casanare department in eastern Colombia. Blood-EDTA samples were obtained and subsequently submitted to analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers in order to conduct barcoding analyses to discriminate trypanosome species. The findings according to the congruence of the three molecular markers suggest the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi cruzi (51%), T. c. marinkellei (9%), T. dionisii (13%), T. rangeli (21%), T. evansi (4%) and T. theileri (2%) among 107 positive bat specimens. Regarding the T. cruzi DTUs, we observed the presence of TcI (60%), TcII (15%), TcIII (7%), TcIV (7%) and TcBAT (11%) being the first evidence to our concern of the foreseen genotype TcBAT in Colombia.

The copy numbers for transcripts of TGEV and PEDV were quantified using this assay over a range from 9 \u00D7 10(7) to 9 \u00D7 10(1) copies and 7 \u00D7 10(7) to 7 \u00D7 10(1) copies, respectively.

In this paper we report the development of a recombination assay for coronavirus, using polymerase chain reaction, in the absence of selection pressure. Our results showed that within a 1-kb region of the peplomer gene, RNA recombination occurred at almost every potential crossover site. Thus, coronavirus RNA recombination appears to be more random than previously realized. However, after serial passages of the recombinant viruses in tissue culture, the recombination sites among the progeny viruses became clustered in the region which contains the previously reported \u201Chot spot\u201D for coronavirus recombination. These results suggest that RNA recombination is common and random in nature, but only certain recombinants can be selected. Thus, the presence of recombinational \u201Chot spots\u201D for coronavirus or other RNA viruses most likely resulted from selection of certain recombinant viruses and not restriction on the occurrence of RNA recombination. The failure to detect recombinants in other RNA viruses may therefore be due to unfavorable properties of recombinant viruses.

We demonstrated for the first time that in humans, [Pyr(1)]apelin-13 was cleaved from both termini but the C-terminal was more susceptible to cleavage. Consequently, of the metabolites identified, [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1\u201312)), [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1\u201310)) and [Pyr(1)]apelin-13((1\u20136)) were the most abundant. These data suggest that apelin peptides designed for use as cardiovascular therapeutics, should include modifications that minimise C-terminal cleavage.","publish_time":"2019-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nyimanu, Duuamene; Kay, Richard G.; Sulentic, Petra; Kuc, Rhoda E.; Ambery, Philip; Jermutus, Lutz; Reimann, Frank; Gribble, Fiona M.; Cheriyan, Joseph; Maguire, Janet J.; Davenport, Anthony P.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0b104ed7194e21c4ba47460db675b638b0d29bc4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6934825.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56157-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31882594/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pyr","apelin peptides","predominant apelin peptide isoform","MS method","human plasma","metabolites","humans","quantification of intact","reproducible method","LC-MS","minutes infusion","human cardiovascular system","C-terminal cleavage","studies","time","circulating concentration of intact peptide","healthy human volunteers","cardiovascular therapeutics","detection","modifications","rats","use","blood","presence of guanidine hydrochloride","stability","metabolism","termini","data","date","nmol"],"language":"en"},

The thermal flow of human body was imitated using a 3D thermal manikin with real body features, while a recent developed multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian approach was used to address the effects of inhomogeneous temperature and humidity fields on droplet evaporation. By comparing the results yielded without and with the human body heat, the outcomes demonstrated strong impact of human body heat on the droplets mass fraction and local air velocity distributions. Inspirable droplets could potentially drop into respirable droplets by evaporation, although the evaporation rate was not significantly affected by body heat. The thermal effect of human body revealed its vital impacts on the time-dependent droplets dispersion. Due to the buoyancy driven thermal flow, both the vertical velocity and displacement of small droplets (\u226420 \u03BCm) were completely reversed from descending to ascending, while the deposition time of large droplets (\u226550 \u03BCm) were significantly delayed. With the reduced droplet size by evaporation and droplets lifted into breathing zone by human thermal effect, the inhalability and infection risks of cough droplets would be much higher in real occupied indoor spaces.","publish_time":"2019-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yan, Yihuan; Li, Xiangdong; Tu, Jiyuan","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/851f1085f67a17527fa4145736c18fb1e487af75.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116917.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132318306644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287988/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.10.039; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132318306644","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["thermal effect of human body","thermal flow of human body","respirable droplets","Inspirable droplets","human thermal effect","time-dependent droplets dispersion","droplets mass fraction","displacement of small droplets","time-dependent dispersion of cough droplets","strong impact of human body heat","deposition time of large droplets","droplet evaporation","real body features","infection risks of cough droplets","evaporation process","evaporation rate","D thermal manikin","\u03BCm","vertical velocity","reduced droplet size","local air velocity distributions","real occupied indoor spaces","recent developed multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian approach","inhalability","outcomes","humidity fields","vital impacts","breathing zone","effects of inhomogeneous temperature","buoyancy","study","results"],"language":"en"},

To study disease pathogenesis and to develop efficient and safe therapies, the use of an appropriate animal model is a critical concern. Adult mice with gene knockouts of the interferon \u03B1/\u03B2 (IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2) receptor (IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212)) have been described as a model of arbovirus infections. Studies with the natural hosts of these viruses are limited by financial and ethical issues, and in some cases, the need to have facilities with a biosafety level 3 with sufficient space to accommodate large animals. Moreover, the number of animals in the experiments must provide results with statistical significance. Recent advances in animal models in the last decade among other gaps in knowledge have contributed to the better understanding of arbovirus infections. A tremendous advantage of the IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mouse model is the availability of a wide variety of reagents that can be used to study many aspects of the immune response to the virus. Although extrapolation of findings in mice to natural hosts must be done with care due to differences in the biology between mouse and humans, experimental infections of IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice with several studied arboviruses closely mimics hallmarks of these viruses in their natural host. Therefore, IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice are a good model to facilitate studies on arbovirus transmission, pathogenesis, virulence, and the protective efficacy of new vaccines. In this review article, the most important arboviruses that have been studied using the IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mouse model will be reviewed.","publish_time":"2019-01-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mar\u00EDn-Lopez, Alejandro; Calvo-Pinilla, Eva; Moreno, Sandra; Utrilla-Trigo, Sergio; Nogales, Aitor; Brun, Alejandro; Fikrig, Erol; Ortego, Javier","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c0c9617097af6391e34b3f30dde6c1e6845d722.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6356211.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11010035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625992/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouse model","model of arbovirus infections","good model","experimental infections of IFNAR","appropriate animal model","natural hosts","Adult mice","studied arboviruses","arbovirus transmission","better understanding of arbovirus infections","Studies","domestic animals","large animals","important arboviruses","number of animals","study disease pathogenesis","interferon \u03B1","IFN-\u03B1","animal models","gene knockouts","experiments","sufficient space","biology","virulence","availability","humans","constant threat","biosafety level","worldwide distribution","cases","knowledge","facilities","public health","safe therapies","decade","results","wildlife","care","critical concern","receptor","protective efficacy of new vaccines","hallmarks","ethical issues","extrapolation of findings","wide variety of reagents","immune response","statistical significance","need","Recent advances","review article","differences","aspects","gaps","plants","tremendous advantage"],"language":"en"},

The VGG met with numerous first opinion practitioners, small animal association leaders, academic veterinarians, government regulators and industry representatives and gathered further information from a survey of almost 700 veterinarians in India, China, Japan and Thailand. Although there were substantial differences in the nature and magnitude of the challenges faced by veterinarians in each country, and also differences in the resources available to meet those challenges, overall, the VGG identified insufficient undergraduate and postgraduate training in small companion animal microbiology, immunology and vaccinology. In most of the countries, there has been little academic research into small animal infectious diseases. This, coupled with insufficient laboratory diagnostic support, has limited the growth of knowledge concerning the prevalence and circulating strains of key infectious agents in most of the countries visited. Asian practitioners continue to recognise clinical infections that are now considered uncommon or rare in western countries. In particular, canine rabies virus infection poses a continuing threat to animal and human health in this region. Both nationally manufactured and international dog and cat vaccines are variably available in the Asian countries, but the product ranges are small and dominated by multi\u2010component vaccines with a licensed duration of immunity (DOI) of only 1 year, or no description of DOI. Asian practitioners are largely unaware of current global trends in small animal vaccinology or of the WSAVA vaccination guidelines. Consequently, most practitioners continue to deliver annual revaccination with both core and non\u2010core vaccines to adult animals, with little understanding that \u201Cherd immunity\u201D is more important than frequent revaccination of individual animals within the population. In this paper, the VGG presents the findings of this project and makes key recommendations for the Asian countries. The VGG recommends that (1) Asian veterinary schools review and increase as needed the amount of instruction in small animal vaccinology within their undergraduate curriculum and increase the availability of pertinent postgraduate education for practitioners; (2) national small animal veterinary associations, industry veterinarians and academic experts work together to improve the scientific evidence base concerning small animal infectious diseases and vaccination in their countries; (3) national small animal veterinary associations take leadership in providing advice to practitioners based on improved local knowledge and global vaccination guidelines; (4) licensing authorities use this enhanced evidence base to inform and support the registration of improved vaccine product ranges for use in their countries, ideally with DOI for core vaccines similar or equal to those of equivalent products available in western countries (i.e. 3 or 4 years). The VGG also endorses the efforts made by Asian governments, non\u2010governmental organisations and veterinary practitioners in working towards the goal of global elimination of canine rabies virus infection. In this paper, the VGG offers both a current pragmatic and future aspirational approach to small animal vaccination in Asia. As part of this project, the VGG delivered continuing education to over 800 Asian practitioners at seven events in four countries. Accompanying this document is a list of 80 frequently asked questions (with answers) that arose during these discussions. The VGG believes that this information will be of particular value to Asian veterinarians as they move towards implementing global trends in small companion animal vaccinology.","publish_time":"2014-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Day, M.

Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases than in mild cases of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Chao; Shi, Lei; Wang, Fu-Sheng","journal":"The Lancet Gastroenterology \u0026 Hepatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ce817b1fa3f295c44f1ec1bb1a93784cfa1ba4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129165.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468125320300571; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145190/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2468-1253(20)30057-1; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468125320300571","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Huang"],"organizations":["The Fifth Medical Center of PLS General Hospital","AST","ICU","CT"],"locations":["Middle East","Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["non-severe patients","severe COVID","clinical features of patients","severe cases","liver injury","liver comorbidities","Liver impairment","abnormal liver aminotransferase levels","severe respiratory symptoms","MERS-CoV","SARS-CoV","mild cases of COVID","diagnosis of COVID","higher rates of liver dysfunction","aspartate aminotransferase","abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase","disease progression","elevation of AST","data","onset of symptoms","ICU","study","genome sequence homology","genome sequence similarity","large-scale case studies","available case studies","lower incidence of AST abnormality","symptom onset","intensive care unit","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Medical Center of PLS General Hospital","provincial municipalities","Beijing","hospitals","shares","provinces","subclinical phase","China","Huang","colleagues","CT scan","Lancet","table","coronaviruses","large cohort","Comment","SARS3"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are significant causes of seasonal respiratory illness in children. The incidence of influenza and RSV hospitalization is well documented, but the incidence of medically attended, laboratory-confirmed illness has not been assessed in a well defined community cohort. Methods. Children aged 6\u201359 months with medically attended acute respiratory illness were prospectively enrolled during the 2006\u20132007 through 2009\u20132010 influenza seasons in a Wisconsin community cohort. Nasal swabs were tested for RSV and influenza by multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The population incidence of medically attended RSV and influenza was estimated separately and standardized to weeks 40 through 18 of each season. Results. The cohort included 2800\u20133073 children each season. There were 2384 children enrolled with acute respiratory illness; 627 (26%) were positive for RSV and 314 (13%) for influenza. The mean age was 28 months (standard deviation [SD] = 15) for RSV-positive and 38 months (SD = 16) for influenza-positive children. Seasonal incidence (cases per 10 000) was 1718 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1602\u20131843) for RSV and 768 (95% CI, 696\u2013848) for influenza.

In the current study, we first examined the efficacy of UDA on the replication of different SARS-CoV strains in Vero 76 cells. UDA inhibited virus replication in a dose-dependent manner and reduced virus yields of the Urbani strain by 90% at 1.1 \u00B1 0.4 \u00B5g/ml in Vero 76 cells. Then, UDA was tested for efficacy in a lethal SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mouse model. BALB/c mice were infected with two LD(50) (575 PFU) of virus for 4 hours before the mice were treated intraperitoneally with UDA at 20, 10, 5 or 0 mg/kg/day for 4 days. Treatment with UDA at 5 mg/kg significantly protected the mice against a lethal infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (p\u003C0.001), but did not significantly reduce virus lung titers. All virus-infected mice receiving UDA treatments were also significantly protected against weight loss (p\u003C0.001). UDA also effectively reduced lung pathology scores. At day 6 after virus exposure, all groups of mice receiving UDA had much lower lung weights than did the placebo-treated mice. Thus, our data suggest that UDA treatment of SARS infection in mice leads to a substantial therapeutic effect that protects mice against death and weight loss. Furthermore, the mode of action of UDA in vitro was further investigated using live SARS-CoV Urbani strain virus and retroviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike (S). UDA specifically inhibited the replication of live SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus when added just before, but not after, adsorption. These data suggested that UDA likely inhibits SARS-CoV infection by targeting early stages of the replication cycle, namely, adsorption or penetration. In addition, we demonstrated that UDA neutralizes the virus infectivity, presumably by binding to the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein. Finally, the target molecule for inhibition of virus replication was partially characterized. When UDA was exposed to N-acetylglucosamine and then UDA was added to cells just prior to adsorption, UDA did not inhibit the virus infection. These data support the conclusion that UDA might bind to N-acetylglucosamine-like residues present on the glycosylated envelope glycoproteins, thereby preventing virus attachment to cells.","publish_time":"2011-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumaki, Yohichi; Wandersee, Miles K.; Smith, Aaron J.; Zhou, Yanchen; Simmons, Graham; Nelson, Nathan M.; Bailey, Kevin W.; Vest, Zachary G.; Li, Joseph K.-K.; Chan, Paul Kay-Sheung; Smee, Donald F.; Barnard, Dale L.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50f49066ac3c00aa636bb837101f9a6715aae740.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e5ad25c31b95198c3994a9bf4c7268cfc066c7b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3085190.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211000313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21338626/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.02.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211000313","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Urtica"],"organizations":["Vero","SARS","UDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficacy of UDA","UDA treatments","UDA inhibited virus replication","UDA treatment of SARS infection","SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus","virus infection","SARS-CoV infection","virus-infected mice","lethal SARS-CoV","SARS-CoV spike","reduced virus","replication of live SARS-CoV","virus attachment","virus exposure","virus infectivity","live SARS-CoV Urbani strain virus","inhibition of virus replication","mouse-adapted SARS-CoV","virus lung titers","replication of different SARS-CoV strains","c mice","groups of mice","cells","placebo-treated mice","replication cycle","lethal infection","data","adsorption","infected BALB","N-acetylglucosamine specificity","Vero","weight loss","reduced lung pathology scores","c mouse model","lower lung weights","retroviral particles","kDa","dose-dependent manner","residues present","glycosylated envelope glycoproteins","small plant monomeric lectin","early stages","size","death","substantial therapeutic effect","binding","viruses","target molecule","Urtica dioica agglutinin","Nidovirales","PFU","LD","hours","conclusion","penetration","\u00B5g","mode of action","current study","days","addition"],"language":"en"},

Infection of RGNNV redistributed NPM1, stabilized p53 and inhibited cell proliferation by inducing G1 arrest. RGNNV infection also led to phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, RGNNV infection upregulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A (p21) and downregulated cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). The expression of genes in the p53 pathway did not change significantly after p53 knockdown by pifithrin-\u03B1 during RGNNV infection. However, NPM1 knockdown could abrogate RGNNV-induced cell proliferation inhibition, activation of p53 signaling and cell cycle arrest. In addition, RGNNV infection of the cells synchronized in various stages of cell cycle showed that viral genomic RNA and virus titer were higher in the cells released from G1 phase- or S phase-synchronized cells than that in the cells released from the G2 phase-synchronized or asynchronous cells after 18 h p.i.

In recent years, the cellular distribution and biological functions of FPRs have expanded to include additional roles in homeostasis of organ functions and modulation of inflammation. In a prototype, FPRs recognize peptides containing N-formylated methionine such as those produced in bacteria and mitochondria, thereby serving as pattern recognition receptors. The repertoire of FPR ligands, however, has expanded rapidly to include not only N-formyl peptides from microbes but also non-formyl peptides of microbial and host origins, synthetic small molecules and an eicosanoid. How these chemically diverse ligands are recognized by the three human FPRs (FPR1, FPR2 and FPR3) and their murine equivalents is largely unclear. In the absence of crystal structures for the FPRs, site-directed mutagenesis, computer-aided ligand docking and structural simulation have led to the identification of amino acids within FPR1 and FPR2 that interact with several formyl peptides. This review article summarizes the progress made in the understanding of FPR ligand diversity as well as ligand recognition mechanisms used by these receptors.","publish_time":"2017-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Hui-Qiong; Ye, Richard D.","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c7ee2062b49226bfee08114f12cb1cd07509d9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6155412.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules22030455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28335409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human FPRs","formyl peptide receptors","biological functions of FPRs","non-formyl peptides of microbial","pattern recognition receptors","FPR2","ligand recognition mechanisms","FPR1","understanding of FPR ligand diversity","computer-aided ligand","repertoire of FPR ligands","host origins","diverse ligands","mediate host-defense","homeostasis of organ functions","N-formylated methionine","migration","phagocytes","cellular distribution","synthetic small molecules","microbes","granule release","cell adhesion","chemotactic signals","inflammatory responses","site","additional roles","mutagenesis","FPR3","G protein","structural simulation","identification of amino acids","superoxide production","progress","absence of crystal structures","recent years","murine equivalents","modulation of inflammation","eicosanoid","mitochondria","prototype","review article","bacteria"],"language":"en"},

Data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 are limited. Objective The severity on admission, complications, treatment, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients were evaluated. Methods Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital from January 26, 2020 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and followed-up until March 3, 2020. Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients. Results We identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission. Elder age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a), and high LDH level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. The prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 patients was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan. The estimated mortality was 1.1% in nonsevere patients and 32.5% in severe cases during the average 32 days of follow-up period. Survival analysis revealed that male, elder age, leukocytosis, high LDH level, cardiac injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use were associated with death in patients with severe COVID-19. Conclusions Patients with elder age, hypertension, and high LDH level need careful observation and early intervention to prevent the potential development of severe COVID-19. Severe male patients with heart injury, hyperglycemia, and high-dose corticosteroid use may have high risk of death.","publish_time":"2020-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xiaochen; Xu, Shuyun; Yu, Muqing; Wang, Ke; Tao, Yu; Zhou, Ying; Shi, Jing; Zhou, Min; Wu, Bo; Yang, Zhenyu; Zhang, Cong; Yue, Junqing; Zhang, Zhiguo; Renz, Harald; Liu, Xiansheng; Xie, Jungang; Xie, Min; Zhao, Jianping","journal":"J Allergy Clin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a87913336d15af51143dda9b56b9cebe5a95a871.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920304954?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294485/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920304954","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Severe male patients","outcomes of patients","outcomes of COVID","severe cases","nonsevere patients","Conclusions Patients","Methods Patients","potential development of severe COVID","high LDH level","high risk of death","high-dose corticosteroid use","high cytokine levels","Elder age","IL","admission","hyperglycemia","survival analysis","Potential risk factors","underlying hypertension","cardiac injury","heart injury","adult population of Wuhan","multivariable binary logistic model","Cox proportional hazard regression model","leukocytosis","early intervention","careful observation","complications","average","treatment","clinical characteristics","severity","days of follow-up period","Data","Objective","estimated mortality","prevalence of asthma","Abstract Background","Tongji Hospital","outbreak","TNF"],"language":"en"},

To deeply reveal the interaction of host and SARS-CoV, based on the basic structural feature of pathogen-associated molecular pattern, we created a new bioinformatics method for searching potential pathogenic molecules and identified a set of SARS-CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA fragments with a high-density distribution in the genome. In vitro experiments, the result showed the representative SARS-CoV ssRNAs had powerful immunostimulatory activities to induce considerable level of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12 release via the TLR7 and TLR8, almost 2-fold higher than the strong stimulatory ssRNA40 that was found previously from other virus. Moreover, SARS-CoV ssRNA was able to cause acute lung injury in mice with a high mortality rate in vivo experiment. It suggests that SARS-CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA plays a very important role in the cytokine storm associated with a dysregulation of the innate immunity. This study not only presents new evidence about the immunopathologic damage caused by overactive inflammation during the SARS-CoV infection, but also provides a useful clue for a new therapeutic strategy.","publish_time":"2013-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yan; Chen, Ming; Cao, Hongwei; Zhu, Yuanfeng; Zheng, Jiang; Zhou, Hong","journal":"Microbes and Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b3a1f73215b2c0ff5dfe585325ef8d9de79da1c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110875.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457912002572; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457912002572; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2012.10.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23123977/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","set of SARS","representative SARS-CoV ssRNAs","SARS-CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA","CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA fragments","new evidence","dangerous cytokine storm","IL","new bioinformatics method","new therapeutic strategy","inflammatory cytokine TNF","considerable level of","powerful immunostimulatory activities","mice","acute lung injury","potential pathogenic molecules","overactive inflammation","aspects","high mortality rate","molecular pattern","immunopathologic damage","high-density distribution","important role","basic structural feature of pathogen","useful clue","pathogenetic mechanism","dysregulation","result","strong stimulatory ssRNA40","TLR8","outbreak","release","TLR7","immune disorder","interaction of host","innate immunity","genome","experiments","study","virus"],"language":"en"},

As of 18 March 2020, a total number of 194909 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 7876 deaths, the majority of which have been reported in China (3242) and Italy (2505)(3). However, as the pandemic is still unfortunately under progression, there are limited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as to their prognostic factors(4). Smoking, to date, has been assumed to be possibly associated with adverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with a plethora of respiratory diseases(5). Smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases(6). Previous studies have shown that smokers are twice more likely than non-smokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms, while smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous MERS-CoV outbreak(7,8). Given the gap in the evidence, we conducted a systematic review of studies on COVID-19 that included information on patients\u2019 smoking status to evaluate the association between smoking and COVID-19 outcomes including the severity of the disease, the need for mechanical ventilation, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization and death. The literature search was conducted on 17 March 2020, using two databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect), with the search terms: [\u2018smoking\u2019 OR \u2018tobacco\u2019 OR \u2018risk factors\u2019 OR \u2018smoker*\u2019] AND [\u2018COVID-19\u2019 OR \u2018COVID 19\u2019 OR \u2018novel coronavirus\u2019 OR \u2018sars cov-2\u2019 OR \u2018sars cov 2\u2019] and included studies published in 2019 and 2020. Further inclusion criteria were that the studies were in English and referred to humans. We also searched the reference lists of the studies included. A total of 71 studies were retrieved through the search, of which 66 were excluded after full-text screening, leaving five studies that were included. All of the studies were conducted in China, four in Wuhan and one across provinces in mainland China. The populations in all studies were patients with COVID-19, and the sample size ranged from 41 to 1099 patients. With regard to the study design, retrospective and prospective methods were used, and the timeframe of all five studies covered the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019, January 2020). Specifically, Zhou et al.(9) studied the epidemiological characteristics of 191 individuals infected with COVID-19, without, however, reporting in more detail the mortality risk factors and the clinical outcomes of the disease. Among the 191 patients, there were 54 deaths, while 137 survived. Among those that died, 9% were current smokers compared to 4% among those that survived, with no statistically significant difference between the smoking rates of survivors and non-survivors (p=0.21) with regard to mortality from COVID-19. Similarly, Zhang et al.(10) presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with COVID-19. The results showed that among severe patients (n=58), 3.4% were current smokers and 6.9% were former smokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n=82) among which 0% were current smokers and 3.7% were former smokers , leading to an OR of 2.23; (95% CI: 0.65\u20137.63; p=0.2). Huang et al.(11) studied the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 among 41 patients. In this study, none of those who needed to be admitted to an ICU (n=13) was a current smoker. In contrast, three patients from the non-ICU group were current smokers, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients (p=0.31), albeit the small sample size of the study. The largest study population of 1099 patients with COVID-19 was provided by Guan et al.(12) from multiple regions of mainland China. Descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients, of which 173 had severe symptoms, and 926 had non-severe symptoms. Among the patients with severe symptoms, 16.9% were current smokers and 5.2% were former smokers, in contrast to patients with non-severe symptoms where 11.8% were current smokers and 1.3% were former smokers. Additionally, in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU or died, 25.5% were current smokers and 7.6% were former smokers. In contrast, in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes, only 11.8% were current smokers and 1.6% were former smokers. No statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study. Finally, Liu et al.(13) found among their population of 78 patients with COVID-19 that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking (27.3%) than the group that showed improvement or stabilization (3.0%), with this difference statistically significant at the p=0.018 level. In their multivariate logistic regression analysis, the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression (OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58\u201325.00; p= 0.018). We identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with COVID-19. Notably, in the largest study that assessed severity, there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases(12). However, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 0.98\u20132.00) to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (RR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.43\u20134.04). In conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vardavas, Constantine I.; Nikitara, Katerina","journal":"Tob Induc Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4bde74efeb547d3d6d3f935482a80c9d456198f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.18332/tid/119324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32206052/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Zhou","Huang"],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["current smokers","cases of COVID","epidemiological characteristics of COVID","Previous studies","groups of patients","non-severe patients","systematic review of studies","clinical characteristics","smoking rates of survivors","regard","pandemic","patients\u2019 smoking status","non-survivors","clinical outcomes","sars cov","mainland China","non-ICU group","mortality risk factors","need","Wuhan","significant difference","higher mortality","previous MERS-CoV outbreak","severe symptoms","study design","contrast","coronavirus outbreak","search terms","literature search","deaths","adverse disease prognosis","small sample size","causal association","extensive evidence","novel coronavirus","risk factors\u2019","infectious diseases","prognostic factors","total number","plethora of respiratory diseases","negative impact of tobacco use","lung health","intensive care unit","mechanical ventilation","hospitalization","infections","immune system","prospective methods","limited data","ScienceDirect","influenza","responsiveness","information","severity","progression","non-smokers","Hubei Province","provinces","individuals","months","databases","PubMed","English","inclusion criteria","reference lists","text screening","timeframe","results","populations","humans","majority","gap","Zhang","Italy","date","Zhou","Huang","group of patients","smoking status of patients","severe symptoms of COVID","higher proportion of patients","higher percentage of smokers","non-severe symptoms","history of smoking","severe cases","adverse outcomes of COVID","higher percentages of current","adverse outcome group","disease outcome","largest study population","risk factor of disease progression","ICU support","negative progression","published data","times","limited available data","Descriptive results","statistical analysis","multivariate logistic regression analysis","association","factors","multiple regions of mainland China","evidence","admission","research","weight","difference","level","improvement","stabilization","Guan","studies","conclusion","Liu"],"language":"en"},

Although fatalities were not observed, SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed virus in nasal washes, saliva, urine, and feces up to 8 days post-infection. At 2 days post-contact, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all naive direct contact ferrets. Furthermore, a few naive indirect contact ferrets were positive for viral RNA, suggesting airborne transmission.

Health indicators in the EMR are among the worst in the world.6 State fragility and conflict are among the biggest challenges to attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3.7 Conflict is a global health security threat because affected countries are less able to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks. More than 70% of disease outbreaks worldwide occur in fragile and conflict-affected settings.8 Yemen has experienced the largest cholera outbreak in history.9 During the second half of 2019, there were six concurrent disease outbreaks in Sudan.10 Wild polio virus returned to Syria due to conflict,11 while Afghanistan and Pakistan are two of three countries where the virus remains endemic.12 The average International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity score is much lower for the 12 conflict-affected countries than for the other countries in the region,6 placing them at greater risk of spread and public health consequences of the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other epidemic-prone diseases.

Host epithelial cells are specially enriched for pattern recognition receptors that activate immune response genes to limit viral replication. A prominently expressed set of these genes encodes cytokines that orchestrate key aspects of host defense, such as recruitment of immune cells and repair of epithelial cell damage. Under some circumstances, airway epithelial cells may be programmed to release cytokines (notably IL-33) that activate a type 2 immune response, which in excess might contribute to the development of chronic obstructive lung disease. Moreover, long-term epithelial progenitor cells with this capability may explain an ongoing susceptibility to lung disease in response to acute respiratory infection or other types of inhaled danger signals. The mucosal airway epithelial cell can thereby mediate a beneficial response for host defense and a detrimental response leading to inflammatory disease.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alexander-Brett, Jennifer; Holtzman, Michael J.","journal":"Mucosal Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6bd56e2c81b2466421eaab75e33132c2525c11a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150047.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124158474000537; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124158474000537","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Host epithelial cells","airway epithelial cells","immune response genes","airway epithelial cell barrier","mucosal airway epithelial cell","detrimental response","beneficial response","long-term epithelial progenitor cells","repair of epithelial cell damage","recruitment of immune cells","key aspects of host defense","inflammatory disease","line of defense","cytokines","common respiratory viruses","development of chronic obstructive lung disease","viral replication","acute respiratory infection","main site of replication","pattern recognition receptors","capability","ongoing susceptibility","types of inhaled danger signals","excess","circumstances","set"],"language":"en"},

In Egypt and the Middle East region, there is a lack of data regarding the viral causes of LRTI. In this study, we aimed to identify the relative prevalence of various respiratory viruses that contribute to LRTIs in young children. Although, nucleic acid-based methods have gained importance as a sensitive tool to determine the viral infections, their use is limited because of their prohibitive cost in low-income countries. Therefore, we applied three different laboratory methods, and presented the different virus prevalence patterns detected by each method. METHODS: We collected nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, demographic data and, clinical data from 450 children under five years of age who presented with LRTI at Abou El Reesh hospital in Cairo during a one-year period. To identify the viral causes of the LRTI we used direct fluorescence assay, real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-RT-PCR), and shell vial culture. We tested for eight major respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-nine patients (59.9%) had a viral infection, among which 10.8% had a co-infection with two or more viruses. By all three methods, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most predominant, and parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV-2), influenza B virus (FLUBV) were the least predominant. Other viral prevalence patterns differed according to the detection method used. The distribution of various viruses among different age groups and seasonal distribution of the viruses were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: RSV and human adenovirus were the most common respiratory viruses detected by rt-RT-PCR. Co-infections were found to be frequent among children and the vast majority of co-infections were detected by nucleic acid-based detection assays.","publish_time":"2012-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shafik, Caroline F; Mohareb, Emad W; Yassin, Aymen S; Amin, Madgy A; El Kholy, Amani; El-Karaksy, Hanaa; Youssef, Fouad G","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25d4af008525a27cff170cac5381937b1a65dc83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3538156.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23237512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI"],"locations":["Middle East","Cairo"],"keyphrases":["viral infections","rt-RT","common respiratory viruses","major respiratory viruses","viral causes of LRTI","relative prevalence of various respiratory viruses","distribution of various viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","viral prevalence patterns","different virus prevalence patterns","Lower respiratory tract infections","different laboratory methods","nucleic acid-based methods","young children","vast majority of co-infections","demographic data","different age groups","lack of data","clinical data","influenza B virus","parainfluenza virus type","RSV","PCR","detection method","nucleic acid-based detection assays","years of age","seasonal distribution","low-income countries","developing countries","real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","direct fluorescence assay","human adenovirus","nasopharyngeal aspirate samples","Cairo","HPIV","Abou","importance","LRTIs","considerable number of deaths","sensitive tool","prohibitive cost","Reesh hospital","FLUBV","BACKGROUND","Middle East region","shell vial culture","Egypt","CONCLUSIONS","year period","RESULTS","patients","study"],"language":"en"},

Laboratory PCR is accurate but takes at least 24 h to generate a result to clinicians and antigen-based point-of-care tests (POCT) lack sensitivity. Rapid molecular platforms, such as the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, have equivalent diagnostic accuracy to laboratory PCR and can generate a result in 1 h making them deployable as POCT. Molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in hospital has the potential to improve the detection rate of respiratory viruses, improve the use of influenza antivirals and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, but high quality randomised trials with clinically relevant endpoints are needed. METHODS: The ResPOC study is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in adults with acute respiratory illness presenting to a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Eligible participants are adults presenting with acute respiratory illness to the emergency department or the acute medicine unit. Participants are allocated 1:1 by internet-based randomisation service to either the intervention of a nose and throat swab analysed immediately on the FilmArray Respiratory Panel as a POCT or receive routine clinical care. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics. Secondary outcomes include turnaround time, virus detection, neuraminidase inhibitor use, length of hospital stay and side room use. Analysis of the primary outcome will be by intention-to-treat and all enrolled participants will be included in safety analysis. DISCUSSION: Multiple novel molecular POCT platforms for infections including respiratory viruses have been developed and licensed in the last few years and many more are in development but the evidence base for clinical benefit above standard practice is minimal. This randomised controlled trial aims to close this evidence gap by generating high quality evidence for the clinical impact of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses in secondary care and to act as an exemplar for future studies of molecular POCT for infections. This study has the potential to change practice and improve patient care for patients presenting to hospital with acute respiratory illness.

Air-exchange rate measurements were performed in each room using CO2 as a tracer. The model developed by Gammaitoni and Nucci was used to estimate infection risk. Results Current outdoor air-exchange rates in the lung function laboratory and emergency department isolation room limited infection risks to 0.1%-3.6%. Influenza risk for individuals entering an outpatient consultation room after an infectious individual departed ranged from 3.6% to 20.7%, depending on the duration for which each person occupied the room.

Several components of the host immune responses have been shown to contribute to the UGT pathology following genital chlamydial infection. We have shown recently that CD8(\u002B) T cells induce the chlamydial UGT pathology via the production of TNF-\u03B1. However, those studies did not determine whether the pathology is mediated by bystander or antigen-specific CD8(\u002B) T cells.

All CD8(\u002B) T cells in the OT-1 mice respond only to the Ova 257\u2013264 peptide and are incapable of responding to other antigenic epitopes including those of Chlamydia. OT-1 mice displayed vaginal chlamydial clearance comparable to the wild type animals. However, both oviduct and uterine horn pathology were minimal in the OT-1 mice compared to the high degree of pathology observed in the wild type animals.

FIV infection causes AIDS-like disease and mortality in the domestic cat (Felis catus) and serves as a natural model for HIV infection in humans. In African lions (Panthera leo) and other exotic felid species, disease etiology introduced by FIV infection are less clear, but recent studies indicate that FIV causes moderate to severe CD4 depletion. RESULTS: In this study, comparative genomic methods are used to evaluate the full proviral genome of two geographically distinct FIV subtypes isolated from free-ranging lions. Genome organization of FIV(Ple )subtype B (9891 bp) from lions in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania and FIV(Ple )subtype E (9899 bp) isolated from lions in the Okavango Delta in Botswana, both resemble FIV genome sequence from puma, Pallas cat and domestic cat across 5\u0027 LTR, gag, pol, vif, orfA, env, rev and 3\u0027LTR regions. Comparative analyses of available full-length FIV consisting of subtypes A, B and C from FIV(Fca), Pallas cat FIV(Oma )and two puma FIV(Pco )subtypes A and B recapitulate the species-specific monophyly of FIV marked by high levels of genetic diversity both within and between species. Across all FIV(Ple )gene regions except env, lion subtypes B and E are monophyletic, and marginally more similar to Pallas cat FIV(Oma )than to other FIV. Sequence analyses indicate the SU and TM regions of env vary substantially between subtypes, with FIV(Ple )subtype E more related to domestic cat FIV(Fca )than to FIV(Ple) subtype B and FIV(Oma )likely reflecting recombination between strains in the wild. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the necessity of whole-genome analysis to complement population/gene-based studies, which are of limited utility in uncovering complex events such as recombination that may lead to functional differences in virulence and pathogenicity. These full-length lion lentiviruses are integral to the advancement of comparative genomics of human pathogens, as well as emerging disease in wild populations of endangered species.","publish_time":"2008-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pecon-Slattery, Jill; McCracken, Carrie L; Troyer, Jennifer L; VandeWoude, Sue; Roelke, Melody; Sondgeroth, Kerry; Winterbach, Christiaan; Winterbach, Hanlie; O\u0027Brien, Stephen J","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb4e468f68974db552de7a9f4e41d95607b0c461.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2270836.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18251995/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-9-66","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pallas"],"organizations":["FIV","Serengeti National Park","SU"],"locations":["Tanzania","Okavango Delta","Botswana"],"keyphrases":["FIV infection","puma FIV","domestic cat FIV","Pallas cat FIV","distinct FIV subtypes","FIV genome sequence","Genome organization of FIV","species-specific monophyly of FIV","Comparative analyses of available full-length FIV","subtype B","lion subtypes B","multiple species of cat","subtype E","Oma","gene regions","LTR regions","genome analysis","proviral genome","African lions","TM regions of env","emerging disease","disease etiology","Fca","exotic felid species","bp","Sequence analyses","wild populations of endangered species","human immunodeficiency virus","HIV infection","humans","study","gene-based studies","full-length lion lentiviruses","Feline immunodeficiency virus","comparative genomic methods","advancement of comparative genomics of human pathogens","recent studies","likely reflecting recombination","vif","Tanzania","Botswana","Serengeti National Park","Panthera leo","orfA","pol","high levels of genetic diversity","gag","strains","rev","mortality","limited utility","natural model","functional differences","complex events","necessity","severe CD4 depletion","Felis catus","BACKGROUND","AIDS","Pco","Okavango Delta","virulence","pathogenicity","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Clinical features and outcome A 33-year-old man with a history of heart failure developed pneumonia during hospitalization. After the standard antibiotic therapy for 3 days, he continued to experience persistent fever and progressive cough with purulent sputum. Broad spectrum antibiotics did not relieve the fever or the purulent sputum; therefore, the patient requested TCM for integrated therapy, and was subsequently treated with a regiment of \u201Cclearing heat and damp excreting\u201D decoction according to TCM theory. After three days of TCM combination therapy, the pneumonia patches significantly improved on chest X-ray. His sputum was obviously decreased in amount and the fever was complete remission in the 5th day of TCM adjuvant therapy. Conclusion Integrated therapy with a \u201Cclearing heat and damp excreting\u201D decoction may have improved hospital-acquired pneumonia in a patient comorbid with congestive heart failure. The anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory, antitussive and diuretic effects of TCM may be responsible for the observed improvement.

In these cultures glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is one of the most frequently used drugs. However, only in 21-st century a novel unusual property of the GA to enhance the activity of other drugs has been discovered. The review describes briefly the experimental evidences of wide spectrum of own biological activities of glycyrrhizic acid as well as discusses the possible mechanisms of the ability of GA to enhance the activity of other drugs. We have shown that due to its amphiphilic nature GA is able to form self-associates in aqueous and non-aqueous media, as well as water soluble complexes with a wide range of lipophilic drugs. The main purpose of our review is to focus reader\u0027s attention on physicochemical studies of the molecular mechanisms of GA activity as a drug delivery system (DDS). In our opinion, the most intriguing feature of glycyrrhizic acid which might be the key factor in its therapeutic activity is the ability of GA to incorporate into the lipid bilayer and to increase the membrane fluidity and permeability. The ability of biomolecules and their aggregates to change the properties of cell membranes is of great significance, from both fundamental and practical points of view.","publish_time":"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Selyutina, O.Yu.; Polyakov, N.

In this study, we aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of older patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective investigation of hospitalized older patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1, 2020, to February 10, 2020. RESULTS: In total, 203 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with a median age of 54 years (interquartile range, 41-68; range, 20-91 years). Men accounted for 108 (53.2%) of the cases, and 55 patients (27.1%) were \u003E65 years of age. Among patients who were 65 years and older, the mortality rate was 34.5% (19/55), which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at 4.7% (7/148). Common symptoms of older patients with COVID-19 included fever (94.5%; n=52), dry cough (69.1%; n=38), and chest distress (63.6%; n=35). Compared with young patients, older patients had more laboratory abnormalities and comorbidities. Through a multivariate analysis of the causes of death in older patients, we found that males, comorbidities, time from disease onset to hospitalization, abnormal kidney function, and elevated procalcitonin levels were all significantly associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: In the recent outbreak of COVID-19, our local hospital in Wuhan found that patients aged 65 and older had greater initial comorbidities, more severe symptoms, and were more likely to experience multi-organ involvement and death, as compared with younger patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, TieLong; Dai, Zhe; Mo, Pingzheng; Li, Xinyu; Ma, Zhiyong; Song, Shihui; Chen, Xiaoping; Luo, Mingqi; Liang, Ke; Gao, Shicheng; Zhang, Yongxi; Deng, Liping; Xiong, Yong","journal":"J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9a18334e2c1e7eca6cedf5ccd0abfbdfcaa8187.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32279081/; https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaa089","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["younger patients","outcomes of older patients","young patients","Common symptoms of older patients","retrospective investigation of hospitalized older patients","confirmed COVID","years of age","recent outbreak of COVID","causes of death","Wuhan city","Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University","greater initial comorbidities","disease onset","severe symptoms","local hospital","coronavirus disease","interquartile range","median age","abnormal kidney function","hospitalization","elevated procalcitonin levels","time","males","included fever","laboratory abnormalities","multi-organ involvement","clinical course","China","multivariate analysis","dry cough","mortality rate","chest distress","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS","total","world","cases","BACKGROUND","study"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there is no effective treatment for PRRSV and PEDV, and commercial vaccines do not induce sterilizing immunity. In this study, we screened a library of 1000 compounds and identified two specific inhibitors, designated compounds 2 and 3, which target the PRRSV 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP). First, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of compounds 2 and 3 on PRRSV 3CLSP activity. Next, we determined the anti-PRRSV capacity of compounds 2 and 3 in MARC-145 cells and obtained EC50 and CC50 values of 57\u03BCM (CC50 =479.9\u03BCM) and 56.8\u03BCM (CC50 =482.8\u03BCM), respectively.

Finally, our results indicated that the active sites (His39 in 3CLSP and His41 in 3CL protease) were conservative, and contacted compounds 2 and 3 via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces in the putative substrate-binding models.

These results suggest that antioxidants like NAC represent a potential additional treatment option that could be considered in the case of an influenza A virus pandemic.","publish_time":"2014-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Rui-Hua; Li, Chun-Hong; Wang, Cun-Lian; Xu, Ming-Ju; Xu, Tong; Wei, Dong; Liu, Bao-Jian; Wang, Guo-Hua; Tian, Shu-Fei","journal":"Int Immunopharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfd6929d639165551c24457213414d8a52f2c472.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106131.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576914002276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24968347/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576914002276; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2014.06.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs1OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAC","BALF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of NAC","NAC treatments","H9N2 swine influenza virus-infected mice","TLR4 mRNA","virus pandemic","viruses","c mice","replication of seasonal human influenza","levels of TLR4 protein","Pharmacological inhibitors of TLR4","pulmonary edema","pulmonary inflammation","similar effects","ALI model","MPO activity","neutrophils","total cells","macrophages","acute lung injury","TNF-\u03B1","E5564","potential additional treatment option","tissue culture infective doses","TCID","antioxidants","antioxidant N-acetyl","CXCL","lungs","BALF","cysteine","case","BALB","results","HeBei","data"],"language":"en"},

Their contribution to rubella virus (RV)-induced apoptosis was addressed through time-specific evaluation of characteristic parameters such as permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent release of the pro-apoptotic proteins apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and cytochrome c from mitochondria. Additionally, expression and localization pattern of p53 and selected members of the multifunctional and stress-inducible cyclophilin family were examined. The application of pifithrin \u03BC as an inhibitor of p53 shuttling to mitochondria reduced RV-induced cell death to an extent similar to that of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (benzyloxycarbonyl-V-A-D-(OMe)-fmk). However, RV progeny generation was not altered. This indicates that, despite an increased survival rate of its cellular host, induction of apoptosis neither supports nor restricts RV replication. Moreover, some of the examined apoptotic markers were affected in a strain-specific manner and differed between the cell culture-adapted strains: Therien and the HPV77 vaccine on the one hand, and a clinical isolate on the other. In summary, the results presented indicate that the transcription-independent mitochondrial p53 program contributes to RV-induced apoptosis.","publish_time":"2015-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Claus, Claudia; Manssen, Lena; H\u00FCbner, Denise; Ro\u00DFmark, Sarah; Bothe, Viktoria; Petzold, Alice; Gro\u00DFe, Claudia; Reins, Mareen; Mankertz, Annette; Frey, Teryl K.; Liebert, Uwe G.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64c59c6ee1a8693c4bc296bf844047426f046e1b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4690853.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26703711/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v7122928","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RV-induced apoptosis","RV replication","RV-induced cell death","induction of apoptosis","inhibitor of p53 shuttling","RV progeny generation","pro-apoptotic proteins apoptosis","localization pattern of p53","fmk","examined apoptotic markers","transcription-independent mitochondrial p53 program","intrinsic apoptotic cascade","mitochondrial membrane","strain-specific manner","cell culture-adapted strains","time-specific evaluation of characteristic parameters","broad spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD","factor","subsequent release","Therien","permeabilization","cellular host","selected members","AIF","extent similar","execution","HPV77 vaccine","stress-inducible cyclophilin family","benzyloxycarbonyl-V","increased survival rate","rubella virus","hand","cytochrome c","application of pifithrin \u03BC","pathways","expression","contribution","clinical isolate","results","summary"],"language":"en"},

RSV is classified into two subtypes, A and B, whose predominance alternates during different epidemic seasons. The clinical impact of viral factors is controversial and many evidences suggest a critical role for the immune host response. Premature children are at the highest risk for severe RSV infection. The main aim of this study is to identify the different RSV subtypes circulating in the last three epidemic seasons and to evaluate whether any of them was associated with poor prognosis in term and preterm infants. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records for all patients aged less than one year which were hospitalized during the winter season between November 2015 and April 2018 with clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis and nasopharyngeal aspirates positive for RSV. RESULTS: We enrolled 422 children, of which 50 were born preterm. During the analysis period, we observed a significant increase in the rates of oxygen supplementation and admission to intensive care unit. The evidence shows an alternating pattern in the prevalence of RSV subtypes among term born; in each epidemic season, the prevalent serotype is the cause of the majority of the cases requiring intensive care. Conversely, RSV-A is always prevalent in preterm children and caused most of the cases requiring intensive care. CONCLUSIONS: During the 3 seasons analyzed, we observed an alternating prevalence of RSV A and B. While there are no differences in severity between RSV A and B in term population, RSV-A is prevalent and causes most of the severe cases in the premature group. Furthermore, an increase in RSV-related oxygen therapy and PICU admission has been documented not only in the premature population. Considering the absence of appropriate therapeutic strategies, our work emphasizes the importance of implementing prophylaxis measures against RSV and highlights the urgent need to gain knowledge about immune response to the virus, also in premature children.

This short write-up explores the potential efficacy and established safety of chloroquine in COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Badyal, Dinesh Kumar; Mahajan, Rajiv","journal":"Int J Appl Basic Med Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bb18946f316629fb811a3f13e0c5e114e64dbd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363157/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijabmr.ijabmr_141_20","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","United States Food and Drug Administration","National Task Force","the Indian Council of Medical Research"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of COVID","Drug Administration","use of antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine","potential efficacy","phosphate hydroxychloroquine","Coronavirus disease","potential therapeutic benefits of existing drugs","established safety of chloroquine","World Health Organization","prophylaxis of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","infection","selected high-risk individuals","Indian Council of Medical Research","United States Food","short write-up","different parts","National Task Force","pandemic","reports","vaccine","limelight"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We evaluated a multiplex PCR assay panel, the FilmArray\u00AE pneumonia panel (FilmArray PP, BioFire Diagnostics), for detection of 35 respiratory pathogens and resistance determinants and compared the performance of the standard-of-care test in intensive care unit patients with lower respiratory tract infections. RESULTS: Among the 59 endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens obtained from 51 adult patients, FilmArray PP was effective in detecting respiratory bacterial pathogens with an overall positive percent agreement of 90% (95% confidence interval [CI], 73.5\u201397.9%) and negative percent agreement of 97.4% (95% CI, 96.0\u201398.4%). FilmArray PP semi-quantitative reporting demonstrated a concordance rate of 53.6% for the culture-positive specimens and 86.3% for the culture-negative specimens. FilmArray PP detected 16 viral targets, whereas the conventional viral isolation failed, except influenza A, which showed 100% concordance with PCR. Coinfections were detected in 42.3% of the specimens. Substantial discrepancies were observed in identifying antimicrobial resistance gene targets and in the susceptibility testing. However, FilmArray PP may still be useful at the early stage of pneumonia before culture and susceptibility test reports are available. Consequently, the results of FilmArray PP might alter the antibiotic prescription in 40.7% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: FilmArray PP offers a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for lower respiratory tract infections. However, clinical correlation is advised to determine its significance in interpreting multiple pathogens and detection of genes involved in antimicrobial resistance.","publish_time":"2019-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sze Hwei; Ruan, Sheng-Yuan; Pan, Sung-Ching; Lee, Tai-Fen; Chien, Jung-Yien; Hsueh, Po-Ren","journal":"J Microbiol Immunol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/426d6775eb996f739d136d5c479e4b723b2a490b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185395.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31806539/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2019.10.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118219301719; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118219301719","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BioFire Diagnostics","PP","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["results of FilmArray PP","FilmArray PP semi-quantitative reporting","respiratory pathogens","culture-positive specimens","culture-negative specimens","respiratory bacterial pathogens","pneumonia panel","lower respiratory tract infections","adult patients","individual patients","care test","intensive care unit patients","viral targets","multiple pathogens","antimicrobial resistance gene targets","resistance determinants","bronchoalveolar lavage specimens","negative percent agreement","overall positive percent agreement","microbial etiology of pneumonia","early stage of pneumonia","susceptibility test reports","detection of genes","administration of effective antibiotic therapy","multiplex PCR assay panel","susceptibility testing","antibiotic prescription","concordance rate","sensitive diagnostic method","Timely diagnostic investigation","conventional viral isolation","BioFire Diagnostics","endotracheal aspirates","significance","influenza","BACKGROUND","performance","standard","CONCLUSIONS","Substantial discrepancies","confidence interval","METHODS","clinical correlation","Coinfections"],"language":"en"},

Eventually, this epidemic was controlled by isolation and there has been no human infection reported since January 2004. However, research on different aspects of the SARS-CoV is not waning, as it is not known if this virus will re-emerge, especially since its origins and potential reservoir(s) are unresolved. The SARS-CoV genome is nearly 30kb in length and contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs). Some of these ORFs encode for genes that are homologous to proteins found in all known coronaviruses, namely the replicase genes (ORFs 1a and 1b) and the four structural proteins: nucleocapsid, spike, membrane and envelope, and these proteins are expected to be essential for the replication of the virus. The remaining eight ORFs encodes for accessory proteins, varying in length from 39 to 274 amino acids, which are unique to SARS-CoV. This review will summarize the expeditious research on these accessory viral proteins in three major areas: (i) the detection of antibodies against accessory proteins in the serum of infected patients, (ii) the expression, processing and cellular localization of the accessory proteins, and (iii) the effects of the accessory proteins on cellular functions. These in-depth molecular and biochemical characterizations of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, which have no homologues in other coronaviruses, may offer clues as to why the SARS-CoV causes such a severe and rapid attack in humans, while other coronaviruses that infect humans seem to be more forgiving.","publish_time":"2006-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Yee-Joo; Lim, Seng Gee; Hong, Wanjin","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21a63ed009a159f73ddefe1a97dcbd169272362b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114237.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354206001586; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354206001586","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV accessory proteins","accessory viral proteins","structural proteins","SARS-CoV genome","ORFs","infected humans","known coronaviruses","human transmissions","length","human infection","subsequent efficient human","cellular localization","potential reservoir","novel coronavirus","expeditious research","cellular functions","replicase genes","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","serum of infected patients","potential open reading frames","biochemical characterizations","nucleocapsid","spike","membrane","profound disturbances","major areas","expression","envelope","processing","rapid attack","Guangdong","detection of antibodies","different aspects","amino acids","origins","China","effects","homologues","countries","review","isolation","replication","clues","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

There are limited studies addressing acute respiratory illness (ARI) in urban Indigenous children, particularly those that address the upper airway microbiome and its relationship to disease. We aimed to describe the prevalence of upper airway viruses and bacteria in symptomatic and asymptomatic urban-based Australian Indigenous children aged less than 5 years. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of data collected at baseline in an ongoing prospective cohort study of urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children registered with a primary health care service in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, Australia. Clinical, demographic and epidemiological data and bilateral anterior nasal swabs were collected on enrolment. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasal swabs to detect 17 respiratory viruses and 7 bacteria. The primary outcome was the prevalence of these microbes at enrolment. Logistic regression was performed to investigate differences in microbe prevalence between children with and without acute respiratory illness with cough as a symptom (ARIwC) at time of specimen collection. RESULTS: Between February 2013 and October 2015, 164 children were enrolled. The median age at enrolment was 18.0 months (IQR 7.2\u201334.3), 49.4% were boys and 56 children (34.2%) had ARIwC. Overall, 133/164 (81%) nasal swabs were positive for at least one organism; 131 (79.9%) for any bacteria, 59 (36.2%) for any virus and 57 (34.8%) for both viruses and bacteria. Co-detection of viruses and bacteria was more common in females than males (61.4% vs 38.6%, p = 0.044). No microbes, alone or in combination, were significantly associated with the presence of ARIwC. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of upper airways microbes in asymptomatic children is similar to non-Indigenous children with ARIwC from the same region.

Their unique ability to fly, particular diet, roosting behavior, long life span, ability to echolocate and critical susceptibility to pathogens make them suitable host to harbor numerous zoonotic pathogens like virus, bacteria and parasite. Many factors are responsible for the emergence of bat borne zoonoses but the most precipitating factor is human intrusions. Deforestation declined the natural habitat and forced the bats and other wild life to move out of their niche.

To select effective siRNAs targeting RV-G, a plasmid-based transient co-transfection approach was used. In this, siRNAs were expressed as short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and their ability to inhibit RV-G gene expression was evaluated in cells transfected with a plasmid expressing RV-G. The nine different siRNAs designed to target RV-G exhibited varying degrees of knockdown of RV-G gene expression. One siRNA (si-G7) with considerable effect in knockdown of RV-G expression also demonstrated significant inhibition of RV multiplication in BHK-21 cells after in vitro challenge with the RV Pasteur virus-11 (PV-11) strain. A decrease in the number of fluorescent foci in siRNA-treated cells and a reduction (86.8 %) in the release of RV into infected cell culture supernatant indicated the anti-rabies potential of siRNA. Similarly, treatment with one siRNA targeting RV-N resulted in a decrease in the number of fluorescent foci and a reduction (85.9 %) in the release of RV. As a dual gene silencing approach where siRNAs targeting RV-G and RV-N genes were expressed from single construct, the anti-rabies-virus effect was observed as an 87.4 % reduction in the release of RV. These results demonstrate that siRNAs targeting RV-G and N, both in single and dual form, have potential as antiviral agent against rabies.

This study aimed to determine the performance of pneumococcal load quantified with a real-time polymerase-chain reaction in nasopharyngeal samples to diagnose invasive pneumococcal disease in children. METHODS: Matched case-control study of patients \u003C5 years of age with invasive pneumococcal disease admitted to the Manhi\u00E7a District Hospital (Mozambique) and asymptomatic controls recruited in different periods between 2006 and 2014. Cases were confirmed by a positive bacterial culture for S. pneumoniae in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from cases and controls and pneumococcal density was quantified by lytA real-time polymerase-chain reaction. RESULTS: Thirty cases (median age 12.8 months) and sixty controls (median age 11.7 months) were enrolled and 70% of them were male. Nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage was high in both groups: 28/30 (93.3%) for cases vs. 53/60 (88.3%) for controls (p = 0.71). Mean nasopharyngeal pneumococcal load was identified as a marker for invasive pneumococcal disease (7.0 log(10) copies/mL in cases vs. 5.8 log(10) copies/mL in controls, p\u003C0.001) and showed good discriminatory power (AUC-ROC: 82.1%, 95% CI 72.5%-91.8%). A colonization density of 6.5 log(10) copies/mL was determined as the optimal cut-off value to distinguish cases from controls (sensitivity 75.0%, specificity 73.6%). CONCLUSION: Use of non-invasive nasopharyngeal aspirates coupled with rapid and accurate quantification of pneumococcal load by real-time polymerase chain reaction has the potential to become a useful surrogate marker for early diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease in children.","publish_time":"2017-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brotons, Pedro; Bassat, Quique; Lanaspa, Miguel; Henares, Desiree; Perez-Arguello, Amaresh; Madrid, Lola; Balcells, Reyes; Acacio, Sozinho; Andres-Franch, Maria; Marcos, Maria Angeles; Valero-Rello, Ana; Mu\u00F1oz-Almagro, Carmen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca0eb068e5fa4d0bdb05c7d5d6a2a0e0fbd36e40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5599037.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28910402/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Mozambique"],"keyphrases":["pneumococcal density","nasopharyngeal pneumococcal load","Cases","Nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage","suspected invasive pneumococcal disease","performance of pneumococcal load","early diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease","accurate quantification of pneumococcal load","asymptomatic controls","real-time polymerase chain reaction","nasopharyngeal samples","children","log","copies","lytA real-time polymerase-chain reaction","median age","Use of non-invasive nasopharyngeal aspirates","years of age","months","colonization density","detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae","useful surrogate marker","Current diagnostic methods","Matched case-control study of patients","potential","limitations of accuracy","Manhi\u00E7a District Hospital","blood","timeliness","Mozambique","good discriminatory power","positive bacterial culture","AUC-ROC","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","optimal cut-off value","patient convenience","cerebrospinal fluid","different periods","groups","sensitivity","RESULTS","specificity","male"],"language":"en"},

We performed high-throughput sequencing analysis and specific PCR and RT-PCR on pools of anal and oropharyngeal swabs from Artibeus lituratus and Sturnira lilium collected in southern Brazil. As a result, a member of the family Adenoviridae related to human adenovirus C was detected in anal swabs from S. lilium. In addition, we detected a papillomavirus in an anal swab from A. lituratus. Our analyses also allowed the detection of adenoviruses and parvoviruses in oropharyngeal swabs collected from A. lituratus.

The overall positive rate of patient specimens was 49.4% (18 236/36 915), 5% of which carried two or more viruses simultaneously. HRV (15.6%) was the most predominantly detected virus, followed by IFVs (14.6%), HAdV (7.5%), HPIVs (5.8%), HCoVs (4.2%), HRSVs (3.6%), HBoV (1.9%), and HMPV (1.6%). Most of the ARIs were significantly correlated with clinical symptoms of fever, cough, and runny nose. Although HRV and HAdV were frequently detected throughout the year in patients, other respiratory viruses showed apparent seasonality. HRSVs and IFVs were the major causative agents of acute respiratory diseases in infants and young children.

In August of each of the years 1998\u20132003, between 149 and 185 4\u20138-month-old calves arrived at the station from 99 to 124 different beef-breeding herds, and remained until March the following year. Only calves that tested free from bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) were allowed to enter the station and original animal groups were kept isolated from new cattle in their original herds for three weeks before admission. Although neither prophylactic antibiotics, nor BRD vaccines were used, less than 0.7\u201313.2% (mean 5%) of the calves (n =970) required treatment for BRD during the first five weeks following entry. This was probably due, at least in part, to the season (the summer months) when the animals were commingled. In the six-month period August\u2013February, 38% of the animals were treated one or more times for BRD and mortality was 0.7%. Hereford and Aberdeen Angus calves had significantly higher treatment rates than Charolais, Simmental and Blonde d\u2019Aquitaine. Serological testing on samples obtained in August, November and January indicated that bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3) infections occurred each year before November after entry. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infections also occurred every year, but in 3/6 years this was not until after November. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infections occurred only every second year and were associated with a treatment peak and one death on one occasion (December). The herd remained BVDV free during the entire study period. The infection patterns for PIV-3 and BCoV indicated a high level of infectivity amongst bovine calves, whereas the incidence for BRSV was observed at a lower level. Although the rearing of the animals differed from conventional beef production, the study has shown that commingling animals from many sources is not necessarily associated with high morbidity within the first few weeks after arrival. By preventing BRD soon after commingling the prerequisites for protective vaccination at entry might be improved. Applied management routines are discussed.","publish_time":"2007-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"H\u00E4gglund, S.; Hjort, M.; Graham, D.

This editorial discusses many issues including priority emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases; the challenges of meeting international health regulations; the strengthening of global health systems; global pandemic funding; and the One Health approach to future pandemic planning. We recommend that the global health community unites to urgently address these issues in order to avoid the next humanitarian crisis.","publish_time":"2015-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ross, Allen G.P.; Crowe, Suzanne M.; Tyndall, Mark W.","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9db00bdadd768a01c0f12b42741a5c7c6c07ce7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128994.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971215001836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26253461/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971215001836; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2015.07.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global health community","global pandemic funding","strengthening of global health systems","Health approach","result of future global pandemics","future pandemic planning","order","issues","challenges of meeting international health regulations","Ebola virus pandemic declines","recent international crisis","humanitarian crisis","increasing frequency of pandemics","financial losses","infectious diseases","priority","great concern","editorial","Abstract","window of opportunity","decades"],"language":"en"},

Murine acute lung infection models mirror human pathologies in many aspects and contribute to our understanding of the disease and the development of novel treatment strategies. Despite progress in other fields of tissue imaging, histopathology remains the most conclusive and practical read out tool for the descriptive and semiquantitative evaluation of mouse pneumonia and therapeutic interventions. Here, we systematically describe and compare the distinctive histopathological features of established models of acute pneumonia in mice induced by Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, influenza A virus (IAV) and superinfection of IAV-incuced pneumonia with S. pneumoniae. Systematic comparisons of the models revealed striking differences in the distribution of lesions, the characteristics of pneumonia induced, principal inflammatory cell types, lesions in adjacent tissues, and the detectability of the pathogens in histological sections. We therefore identified core criteria for each model suitable for practical semiquantitative scoring systems that take into account the pathogen- and model-specific patterns of pneumonia. Other critical factors that affect experimental pathologies are discussed, including infectious dose, time kinetics, and the genetic background of the mouse strain. The substantial differences between the model-specific pathologies underscore the necessity of pathogen- and model-adapted criteria for the comparative quantification of experimental outcomes. These criteria also allow for the standardized validation and comparison of treatment strategies in preclinical models.","publish_time":"2017-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dietert, Kristina; Gutbier, Birgitt; Wienhold, Sandra M.; Reppe, Katrin; Jiang, Xiaohui; Yao, Ling; Chaput, Catherine; Naujoks, Jan; Brack, Markus; Kupke, Alexandra; Peteranderl, Christin; Becker, Stephan; von Lachner, Carolin; Baal, Nelli; Slevogt, Hortense; Hocke, Andreas C.; Witzenrath, Martin; Opitz, Bastian; Herold, Susanne; Hackstein, Holger; Sander, Leif E.; Suttorp, Norbert; Gruber, Achim D.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f4a156d0bc65afd5d8f5b80b4bb8436a590955a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5695780.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29155867/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188251","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella","S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["characteristics of pneumonia","incuced pneumonia","model-specific patterns of pneumonia","model-specific pathologies","semiquantitative evaluation of mouse pneumonia","model-adapted criteria","preclinical models","model suitable","experimental pathologies","distinctive histopathological features of established models of acute pneumonia","Klebsiella pneumoniae","human pathologies","practical semiquantitative","core criteria","Murine acute lung infection models","comparison of treatment strategies","distribution of lesions","necessity of pathogen","superinfection of IAV","striking differences","development of novel treatment strategies","infectious dose","mouse strain","substantial differences","wide range of pathogens","common infectious cause of death","comparative quantification of experimental outcomes","Escherichia coli","Acinetobacter baumannii","Legionella pneumophila","Middle East respiratory syndrome","MERS","coronavirus","principal inflammatory cell types","Staphylococcus aureus","systems","adjacent tissues","detectability","histopathology","genetic background","time kinetics","influenza","tool","standardized validation","Streptococcus","mice","fields of tissue imaging","therapeutic interventions","disease","humans","aspects","account","Systematic comparisons","progress","understanding","histological sections","critical factors"],"language":"en"},

The crescent-shaped bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domains remodel membranes in multiple cellular pathways. Based on studies of isolated BAR domains in vitro, the current paradigm is that BAR domain\u2013containing proteins polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds that stabilize lipid tubules. But in nature, proteins that contain BAR domains often also contain large intrinsically disordered regions. Using in vitro and live cell assays, here we show that full-length BAR domain\u2013containing proteins, rather than stabilizing membrane tubules, are instead surprisingly potent drivers of membrane fission. Specifically, when BAR scaffolds assemble at membrane surfaces, their bulky disordered domains become crowded, generating steric pressure that destabilizes lipid tubules. More broadly, we observe this behavior with BAR domains that have a range of curvatures. These data suggest that the ability to concentrate disordered domains is a key driver of membrane remodeling and fission by BAR domain\u2013containing proteins.","publish_time":"2019-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Snead, Wilton T.; Zeno, Wade F.; Kago, Grace; Perkins, Ryan W.; Richter, J Blair; Zhao, Chi; Lafer, Eileen M.; Stachowiak, Jeanne C.","journal":"J Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f69a764a32e9fefc971d79582da33db151cdeb5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d84514633b2de3a00d06955978cb5a2eebe0ea7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6363457.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6363457/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQ4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BAR scaffolds","studies of isolated BAR domains","full-length BAR domain","proteins","bulky disordered domains","domains remodel membranes","stabilizing membrane tubules","membrane surfaces","lipid tubules","potent drivers of membrane fission","Cellular membranes","disordered regions","key driver of membrane remodeling","cylindrical scaffolds","multiple cellular pathways","rvs","steric pressure","current paradigm","crescent-shaped bin-amphiphysin","ability","nature","live cell assays","range of curvatures","behavior","data"],"language":"en"},

Genomic DNA of the CC lines was genotyped with high\u2010density single nucleotide polymorphic markers. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed a significant (P \u003C 0.05) variation of liver weight between the CC lines, with broad sense heritability (H (2)) of 0.32 and genetic coefficient of variation (CV(G)) of 0.28.

Patients over 65 years old who were newly diagnosed with PD during 2007\u20132011 were identified. The integrative therapy group was defined as patients treated with both Korean medicine (KM) and biomedicine, and the monotherapy group consisted of patients treated with biomedicine alone. From PD diagnosis to 2013, the prevalence and annual length of hospitalization because of PD and major complications (dementia, depression and pneumonia/sepsis) were analyzed using logistic regression, ANOVA and t-tests after propensity score (PS) matching with a 1:1 ratio. Results: After PS estimation and matching, the cohort used in the analysis included 228 subjects (114 integrative therapy group, 114 monotherapy group). Sex, age, index year, comorbidity, severity of disability, neurologic care, and anti-parkinsonism medication (levodopa, ropinirole, pramipexole, selegiline) were adjusted in both groups.

Conclusion: It has not been clearly identified that integrative therapy with KM and biomedicine for PD management is better treatment for patients compared to biomedicine monotherapy; however, we found a clue of better result in integrated therapy. Therefore, further investigation by increasing the number of subjects is needed to confirm the findings presented herein.","publish_time":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woo, Yeonju; Hyun, Min Kyung","journal":"Front Aging Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4eb512e8b51929e92cae935e6355b1b571e9e7b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6399136.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6399136/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort","PD"],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["integrative therapy group","monotherapy group","effectiveness of integrative therapy","prevalence of hospitalization","biomedicine monotherapy","PD management","integrated therapy","Patients","PD diagnosis","annual length of hospitalization","annual length of total hospitalization","dementia","retrospective cohort analysis","depression","matching","sepsis","pneumonia","South Korea","management of major complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease","National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort","better treatment","positive results","PS estimation","number of subjects","clue of better result","anti-parkinsonism medication","neurologic care","comorbidity","levodopa","ropinirole","severity of disability","t-tests","index year","propensity score","ANOVA","logistic regression","selegiline","pramipexole","study","Sex","Korean medicine","differences","lower","years old","Methods","investigation","times","groups","Objectives","ratio","findings","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

LASV is endemic to West Africa and is transmitted through contact with excretions of infected Mastomys natalensis rodents and other rodent species. Due to a high fatality rate, lack of treatment options and difficulties with prevention and control, LASV is one of the high-priority pathogens included in the WHO R\u0026D Blueprint. The WHO LASV vaccine strategy relies on availability of effective diagnostic tests. Current diagnostics for LASV include in-house and commercial (primarily research-only) laboratory-based serological and nucleic acid amplification tests. There are two commercially available (for research use only) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and a number of multiplex panels for differential detection of LASV infection from other endemic diseases with similar symptoms have been evaluated. However, a number of diagnostic gaps remain. Lineage detection is a challenge due to the genomic diversity of LASV, as pan-lineage sensitivity for both molecular and immunological detection is necessary for surveillance and outbreak response. While pan-lineage ELISA and RDTs are commercially available (for research use only), validation and external quality assessment (EQA) is needed to confirm detection sensitivity for all known or relevant strains. Variable sensitivity of LASV PCR tests also highlights the need for improved validation and EQA. Given that LASV outbreaks typically occur in low-resource settings, more options for point-of-care testing would be valuable. These requirements should be taken into account in target product profiles for improved LASV diagnostics.","publish_time":"2019-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mazzola, Laura T; Kelly-Cirino, Cassandra","journal":"BMJ Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c04cea5393ee21d23a0d8257fc67fecb57899a38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6407561.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6407561/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzUyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LASV","EQA"],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["LASV outbreaks","improved LASV diagnostics","differential detection of LASV infection","LASV vaccine strategy","genomic diversity of LASV","Variable sensitivity of LASV PCR tests","detection sensitivity","Lineage detection","rapid diagnostic tests","pan-lineage sensitivity","immunological detection","research use","availability of effective diagnostic tests","symptoms similar","similar symptoms","improved validation","EQA","RDTs","number of diagnostic gaps","lineage ELISA","nucleic acid amplification tests","Lassa fever virus","endemic diseases","Current diagnostics","lack of treatment options","number of multiplex panels","high fatality rate","Ebola virus infections","high-priority pathogens","acute viral haemorrhagic fever","excretions of infected Mastomys natalensis rodents","contact","difficulties","target product profiles","need","point","account","surveillance","prevention","low-resource settings","rodent species","external quality assessment","laboratory","challenge","West Africa","control","care testing","outbreak response","relevant strains","D Blueprint","requirements"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about the functions of fish autophagy-related genes (Atgs). In this study, we cloned and characterized Atg5, a key gene in the autophagy gene superfamily, from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (EcAtg5). EcAtg5 encoded a 275-amino acid protein that shared 94 and 81% identity to seabass (Lates calcarifer) and humans (Homo sapiens), respectively. The transcription level of EcAtg5 was significantly increased in cells infected with red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV). In cells infected with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), EcAtg5 expression declined during the early stage of infection and increased in the late stage. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that EcAtg5 mainly localized with a dot-like pattern in the cytoplasm of grouper cells. Overexpression of EcAtg5 significantly increased the replication of RGNNV and SGIV at different levels of detection, as indicated by increased severity of the cytopathic effect, transcription levels of viral genes, and levels of viral proteins. Knockdown of EcAtg5 decreased the replication of RGNNV and SGIV. Further studies showed that overexpression EcAtg5 activated autophagy, decreased expression levels of interferon related cytokines or effectors and pro-inflammatory factors, and inhibited the activation of nuclear factor \u03BAB, IFN-sensitive response element, and IFNs. In addition, ectopic expression of EcAtg5 affected cell cycle progression by hindering the G1/S transition. Taken together, our results demonstrated that fish Atg5 exerted a crucial role in virus replication by promoting autophagy, down-regulating antiviral IFN responses, and affecting the cell cycle.","publish_time":"2019-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Chen; Liu, Jiaxin; Zhang, Xin; Wei, Shina; Huang, Xiaohong; Huang, Youhua; Wei, Jingguang; Qin, Qiwei","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a8e26038c98efac0a61629aa6b768fefad5a573.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6433989.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6433989/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Autophagy","SGIV","G1/S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EcAtg5 expression","Overexpression of EcAtg5","overexpression EcAtg5","Knockdown of EcAtg5","ectopic expression of EcAtg5","transcription level of EcAtg5","cytoplasm of grouper cells","replication of RGNNV","SGIV","autophagy gene superfamily","transcription levels of viral genes","virus replication","eukaryotic cells","increased severity","functions of fish autophagy-related genes","orange-spotted grouper","levels of viral proteins","decreased expression levels of interferon related cytokines","different levels of detection","Singapore grouper iridovirus","fish Atg5","red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus","cell cycle progression","key gene","characterized Atg5","late stage","antiviral IFN responses","early stage of infection","IFN-sensitive response element","effectors","cytopathic effect","activation of nuclear factor \u03BAB","pro-inflammatory factors","Lates calcarifer","crucial role","humans","homeostasis","G1","important biological activity","Epinephelus coioides","seabass","pattern","Atgs","Homo sapiens","identity","IFNs","dot","addition","studies","amino acid protein","S transition","study","results","Fluorescence microscopy"],"language":"en"},

We discuss the dual role of microglia in disease development, the beneficial functions crucial for bacterial clearing, and the destructive properties through triggering neuroinflammation, characterized by cytokine and chemokine release which leads to leukocyte trafficking through the brain vascular endothelium and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier integrity. Due to intrinsic complexity of microglia and up until recently lack of specific markers, the study of microglial response to bacterial pathogens is challenging. New experimental models and techniques open up possibilities to accelerate progress in the field. We review existing models and discuss possibilities and limitations. Finally, we summarize recent findings where bacterial virulence factors are identified to be important for the microglial response, and how manipulation of evoked responses could be used for therapeutic or preventive purposes. Among promising approaches are: modulations of microglia phenotype switching toward anti-inflammatory and phagocytic functions, the use of non-bacterolytic antimicrobials, preventing release of bacterial components into the neural milieu and consequential amplification of immune activation, and protection of the blood-brain barrier integrity.","publish_time":"2019-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thorsdottir, Sigrun; Henriques-Normark, Birgitta; Iovino, Federico","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aaa7d4e5136a4175368222cba1f76b0a33f5a688.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6442515.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6442515/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzU3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial pathogens","bacterial clearing","release of bacterial components","dual role of microglia","bacterial virulence factors","pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis","modulations of microglia phenotype","intrinsic complexity of microglia","blood-brain barrier integrity","brain vascular endothelium","possibilities","review","study of microglial response","phagocytic functions","chemokine release","pivotal role","novel preventive","therapeutic strategies","existing models","preventive purposes","beneficial functions crucial","New experimental models","use of non-bacterolytic antimicrobials","neural milieu","disease development","consequential amplification of immune activation","leukocyte trafficking","protection","breakdown","gained knowledge","techniques","destructive properties","triggering neuroinflammation","lack of specific markers","cytokine","recent findings","manipulation of evoked responses","promising approaches","possible ways","progress","limitations","interplay","overview","field","goal"],"language":"en"},

The rabies vector is a well-established vaccine strain that lacks neurovirulence and can stably expresses foreign antigens that are immunogenic in various animal models. Mice inoculated intranasally with the live recombinant RABV/NiV vaccine (NIPARAB) showed no signs of disease. To test the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate, groups of C57BL/6 mice were immunized intramuscularly with a single dose of live vaccine particles or two doses of chemically inactivated viral particles. Both vaccination groups showed NiV G-specific seroconversion, and the inactivated (INAC) vaccine group yielded higher titers of NiV G-specific antibodies. Furthermore, cross-reactivity of NiV G-specific immune sera against Hendra virus (HeV), was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) and indirect ELISA against soluble recombinant HeV glycoprotein (HeV G).

We inferred seven multilocus haplotypes from linked alleles in the Core Region and revealed structural variation of the class II region that probably evolved through unequal crossing over. Based on the low polymorphism, structural variation, strong linkage, and extensive shared alleles, we applied the MHC haplotypes in population analysis. The genetic variation and population structure at MHC haplotypes are generally concordant with those expected from microsatellites, underlining the predominant role of genetic drift in shaping MHC variation in the bottlenecked populations. Nonetheless, some populations showed elevated differentiation at MHC, probably due to limited gene flow. The seven populations were significantly differentiated into three groups and some groups exhibited genetic monomorphism, which can be attributed to founder effects.

We hypothesize that thymocyte development is altered by infected thymic antigen presenting cells (TAPCs) in the fetal/neonatal thymus that interact with double-positive thymocytes causing an acute deficiency of T cells that produces \u201Choles\u201D in the T cell repertoire allowing for poor recognition of PRRSV and other neonatal pathogens. The deficiency may be the result of random elimination of PRRSV-specific T cells or the generation of T cells that accept PRRSV epitopes as self-antigens. Loss of helper T cells for virus neutralizing (VN) epitopes can result in the failure of selection for B cells in lymph node germinal centers capable of producing high affinity VN antibodies. Generation of cytotoxic and regulatory T cells may also be impaired. Similar to infections with LDV, LCMV, MCMV, HIV-1 and trypanosomes, the host responds to the deficiency of pathogen-specific T cells and perhaps regulatory T cells, by \u201Clast ditch\u201D polyclonal B cell activation. In colostrum-deprived PRRSV-infected isolator piglets, this results in hypergammaglobulinemia, which we believe to be a \u201Cred herring\u201D that detracts attention from the thymic atrophy story, but leads to our second independent hypothesis. Since hypergammaglobulinemia has not been reported in PRRSV-infected conventionally-reared piglets, we hypothesize that this is due to the down-regulatory effect of passive maternal IgG and cytokines in porcine colostrum, especially TGF\u03B2 which stimulates development of regulatory T cells (Tregs).","publish_time":"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Butler, John E.; Sinkora, Marek; Wang, Gang; Stepanova, Katerina; Li, Yuming; Cai, Xuehui","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37cae647fffbd8ed2ba338d805a6029577621c1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6529568.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6529568/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzY3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Critical Window of Immunological Development","VN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific T cells","generation of T cells","development of regulatory T cells","B cells","acute deficiency of T cells","Loss of helper T cells","T cell repertoire","PRRSV epitopes","poor recognition of PRRSV","colostrum-deprived PRRSV-infected isolator piglets","result of random elimination of PRRSV","porcine colostrum","infected thymic antigen","deficiency of pathogen","thymocyte development","hypergammaglobulinemia","regulatory effect of passive maternal IgG","polyclonal B cell activation","Critical Window of Immunological Development","Generation of cytotoxic","neonatal thymus","neonatal pathogens","reared piglets","respiratory syndrome virus","thymic atrophy story","high affinity VN antibodies","lymph node germinal centers capable","cytokines","immune dysregulation","TAPCs","ditch","TGF\u03B2","MCMV","LDV","LCMV","attention","double-positive thymocytes","holes","failure of selection","HIV","infections","results","Tregs","self-antigens","trypanosomes","host","red herring","independent hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

The current study evaluated the effects of dietary 30 mg/kg quercetin supplementation on C. rodentium-induced experimental colitis in C57BL/6 mice. Following dietary quercetin supplementation, the mice were infected with 5 \u00D7 10(8) CFU C. rodentium, and the pathological effects of C. rodentium were measured. The results showed that quercetin alleviated the effects of C. rodentium-induced colitis, suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-17, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-6 (p \u003C 0.05), and promoted the production of IL-10 in the colon tissues (p \u003C 0.05). Quercetin supplementation also enhanced the populations of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridia and significantly reduced those of Fusobacterium and Enterococcus (p \u003C 0.05). These findings indicate that dietary quercetin exerts therapeutic effects on C. rodentium-induced colitis, probably due to quercetin\u2019s ability to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or modify gut microbiota.

Recognizing the outbreak, concerted efforts were made to control viral spread, which included mosquito control, public announcement of the outbreak, and a total ban on entering the park. We sought to assess the effectiveness of these control measures. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a mathematical model to describe the transmission dynamics. Using dates of exposure and illness onset, we categorized cases into three groups according to the availability of these datasets. The infection process was parametrically modeled by generation, and convolution of the infection process and the incubation period was fitted to the data. By estimating the effective reproduction number, we determined that the effect of dengue risk communication together with mosquito control from 28 August 2014 was insufficiently large to lower the reproduction number to below 1. However, once Yoyogi Park was closed on 4 September, the value of the effective reproduction number began to fall below 1, and the associated relative reduction in the effective reproduction number was estimated to be 20%\u201360%. The mean incubation period was an estimated 5.8 days. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Regardless of the assumed number of generations of cases, the combined effect of mosquito control, risk communication, and park closure appeared to be successful in interrupting the chain of dengue transmission in Tokyo.","publish_time":"2019-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Baoyin; Lee, Hyojung; Nishiura, Hiroshi","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8423ebcd07e62c48ca7205a06fee753f9199e58.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6588210.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6588210/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzczMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Tokyo","Japan"],"keyphrases":["effective reproduction number","control measures","Yoyogi Park","combined effect of mosquito control","park closure","autochthonous outbreak of dengue","chain of dengue transmission","assumed number of generations","effect of dengue risk communication","cases","Tokyo","infection process","transmission dynamics","mean incubation period","focal area of transmission","associated relative reduction","mathematical model","viral spread","illness onset","public announcement","Japan","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","concerted efforts","dates of exposure","summer","convolution","SIGNIFICANCE","days","total ban","value","availability","METHODOLOGY","groups","effectiveness","datasets","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Liberated attenuator RNAs arising in this process are generally considered nonfunctional. In Sinorhizobium meliloti, the tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis genes are organized into three operons, trpE(G), ppiD-trpDC-moaC-moeA, and trpFBA-accD-folC, of which only the first one, trpE(G), contains a short ORF (trpL) in the 5\u2032-UTR and is regulated by transcription attenuation. Under conditions of Trp sufficiency, transcription is terminated between trpL and trpE(G), and a small attenuator RNA, rnTrpL, is produced. Here, we show that rnTrpL base-pairs with trpD and destabilizes the polycistronic trpDC mRNA, indicating rnTrpL-mediated downregulation of the trpDC operon in trans. Although all three trp operons are regulated in response to Trp availability, only in the two operons trpE(G) and trpDC the Trp-mediated regulation is controlled by rnTrpL. Together, our data show that the trp attenuator coordinates trpE(G) and trpDC expression posttranscriptionally by two fundamentally different mechanisms: ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation in cis and base-pairing in trans. Also, we present evidence that rnTrpL-mediated regulation of trpDC genes expression in trans is conserved in Agrobacterium and Bradyrhizobium, suggesting that the small attenuator RNAs may have additional conserved functions in the control of bacterial gene expression.","publish_time":"2019-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Melior, Hendrik; Li, Siqi; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; St\u00F6tzel, Maximilian; Azarderakhsh, Saina; Barth-Weber, Susanne; Baumgardt, Kathrin; Ziebuhr, John; Evguenieva-Hackenberg, Elena","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c51eafc88ddf46d27452c1a1b7a009c5341e848.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6614838.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6614838/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ORF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Trp-mediated regulation","trpDC expression","trp operons","rnTrpL-mediated regulation of trpDC genes expression","trp attenuator coordinates trpE","operons trpE","rnTrpL-mediated downregulation","Ribosome-mediated transcription attenuation","ppiD-trpDC","trpDC operon","Trp availability","polycistronic trpDC mRNA","small attenuator RNAs","rnTrpL base-pairs","conditions of Trp sufficiency","Liberated attenuator RNAs","basic posttranscriptional regulation mechanism","control of bacterial gene expression","biosynthesis genes","additional conserved functions","different mechanisms","tryptophan","moaC-moeA","process","Bradyrhizobium","present evidence","response","trpFBA-accD","Agrobacterium","Sinorhizobium meliloti","short ORF","data","folC","UTR"],"language":"en"},

Following an iterative process, the viruses are virtually ranked in an outer- to inner-body fashion, by organ system, on ecological grounds.

The synthesis of the findings reveals a predictive virus evolution framework, based on the outer- to inner-body changes in the interplay of host environment-transmission modes-organ system involvement-host cell infection cycle-virus genome. Outer-body viruses opportunistically respond to the variation in the external environment. For example, respiratory and enteric viruses tend to be associated with poultry and pig mass rearing.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the protective effect on calves of colostrum from cows vaccinated with a commercially available Salmonella Newport bacterin against a Salmonella Typhimurium challenge. ANIMALS: Twenty Holstein bull calves from a university dairy farm. METHODS: Nonrandomized placebo\u2010controlled trial in which colostrum was harvested from 30 cows that received 2 doses of either Salmonella bacterin or saline before calving. Colostrum collected from each group was pooled and fed to 2 groups of 10 calves at birth. At approximately 2 weeks of age, calves were challenged with Salmonella Typhimurium. Clinical, hematologic, microbiological, and postmortem findings were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: No differences in mortality, clinical findings, hematology results, blood and fecal cultures, or necropsy findings between the 2 groups were observed. Vaccinated cows had higher colostral titers, and calves fed this colostrum had higher serum titers (mean difference, 0.429; mean [SE], 0.852 [0.02] for vaccinated versus 0.423 [0.02] for control calves). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Transfer of colostral immunoglobulins from Salmonella enterica serotype Newport bacterin to neonatal calves was not sufficient to decrease mortality, clinical signs, sepsis, intestinal damage, or fecal shedding when exposed to a highly pathogenic Salmonella isolate. A large\u2010scale randomized controlled clinical trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of this bacterin when administered in the dry period for prevention of salmonellosis in neonatal calves.","publish_time":"2019-05-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foster, Derek; Jacob, Megan; Stowe, Devorah; Smith, Geof","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24bc853dce27cbe938ca42aefdaa4e788df30481.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6639490.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6639490/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozc5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella"],"organizations":["Salmonella Newport"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["calves of colostrum","neonatal calves","Salmonella bacterin","control calves","clinical findings","Holstein bull calves","available Salmonella Newport bacterin","mortality","clinical signs","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","Salmonella Typhimurium challenge","Vaccinated cows","groups","Salmonella enterica serotype Newport bacterin","pathogenic Salmonella isolate","large\u2010scale randomized controlled clinical trial","higher colostral titers","necropsy findings","controlled trial","postmortem findings","higher serum titers","fecal cultures","hematology results","fecal shedding","prevention of salmonellosis","mean difference","Transfer of colostral immunoglobulins","blood","intestinal damage","sepsis","major cause of morbidity","university dairy farm","Nonrandomized placebo","dry period","protective effect","METHODS","saline","doses","differences","OBJECTIVE","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","ANIMALS","calving","preventative vaccines","weeks of age","efficacy","birth","HYPOTHESIS"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of the Trial of Respiratory infections in children for ENhanced Diagnostics (TREND) study is to improve the differential diagnosis of bacterial and viral etiologies in children aged below 5 years with clinical CAP, by evaluating myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) as a biomarker for viral CAP and by evaluating an existing (multianalyte point-of-care antigen detection test system [mariPOC respi] ArcDia International Oy Ltd.) and a potential future point-of-care test for respiratory pathogens. METHODS: Children aged 1 to 59 months with clinical CAP as well as healthy, hospital-based, asymptomatic controls will be included at a pediatric emergency hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. Blood (analyzed for MxA and C-reactive protein) and nasopharyngeal samples (analyzed with real-time polymerase chain reaction as the gold standard and antigen-based mariPOC respi test as well as saved for future analyses of a novel recombinase polymerase amplification\u2013based point-of-care test for respiratory pathogens) will be collected. A newly developed algorithm for the classification of CAP etiology will be used as the reference standard. RESULTS: A pilot study was performed from June to August 2017.

Since the beginning of October 2018, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has occurred, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used available data on the current outbreak, with case-count time series from prior outbreaks, to project the short-term and long-term course of the outbreak. METHODS: For short- and long-term projections, we modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process that assumes gradually quenching transmission rates estimated from past EVD outbreaks, with outbreak trajectories conditioned on agreement with the course of the current outbreak, and with multiple levels of vaccination coverage. We used two regression models to estimate similar projection periods. Short- and long-term projections were estimated using negative binomial autoregression and Theil-Sen regression, respectively. We also used Gott\u2019s rule to estimate a baseline minimum-information projection. We then constructed an ensemble of forecasts to be compared and recorded for future evaluation against final outcomes. From August 20, 2018 to February 25, 2019, short-term model projections were validated against known case counts. RESULTS: During validation of short-term projections, from one week to four weeks, we found models consistently scored higher on shorter-term forecasts. Based on case counts as of February 25, the stochastic model projected a median case count of 933 cases by February 18 (95% prediction interval: 872\u20131054) and 955 cases by March 4 (95% prediction interval: 874\u20131105), while the auto-regression model projects median case counts of 889 (95% prediction interval: 876\u2013933) and 898 (95% prediction interval: 877\u2013983) cases for those dates, respectively. Projected median final counts range from 953 to 1,749. Although the outbreak is already larger than all past Ebola outbreaks other than the 2013\u20132016 outbreak of over 26,000 cases, our models do not project that it is likely to grow to that scale. The stochastic model estimates that vaccination coverage in this outbreak is lower than reported in its trial setting in Sierra Leone. CONCLUSIONS: Our projections are concentrated in a range up to about 300 cases beyond those already reported. While a catastrophic outbreak is not projected, it is not ruled out, and prevention and vigilance are warranted. Prospective validation of our models in real time allowed us to generate more accurate short-term forecasts, and this process may prove useful for future real-time short-term forecasting. We estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under target levels of 62% coverage due to contact tracing and vaccination, and this model estimate may offer a surrogate indicator for the outbreak response challenges.","publish_time":"2019-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Worden, Lee; Wannier, Rae; Hoff, Nicole A.; Musene, Kamy; Selo, Bernice; Mossoko, Mathias; Okitolonda-Wemakoy, Emile; Muyembe Tamfum, Jean Jacques; Rutherford, George W.; Lietman, Thomas M.; Rimoin, Anne W.; Porco, Travis C.; Kelly, J.

PRRSV causes devastating losses to the porcine industry. However, due to its high antigenic variability and poorly understood immunopathogenesis, there is currently no effective vaccine or treatment to control PRRSV infection. The common occurrence of PRRSV infection with bacterial infections as well as its inflammatory-driven pathobiology raises the question of the value of antibiotics with immunomodulating properties for the treatment of the disease it causes. The macrolide antibiotic Tulathromycin (TUL) has been found to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties in cattle and pigs. The aim of this study was to characterize the anti-viral and immunomodulating properties of TUL in PRRSV-infected porcine macrophages. Our findings indicate that blood monocyte-derived macrophages are readily infected by PRRSV and can be used as an effective cellular model to study PRRSV pathogenesis. TUL did not change intracellular or extracellular viral titers, not did it alter viral receptors (CD163 and CD169) expression on porcine macrophages. In contrast, TUL exhibited potent immunomodulating properties, which therefore occurred in the absence of any direct antiviral effects against PRRSV. TUL had an additive effect with PRRSV on the induction of macrophage apoptosis, and inhibited virus-induced necrosis. TUL significantly attenuated PRRSV-induced macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling (CXCL-8 and mitochondrial ROS production) and prevented PRRSV inhibition of non-opsonized and opsonized phagocytic function. Together, these data demonstrate that TUL inhibits PRRSV-induced inflammatory responses in porcine macrophages and protects against the phagocytic impairment caused by the virus. Research in live pigs is warranted to assess the potential clinical benefits of this antibiotic in the context of virally induced inflammation and tissue injury.","publish_time":"2019-08-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Desmonts de Lamache, D.; Moges, R.; Siddiq, A.; Allain, T.; Feener, T.

Current efforts to develop transmissible vaccines use recombinant vector technology whereby pathogen antigens are engineered to be expressed from innocuous infectious viral vectors. The resulting vaccines can transmit from host to host, amplifying the number of vaccine\u2010protected individuals beyond those initially vaccinated directly through parenteral inoculation. One main engineering challenge is the potential for natural selection to favor vaccine mutants that eliminate or reduce expression of antigenic inserts, resulting in immunogenic decay of the vaccine over time. Here, we study a mathematical model of vector mutation whereby continuous elimination of the antigenic insert results in reversion of the vaccine back into the insert\u2010free vector. We use this model to quantify the maximum allowable rate of reversion that can be tolerated for a transmissible vaccine to maintain a critical threshold level of immunogenicity against a target pathogen. Our results demonstrate that even for transmissible vaccines where reversion is frequent, performance will often substantially exceed that of conventional, directly administered vaccines. Further, our results demonstrate the feasibility of designing transmissible vaccines that yield desired levels of immunogenicity, yet degrade at a rate sufficient for persistence of the recombinant vaccine within the environment to be minimized.","publish_time":"2019-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nuismer, Scott L.; Basinski, Andrew; Bull, James J.","journal":"Evol Appl","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bafab6b3dd88dcdefe111698d02f81998c9accdb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6708430.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6708430/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Transmissible vaccines","recombinant vaccine","resulting vaccines","number of vaccine","vaccine mutants","antigenic insert results","recombinant vector technology","free vector","host","mathematical model of vector mutation","maximum allowable rate of reversion","target pathogen","rate sufficient","pathogen antigens","infectious disease","expression of antigenic inserts","desired levels of immunogenicity","critical threshold level of immunogenicity","innocuous infectious viral vectors","continuous elimination","pathogens","potential","immunogenic decay","revolutionary approach","inaccessible wildlife populations","persistence","feasible methods","Current efforts","main engineering challenge","protected individuals","time","performance","feasibility","environment","parenteral inoculation"],"language":"en"},

During the TN period for 21 days (d 1 to 21), calves receiving SB showed quadratic or linear effects compared to the control group, showing higher dry matter intake (DMI, p = 0.002), and water consumption (p = 0.007) but lower frequency of fecal diarrhea (p = 0.008), rectal temperature (p \u003C 0.001), heart rate (p \u003C 0.001), and fecal microbiota at 21 day (Escherichia coli, p = 0.025; Enterobacteriaceae, p = 0.041). Meanwhile, calves exposed to HS for 7 days (d 22 to 28) receiving SB showed quadratic or linear effects compared to the control group, showing higher DMI (p = 0.002) but lower water consumption (p = 0.023), rectal temperature (p = 0.026), and cortisol level (p = 0.014). Our results suggest that live SB is useful in the livestock industry as an alternative to conventional medication (especially in times of suspected health problems) that can be added to milk replacer for young dairy calves experiencing HS.","publish_time":"2019-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jae-Sung; Kacem, Nouali; Kim, Won-Seob; Peng, Dong Qiao; Kim, Young-Jun; Joung, Youn-Geun; Lee, Chanhee; Lee, Hong-Gu","journal":"Animals (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e43122d298db29a31acc538436b5f3a10621995.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6719173.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6719173/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":["CNCM","HS","DMI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Holstein dairy calves","rectal temperature","live SB","HS","diet of young dairy calves","physiological traits of Holstein calves","heart rate","linear effects","lower water consumption","diarrhea frequency","negative impact of heat stress","lower frequency of fecal diarrhea","higher DMI","effects of Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM","alleviating diarrhea","performance","control group","higher dry matter intake","fecal bacteria population","cortisol level","fecal microbiota","milk replacer","study","days of age","results","TN period","modulating pathogenic bacteria","alternative anti-stressor","livestock industry","conventional medication","Escherichia coli","feed additive","thermal neutral","digestive tract","times of suspected health problems","body weight","supplementation","conditions","Enterobacteriaceae","climatic chamber","SIMPLE SUMMARY","ABSTRACT","objective"],"language":"en"},

However, the risk factors and the mechanism underlying this toxicity have not been elucidated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been reported to transactivate EGFR in pulmonary epithelial cells. Hence, we aimed to test the hypothesis that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity regulates TNF-mediated bronchial epithelial cell survival, and that inhibition of EGFR activity increases TNF-induced lung epithelial cell apoptosis. We used surfactant protein C (SPC)-TNF transgenic (tg) mice which overexpress TNF in the lungs. In this model, gefitinib, an EGFR-TKI, enhanced lung epithelial cell apoptosis and lymphocytic inflammation, indicating that EGFR tyrosine kinase prevents TNF-induced lung injury. Furthermore, IL-17A was significantly upregulated by gefitinib in SPC-TNF tg mice and p38MAPK activation was observed, indicative of a pathway involved in lung epithelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, in lung epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, TNF stimulated EGFR transactivation via the TNF-\u03B1-converting enzyme in a manner that requires heparin binding (HB)-EGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B1. These novel findings have significant implications in understanding the role of EGFR in maintaining human bronchial epithelial cell homeostasis and in NSCLC treatment.","publish_time":"2019-08-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yamaoka, Toshimitsu; Arata, Satoru; Homma, Mayumi; Homma, Tetsuya; Kusumoto, Sojiro; Ando, Koichi; Manabe, Ryou; Kishino, Yasunari; Ohba, Motoi; Tsurutani, Junji; Takimoto, Masafumi; Ohmori, Tohru; Sagara, Hironori","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e3f168287dc3669b48862c0e70e000fc49edf00a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6720446.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6720446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozg3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFR","TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TNF-\u03B1","EGFR-TKIs","TNF stimulated EGFR transactivation","role of EGFR","transactivate EGFR","TNF transgenic","lung epithelial cells","inhibition of EGFR activity increases TNF-induced lung epithelial cell apoptosis","enhanced lung epithelial cell apoptosis","TNF-induced lung injury","EGFR tyrosine kinase activity","bronchial epithelial cell survival","SPC-TNF tg mice","human bronchial epithelial cell homeostasis","pulmonary epithelial cells","non-small cell lung cancer","tyrosine kinase inhibitors","gefitinib","Tumor necrosis factor","use of epidermal growth factor receptor","NSCLC treatment","lymphocytic inflammation","BEAS","p38MAPK activation","manner","HB","pathway","heparin binding","significant implications","leading cause of death","indicative","surfactant protein C","TGF","enzyme","hypothesis","mechanism","Pneumonitis","novel findings","risk factors","toxicity","model","lungs","IL"],"language":"en"},

In this regard, currently two LRS platforms have demonstrated adequate performance: the Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and the nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Even though these techniques produce lower coverage and are more error prone than short-read sequencing, they continue to be more successful in identifying polycistronic RNAs, transcript isoforms including splice and transcript end variants, as well as transcript overlaps. Recent reports have successfully applied LRS for the investigation of the transcriptome of viruses belonging to various families. These studies have substantially increased the number of previously known viral RNA molecules. In this work, we used the Sequel and MinION technique from PacBio and ONT, respectively, to characterize the lytic transcriptome of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). In most samples, we analyzed the poly(A) fraction of the transcriptome, but we also performed random oligonucleotide-based sequencing. Besides cDNA sequencing, we also carried out native RNA sequencing. Our investigations identified more than 2,300 previously undetected transcripts, including coding, and non-coding RNAs, multi-splice transcripts, as well as polycistronic and complex transcripts. Furthermore, we found previously unsubstantiated transcriptional start sites, polyadenylation sites, and splice sites. A large number of novel transcriptional overlaps were also detected. Random-primed sequencing revealed that each convergent gene pair produces non-polyadenylated read-through RNAs overlapping the partner genes. Furthermore, we identified novel replication-associated transcripts overlapping the HSV-1 replication origins, and novel LAT variants with very long 5\u2019 regions, which are co-terminal with the LAT-0.7kb transcript. Overall, our results demonstrated that the HSV-1 transcripts form an extremely complex pattern of overlaps, and that entire viral genome is transcriptionally active. In most viral genes, if not in all, both DNA strands are expressed.","publish_time":"2019-09-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomb\u00E1cz, D\u00F3ra; Moldov\u00E1n, Norbert; Bal\u00E1zs, Zsolt; Guly\u00E1s, G\u00E1bor; Csabai, Zsolt; Boldogk\u0151i, Mikl\u00F3s; Snyder, Michael; Boldogk\u0151i, Zsolt","journal":"Front Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/70854e087e3757f5f8edadee91fcf9de1609b0bd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6769088.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769088/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzkxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","Pacific Biosciences","Oxford Nanopore Technologies"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nanopore sequencing","cDNA sequencing","native RNA sequencing","complex transcripts","Random-primed sequencing","transcript overlaps","splice sites","multi-splice transcripts","HSV","undetected transcripts","random oligonucleotide-based sequencing","Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing","novel replication-associated transcripts","polycistronic RNAs","transcript isoforms","viral genes","non-coding RNAs","transcript end variants","novel LAT variants","complex pattern of overlaps","viral RNA molecules","large number of novel transcriptional overlaps","polyadenylation sites","PacBio","transcriptome of viruses","lytic transcriptome","LRS platforms","ONT","RNA research","non-polyadenylated read-through RNAs","unsubstantiated transcriptional start sites","entire viral genome","complex transcriptomic architectures","replication origins","partner genes","Oxford Nanopore Technologies","convergent gene pair","adequate performance","Pacific Biosciences","herpes simplex virus type","error prone","strength","lower coverage","Sequel","MinION technique","co-terminal","regions","various families","techniques","fraction","Recent reports","regard","DNA strands","samples","investigations","work","studies","results"],"language":"en"},

Here we investigated the expression and function of TAM subsets in OSCC, especially in cancer cell proliferation. Biopsy sample from 44 patients with OSCC were examined for the expression of TAM markers and EGF by immunohistochemistry. EGF production of TAM subsets isolated from OSCC patients was assessed by flow cytometry. We also examined the effect of conditioned medium from TAM subsets on the proliferation of OSCC cells.

Luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), employing light-emitting proteins, were used to examine serum antibodies against several cancer-associated targets in blood donor controls and subjects with colon cancer (CC) and HNSCC. The assessment of antibodies against the wild type p53 tumor antigen showed that approximately 25% of the CC and 20% of the HNSCC patients were seropositive. In addition, humoral responses against two p53 mutants, p53-R175H and p53-R273H, generally tracked the antibody responses seen against wild type p53. Analysis of antibodies against highly specific biomarkers of HPV-16-associated malignancy, E2, E6, and E7 oncoproteins, revealed no seropositivity in blood donors and CC patients.

Studies were evaluated to summarise the extent to which they reported on, amongst others, clinical utility, user\u2010friendliness, turnaround\u2010time and technical performance (aspects previously identified as important). RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 1398 publications, of which 125 met the inclusion criteria. From these studies, 83 POCTs across several disease areas (including cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism and respiratory\u2010tract\u2010infections) were identified. There was an inconsistency between what is reported in the studies and what GPs consider important. GPs perceive clinical utility as the most important aspect, yet this was rarely included explicitly in test evaluations in the literature, with only 8% of evaluations incorporating it in their analysis/discussion. CONCLUSIONS: This review showed that, despite the growing market and development of new POCTs, studies evaluating such tests fail to report on aspects that GPs find important. To ensure that an evaluation of a POCT is useful to primary care clinicians, future evaluations should not only focus on the technical performance aspects of a test, but also report on the aspects relating to the clinical utility and risks.","publish_time":"2019-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lingervelder, Deon; Koffijberg, Hendrik; Kusters, Ron; IJzerman, Maarten J.","journal":"Int J Clin Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb828bb9f9c3a58b135f382517a9ebbe65fa6fc6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6790572.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6790572/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["included studies","qualitative studies","observational studies","applied studies","GPs","care tests","clinical utility","technical performance aspects","important aspect","test evaluations","primary care clinicians","usage of POCTs","development of new POCTs","type of study","future evaluations","extent","cardiovascular disease","disease areas","growing market","literature pertaining","venous thromboembolism","turnaround","simulations","time","user\u2010friendliness","trials","numerous point","assay","decision","general practitioners","initial search","infections","Medline","texts","interviews","surveys","biomarker","manufacturers","outcomes","METHODS","Scopus","RESULTS","publications","review","OBJECTIVES","analysis","practice","risks","Data","inclusion criteria","CONCLUSIONS","discussion","abstracts","inconsistency"],"language":"en"},

COVID-19 originated in China and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020. For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age. This begs the question as to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging. Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19. One is CD26 and the other is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence. Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity. Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase. Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication. Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment. Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts. As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL-6 production, we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side-effect, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sargiacomo, Camillo; Sotgia, Federica; Lisanti, Michael P.","journal":"Aging (Albany NY)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd2755d592ea619049679894e4ef830fd0a15437.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202514.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32229706/; https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs0Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapamycin","SASP","Azithromycin and Doxycycline"],"locations":["Middle East","China"],"keyphrases":["treatment of COVID","prevention of COVID","anti-aging drugs","anti-aging therapeutics","process of chronological aging","infection","viral replication","proposed therapeutics","Azithromycin","Doxycycline","disease","CD26","existing FDA-approved drugs","cellular protein synthesis","inhibitors of protein synthesis","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","used antibiotics","SARS-CoV","angiotensin system","new emerging zoonotic corona virus","well-known senescence marker","advanced chronological age","general class of antibiotics","significant senolytic activity","new clinical trials","MERS","induction","patients","higher mortality rate","side-effect","Quercetin","excellent safety profiles","prominent role","Beta-galactosidase","family","associations","SASP","hypothesis","senolytics","Chloroquine-related compounds","drug repurposing efforts","transmission","production","functional association","ACE","China","host receptors","aid","fight","pandemic","Rapamycin","enzyme","reason","question"],"language":"en"},

African bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the island\u2019s chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats. METHODS: Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different regions of Madagascar. We analyzed fecal and throat swabs to detect the presence of virus through amplification of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is highly conserved in all known coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed from positive specimens. RESULTS: From 351 frugivorous bats, we detected 14 coronaviruses from two endemic bats species, of which 13 viruses were identified from Pteropus rufus and one from Eidolon dupreanum, giving an overall prevalence of 4.5%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Malagasy strains belong to the genus Betacoronavirus but form three distinct clusters, which seem to represent previously undescribed genetic lineages. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CoVs circulate in frugivorous bats of Madagascar, demonstrating the needs to evaluate spillover risk to human populations especially for individuals that hunt and consume infected bats. Possible dispersal mechanisms as to how coronaviruses arrived on Madagascar are discussed.","publish_time":"2015-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Razanajatovo, Norosoa H; Nomenjanahary, Lalaina A; Wilkinson, David A; Razafimanahaka, Julie H; Goodman, Steven M; Jenkins, Richard K; Jones, Julia PG; Heraud, Jean-Michel","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/395fef2b73d1c568f900de94f5f6d908bc305f24.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4404003.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0271-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25888853/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs1NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Malagasy","Frugivorous"],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Africa","Madagascar"],"keyphrases":["frugivorous bats of Madagascar","infected bats","frugivorous bats feed","African bats","endemic bats species","Certain Malagasy bats","known coronaviruses","circulation of CoVs","bat species","risk of human infection","different regions of Madagascar","humans","human populations","insectivorous bat","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","spillover risk","genetic variant","Malagasy strains","Marburg viruses","Phylogenetic analyses","Phylogenetic analysis","recent study","severe infection","undescribed genetic lineages","Eidolon dupreanum","genus Betacoronavirus","South Africa","amplification","RdRp","trees","individuals","needs","close contact","MERS-CoV","natural reservoirs","presence of virus","Ebola","Pteropus rufus","island\u2019s chiropteran fauna","throat swabs","overall prevalence","distinct clusters","people","positive specimens","cause disease outbreaks","range of pathogens","Possible dispersal mechanisms","data","findings","home","fruits","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","bush meat","purpose"],"language":"en"},

CoVs have also emerged to cause severe epidemics in animals. A better understanding of the natural hosts and genetic diversity of CoVs are needed to help mitigate these threats. OBJECTIVE: To design and evaluate a molecular diagnostic tool for detection and identification of all currently recognized and potentially future emergent CoVs from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. STUDY DESIGN AND RESULTS: We designed a semi-nested, reverse transcription RT-PCR assay based upon 38 published genome sequences of human and animal CoVs. We evaluated this assay with 14 human and animal CoVs and 11 other non-CoV respiratory viruses. Through sequencing the assay\u0027s target amplicon, the assay correctly identified each of the CoVs; no cross-reactivity with the 11 common respiratory viruses was observed. The limits of detection ranged from 4 to 4 \u00D7 102 copies/reaction, depending on the CoV species tested. To assess the assay\u0027s clinical performance, we tested a large panel of previously studied specimens: 192 human respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients, 5 clinical specimens from COVID-19 patients, 81 poultry oral secretion specimens, 109 pig slurry specimens, and 31 aerosol samples from a live bird market. The amplicons of all RT-PCR-positive samples were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Our assay performed well with all tested specimens across all sample types. CONCLUSIONS: This assay can be used for detection and identification of all previously recognized CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, and potentially any emergent CoVs in the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiu, Leshan; Binder, Raquel A.; Alarja, Natalie A.; Kochek, Kara; Coleman, Kristen K.; Son Than, Th\u00E9; Bailey, Emily S.; Bui, Vuong N.; Toh, Teck-Hock; Erdman, Dean D.; Gray, Gregory C.","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bd1b1e6f4db991366f50e65f716fd47b2b1130b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192118.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32403008/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301335?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104391; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301335","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sanger"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal CoVs","recognized CoVs","tested specimens","human respiratory specimens","clinical specimens","future emergent CoVs","genetic diversity of CoVs","studied specimens","pig slurry specimens","international human epidemics","poultry oral secretion specimens","non-CoV respiratory viruses","reverse transcription RT-PCR assay","common respiratory viruses","identification","Orthocoronavirinae subfamily","severe epidemics","SARS-CoV","CoV species","limits of detection","published genome sequences of human","assay\u0027s clinical performance","pneumonia patients","aerosol samples","positive samples","severe morbidity","Sanger sequencing","STUDY DESIGN","assay\u0027s target amplicon","natural hosts","decades","COVID","large panel","RESULTS","live bird market","molecular diagnostic tool","novel coronaviruses","cross-reactivity","better understanding","reaction","sample types","BACKGROUND","animals","amplicons","copies","CONCLUSIONS","threats","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

In order to shed more light on these processes, two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and MALDI-TOF tandem mass spectrometry were used to determine the proteome response of the HeLa cell line to persistent LCMV infection. Quantitative analysis revealed 24 differentially abundant proteins. Functional analysis showed that LCMV-responsive proteins were primarily involved in metabolism, stress, and the defense response. Among identified proteins, we discovered significant changes for peroxiredoxins, a family of antioxidant enzymes. Decreased amount of these antioxidant proteins correlated with elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in infected cells. Increased levels of ROS were accompanied by changes in the pattern of telomere restriction fragments (TRFs) in infected cells and mediated activation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways. Moreover, treatment with antioxidants resulted in reduced levels of viral nucleoprotein, indicating a connection between ROS-dependent signaling and viral replication.","publish_time":"2019-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benej, Martin; Danchenko, Maksym; Oveckova, Ingrid; Cervenak, Filip; Tomaska, Lubomir; Grossmannova, Katarina; Polcicova, Katarina; Golias, Tereza; Tomaskova, Jana","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c79cfa0bb8017217a2626f1b4aafdfdab162a8ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6823195.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31708904/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antioxidant proteins","LCMV-responsive proteins","abundant proteins","identified proteins","persistent LCMV infection","persistent infection","infected cells","ROS-dependent","Increased levels of ROS","regulatory cellular processes","cellular functions","significant changes","reduced levels of viral nucleoprotein","cell homeostasis","proteome response","viral replication","Functional analysis","Quantitative analysis","defense response","HeLa cell line","family of antioxidant enzymes","TRFs","mediated activation of hypoxia","elevation of reactive oxygen species","inducible transcription factor","gel electrophoresis","pattern of telomere restriction fragments","MALDI-TOF tandem mass spectrometry","D-DIGE","two-dimensional differential","peroxiredoxins","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","PI3K","HIF","light","survival","metabolism","antioxidants","connection","Akt","kinase","phosphatidylinositol","stress","treatment","Experimental data","pathways"],"language":"en"},

Importantly, our results suggested that MERS-CoV efficiently infected T cells from the peripheral blood and from human lymphoid organs, including the spleen and the tonsil. We further demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection induced apoptosis in T cells, which involved the activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Remarkably, immunostaining of spleen sections from MERS-CoV\u2013infected common marmosets demonstrated the presence of viral nucleoprotein in their CD3(\u002B) T cells. Overall, our results suggested that the unusual capacity of MERS-CoV to infect T cells and induce apoptosis might partly contribute to the high pathogenicity of the virus.","publish_time":"2016-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chu, Hin; Zhou, Jie; Wong, Bosco Ho-Yin; Li, Cun; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Cheng, Zhong-Shan; Yang, Dong; Wang, Dong; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Li, Chuangen; Yeung, Man-Lung; Cai, Jian-Piao; Chan, Ivy Hau-Yee; Ho, Wai-Kuen; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Yao, Yanfeng; Qin, Chuan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8151dfc9e043b28e50d9e8614d11fa3768b50b79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107330.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiv380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26203058/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infection","MERS coronavirus","infected T cells","human primary T cells","dendritic cells","unusual capacity of MERS","human macrophages","results","human lymphoid organs","intrinsic apoptosis pathways","infected common marmosets","immunostaining of spleen sections","peripheral blood","presence of viral nucleoprotein","CD3","Middle East respiratory syndrome","activation","interplay","cytokine dysregulation","disease pathogenesis","high pathogenicity","mortality rate","tonsil"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately CQ did not show efficacy in inhibiting viral replication in a mouse SARS -CoV model [3]. Nevertheless, by considering its anti -inflammatory properties, it has been postulated that CQ/HCQ may have some effect on SARS [3, 4], in particular by inhibiting the production of pro -inflammatory cytokines (TNF \u03B1, IL6 ) and consequently blocking the subsequent cascade of events which lead to ARDS [4].

The present study investigates outcomes with respect to cardiopulmonary arrest rates in institutions with and without rapid response systems (RRSs) and the current level of cardiopulmonary arrest rate in tertiary hospitals. METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on data from 14 tertiary hospitals. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) rate reports were obtained from each hospital to include the number of cardiopulmonary arrest events in adult patients in the general ward, the annual adult admission statistics, and the structure of the RRS if present. RESULTS: Hospitals with RRSs showed a statistically significant reduction of the CPR rate between 2013 and 2015 (odds ratio [OR], 0.731; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.577 to 0.927; P = 0.009). Nevertheless, CPR rates of 2013 and 2015 did not change in hospitals without RRS (OR, 0.988; 95% CI, 0.868 to 1.124; P = 0.854). National university-affiliated hospitals showed less cardiopulmonary arrest rate than private university-affiliated in 2015 (1.92 vs. 2.40; OR, 0.800; 95% CI, 0.702 to 0.912; P = 0.001). High-volume hospitals showed lower cardiopulmonary arrest rates compared with medium-volume hospitals in 2013 (1.76 vs. 2.63; OR, 0.667; 95% CI, 0.577 to 0.772; P \u003C 0.001) and in 2015 (1.55 vs. 3.20; OR, 0.485; 95% CI, 0.428 to 0.550; P \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RRSs may be a feasible option to reduce the CPR rate. The discrepancy in cardiopulmonary arrest rates suggests further research should include a nationwide survey to tease out factors involved in in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest and differences in outcomes based on hospital characteristics.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Yeonhee; Ahn, Jong-Joon; Kang, Byung Ju; Lee, Young Seok; Ha, Sang-Ook; Min, Jin-Soo; Cho, Woo-Hyun; Na, Se-Hee; Lee, Dong-Hyun; Park, Seung-Yong; Hong, Goo-Hyeon; Kim, Hyun-Jung; Shim, Sangwoo; Kim, Jung-Hyun; Lee, Seok-Jeong; Park, So-Young; Moon, Jae Young","journal":"Korean J Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25c88fafba786f31d034614ba0f6efce5c687594.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6786727.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4266/kjccm.2017.00024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31723641/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hospital cardiopulmonary arrest","incidence of cardiopulmonary arrest","lower cardiopulmonary arrest rates","Cardiopulmonary resuscitation","current level of cardiopulmonary arrest rate","number of cardiopulmonary arrest events","tertiary hospitals","CPR rates","High-volume hospitals","rate reports","RRSs","medium-volume hospitals","National university-affiliated hospitals","outcomes","hospital characteristics","present study","adult patients","private university","retrospective study","annual adult admission statistics","general ward","institutions","respect","signs","differences","structure","research","symptoms of clinical deterioration","rapid response systems","feasible option","significant reduction","Early recognition","factors","data","BACKGROUND","nationwide survey","discrepancy","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","confidence interval","RESULTS","odds ratio"],"language":"en"},

Despite compelling evidence that proper hand washing can reduce the transmission of pathogens to patients and the spread of antimicrobial resistance, the adherence of health care workers to recommended hand-hygiene practices has remained unacceptably low. One of the key elements in improving hand-hygiene practice is the use of an alcohol-based hand rub instead of washing with soap and water. An alcohol-based hand rub requires less time, is microbiologically more effective, and is less irritating to skin than traditional hand washing with soap and water. Therefore, alcohol-based hand rubs should replace hand washing as the standard for hand hygiene in health care settings in all situations in which the hands are not visibly soiled. It is also important to change gloves between each patient contact and to use hand-hygiene procedures after glove removal. Reducing health care-associated infections requires that health care workers take responsibility for ensuring that hand hygiene becomes an everyday part of patient care.","publish_time":"2004-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trampuz, Andrej; Widmer, Andreas F.","journal":"Mayo Clinic Proceedings","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9d9fca4fb167b81456adbef78d4ff7be77d8b8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094481.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619611632631; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619611632631","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hand hygiene","hand-hygiene procedures","hand-hygiene practices","traditional hand washing","proper hand washing","alcohol-based hand rubs","health care settings","patient care","Health care-associated infections","adherence of health care workers","soap","water","use","patient contact","standard","spread of antimicrobial resistance","patients","skin","responsibility","transmission of pathogens","situations","compelling evidence","glove removal","time","greatest challenges of modern medicine","key elements","gloves","hands"],"language":"en"},

In this study, in vivo and in vitro experiments investigated the role of reactive glial cells in recruitment and survival of B-lineage cells in response to (murine cytomegalovirus) MCMV infection. METHODS: Flow cytometric analysis was used to assess chemokine receptor expression on brain-infiltrating B cells. Real-time RT-PCR and ELISA were used to measure chemokine levels. Dual-immunohistochemical staining was used to co-localize chemokine production by reactive glia. Primary glial cell cultures and migration assays were used to examine chemokine-mediated recruitment. Astrocyte: B cell co-cultures were used to investigate survival and proliferation. RESULTS: The chemokine receptors CXCR3, CXCR5, CCR5, and CCR7 were detected on CD19(\u002B) cells isolated from the brain during MCMV infection. In particular, CXCR3 was found to be elevated on an increasing number of cells over the time course of infection, and it was the primary chemokine receptor expressed at 60 days post infection Quite different expression kinetics were observed for CXCR5, CCR5, and CCR7, which were elevated on the highest number of cells early during infection and decreased by 14, 30, and 60 days post infection Correspondingly, elevated levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL13, as well as CCL5, were found within the brains of infected animals, and only low levels of CCL3 and CCL19 were detected. Differential expression of CXCL9/CXCL10 and CXCL13 between microglia and astrocytes was apparent, and B cells moved towards supernatants from MCMV-infected microglia, but not astrocytes. Pretreatment with neutralizing Abs to CXCL9 and CXCL10 inhibited this migration. In contrast, neutralizing Abs to the ligand of CXCR5 (i.e., CXCL13) did not significantly block chemotaxis. Proliferation of brain-infiltrating B cells was detected at 7 days post infection and persisted through the latest time tested (60 days post infection). Finally, astrocytes produce BAFF (B cell activating factor of the TNF family) and promote proliferation of B cells via cell-to-cell contact. CONCLUSIONS: CXCR3 is the primary chemokine receptor on CD19(\u002B) B cells persisting within the brain, and migration to microglial cell supernatants is mediated through this receptor. Correspondingly, microglial cells produce CXCL9 and CXCL10, but not CXCL13.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To test a dose\u2010tapering regimen and assess efficacy and clinical safety for up to 18 weeks. ANIMALS: Eighty\u2010eight client\u2010owned cats with feline hypersensitivity dermatitis. METHODS: Cats that received either a placebo or ciclosporin at 2.5 mg/kg or 7 mg/kg daily for 6 weeks were given 7 mg/kg ciclosporin daily for 4 weeks. Depending on the clinical response, the dose was tapered from daily to every other day over the next 4 weeks and further to twice a week for an additional 4 weeks. RESULTS: After all cats received 7 mg/kg for 4 weeks, the dose could be tapered to every other day for the next 4 weeks in 70% of cats remaining in the study. During the next 4 weeks, 57, 15 and 22% of cats remaining in the study could be treated at twice a week, every other day or daily, respectively. After the first 4 weeks, the mean lesion score and owner\u2010assessed pruritus improved over baseline by 69 and 61%, respectively, and remained stable during the following 8 weeks. Approximately 65% of the cats in the study were reported to have an adverse event (AE), very often mild and resolving spontaneously. The most frequent AEs were gastrointestinal and included primarily vomiting and diarrhoea. Eighty per cent of AEs occurred when cats were on daily treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Results suggest that the induction dose of 7 mg/kg ciclosporin can be tapered as soon as 4 weeks without deterioration of the clinical response. Establishment of the lowest effective dosing regimen of ciclosporin reduced the frequency of AEs.","publish_time":"2013-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Steffan, Jean; Roberts, Elizabeth; Cannon, Andrea; Pr\u00E9laud, Pascal; Forsythe, Peter; Fontaine, Jacques; King, Stephen; Seewald, Wolfgang","journal":"Vet Dermatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/60660ced1fb008a0fa92152b36b171e8073706ed.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169265.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/vde.12018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["weeks","ciclosporin dose","clinical response","owned cats","daily treatment","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","clinical safety","induction dose","study","day","lowest effective dosing regimen of ciclosporin","treatment of feline hypersensitivity dermatitis","RESULTS","frequency of AEs","frequent AEs","cent of AEs","owner","client","mean lesion score","Little information","pruritus","Establishment","efficacy","BACKGROUND","ANIMALS","CONCLUSIONS","deterioration","adverse event","baseline","OBJECTIVES","placebo","HYPOTHESIS","diarrhoea","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We sought to characterize their perceptions and identify reasons underlying inappropriate use. Methods We conducted 12 focus groups with nurses and nursing assistants at 4 medical centers. We analyzed the thematic content of 73 discrete \u201Cstories\u201D told by focus group participants. Results We identified 5 story types surrounding RPE use: 1) policies are known and seen during work routines; 2) during protocol lapses, use is reinforced through social norms; 3) clinical experiences sometimes supersede protocol adherence; 4) when risk perception is high, we found concern regarding accessing RPE; and 5) HCWs in emergency departments were viewed as not following protocol because risk was ever-present. Discussion HCWs were aware of the importance of RPE and protocols for using it, and these supported use when protocol lapses occurred. However, protocol adherence was undermined by clinical experience, perceived risk, and the distinct context of the emergency department where patients continually arrive with incomplete or delayed diagnoses. Conclusions Protocols, visual cues, and social norms contribute to a culture of safety. This culture can be undermined when HCWs experience diagnostic uncertainty or they mistrust the protocol and instead rely on their clinical experiences.","publish_time":"2019-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fix, Gemmae M.; Reisinger, Heather Schacht; Etchin, Anna; McDannold, Sarah; Eagan, Aaron; Findley, Kimberly; Gifford, Allen L.; Gupta, Kalpana; McInnes, D.

To identify and characterize the field PEDVs associated with the outbreaks of severe diarrhea in piglets in Jiangxi, 2013, the complete genome sequences of two representative strains of PEDV, designated CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013, were determined and analyzed. The genome sequences of both emergent Jiangxi PEDV strains, CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013, were 28,038 nucleotides in length excluding 3\u2019 poly (A) tail. Compared to the PEDV CV777 strain, CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 had some unique genetic characteristics in the proximal region of the 5\u00B4-UTRs. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomes and the structural proteins revealed that CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 had a close relationship with post-2010 Chinese PEDV strains and US strains identified in 2013. The nucleotide identity between the two Jiangxi strains (CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013) and 30 strains of PEDV identified ante-2010 and post-2010 ranged from 96.3\u201397.0% and 97.3\u201399.7%, respectively. Multiple nucleotide and deduced amino acid mutations were observed in the ORF1a/b, S, ORF3, E, M and N genes among the current field PEDV strains when compared to the CV777 strain. Some of the mutations altered the amino acid charge and hydrophilicity, and notably, there was an amino acid substitution in the middle of one neutralizing epitope (L1371I) of the S gene of both CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013. Taken together, the accumulated genetic variations of the current field PEDV strains might have led to antigenic changes of the viruses, which might confer the less effectiveness or failure of the CV777-based vaccines currently being widely used in Jiangxi, China.","publish_time":"2015-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Deping; Huang, Dongyan; Peng, Qi; Huang, Tao; Chen, Yanjun; Zhang, Tiansheng; Nie, Xiaowei; He, Houjun; Wang, Ping; Liu, Qinglan; Tang, Yuxin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d2bd0d04e9e4418d308e40557a3c397eaada71d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4366183.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25790462/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0120310","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","CH/JX"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["JX","designated CH","Jiangxi strains","Chinese PEDV strains","representative strains of PEDV","emergent Jiangxi PEDV strains","current field PEDV strains","US strains","PEDV CV777 strain","watery diarrhea","amino acid substitution","amino acid charge","deduced amino acid mutations","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","complete genome sequences","outbreaks of severe diarrhea","field PEDVs","CV777-based vaccines","complete genomes","S gene","Multiple nucleotide","nucleotide identity","accumulated genetic variations","unique genetic characteristics","vomiting","middle","acute enteric viral disease of swine","N genes","close relationship","L1371I","ORF3","ORF1a","structural proteins","proximal region","neutralizing epitope","failure","dehydration","piglets","antigenic changes","poly","Phylogenetic analysis","death","nucleotides","hydrophilicity","ante","length","viruses","effectiveness","tail","UTRs","China"],"language":"en"},

Twenty three calves from BCV-free herds were randomly divided into control and several treatment groups. All calves were orally challenged with 1 \u00D7 109 TCID50 of the virulent Kakegawa strain of BCV at 24 to 36 h after birth. Calves in treatment groups received either egg yolk powder or cow colostrum containing BCV specific antibodies. Daily treatment with these antibody preparations started 6 h until 7 days post-challenge. Control calves which received no antibody had severe diarrhea and all died within 6 days after infection. In contrast, calves fed milk containing egg yolk or colostrum with neutralization titers of 1:2560 or 1:10 240 respectively all survived and had positive weight gain unlike the other treatment groups. These results indicate that the orally administered egg yolk and colostrum powders protected against BCV-induced diarrhea in neonatal calves and that the egg yolk used provided a higher degree of protection compared to colostrum powder on a titer basis. Treatment with whole egg yolk from immunized hens therefore provides a more efficacious alternative to the existing methods of specific passive protection against BCV.","publish_time":"1997-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ikemori, Yutaka; Ohta, Masashi; Umeda, Kouji; Icatlo, Faustino C.; Kuroki, Masahiko; Yokoyama, Hideaki; Kodama, Yoshikatsu","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02f3d456efc7278f0e297bac239fe7983c2eea89.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113597001442; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113597001442","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["egg yolk powder","administered egg yolk","treatment groups","Control calves","virulent BCV strain","colostrum powders","protective effect of egg yolk","neonatal calves","BCV specific antibodies","BCV-induced diarrhea","cow colostrum","BCV-free herds","virulent Kakegawa strain of BCV","Daily treatment","days post-challenge","immunized hens","challenge model","antibody preparations","severe diarrhea","existing methods of specific passive protection","higher degree of protection","antigen","cows","inactivated bovine coronavirus","efficacious alternative","milk","positive weight gain","neutralization titers","TCID50","titer basis","contrast","results","infection","birth"],"language":"en"},

This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice. METHODS: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms \u201CCOVID-19\u201D, \u201CSARS-CoV-2\u201D in conjunction with \u201Cotorhinolaryngological manifestation\u201D, \u201CENT\u201D, and \u201Colfaction\u201D. RESULTS: The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19. During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed. Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krajewska, Joanna; Krajewski, Wojciech; Zub, Krzysztof; Zato\u0144ski, Tomasz","journal":"Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8fec1c0fef4c5368e1489bbacac569c68845b2ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166003.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-05968-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306118/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["URT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential COVID","confirmed COVID","common symptoms of COVID","development of severe COVID","ENT symptoms","common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID","SARS-CoV","younger patients","anosmia","ENT surgeons","sore throat","urgent ENT surgeries","cough","dyspnea","molecular confirmation of SARS","URT","Otorhinolaryngological manifestations","otolaryngologist practice","potential treatment","isolated sudden hyposmia","glasses","diagnosis","fluid resistant gloves","clinical characteristics","N95 mask","precise review","gown","disease transmission","related information useful","region","nose","time limit","current knowledge","history of travel","Web of Science databases","Medline","nasal congestion","dizziness","FFP3","great risk","Upper respiratory tract","PURPOSE","pandemic","Rhinorrhea","study","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","terms","conjunction","surgery","Additional studies","METHODS","Otolaryngologists","individuals","mechanism","cases","research","olfaction","article"],"language":"en"},

Farm characteristics, animal factors and management practices were also assessed for any association with calf scours being present on the farm. METHODS: A questionnaire and return address envelope were distributed to 721 farms with at least 50 head of beef cattle in the Hume area of New South Wales, Australia. RESULTS: In total, 147 (20.4%) farmers responded to the survey, of which 76 (51.7%) indicated calf scours did occur on their farm. On average, farmers estimated the morbidity of calf scours was 4.5%, but only 0.2% of all calves died as a result of scours. Affected herds were more likely to have multiple breeds and a higher proportion of cows with mismothering problems or weak calves compared with unaffected herds. These differences were confirmed with regression analysis. A large proportion of farmers with affected herds reported the loss of many calves from \u2018unexplained\u2019 or \u2018sudden\u2019 death within the first 14 days of life. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of calf morbidity was lower and mortality was within the same range compared with other studies on beef farms around the world.

In the present study, the complete genome sequence of Newbury1 was determined and classified Newbury1 in a new genus of the Caliciviridae. The Newbury1 genome, of 7454 nucleotides, had two predicted open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encoded the non-structural and contiguous capsid proteins. ORF2 encoded a basic protein characteristic of the family Caliciviridae. Compared to the 4 recognized Caliciviridae genera, Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus and Vesivirus, Newbury1 had less than 39% amino acid (47% nucleotide) identity in the complete 2C-helicase, 3C-protease, 3D-polymerase and capsid regions but had 89% to 98% amino acid (78% to 92% nucleotide) identity to the recently characterized NB virus in these regions. By phylogenetic analyses, Newbury1 and NB viruses formed a distinct clade independent of the 4 recognized genera. However, amino acid identities showed that Newbury1 and the NB virus were distinct polymerase types (90% amino acid identity), but their complete capsid proteins were almost identical (98% amino acid identity). Analyses of contemporary viruses showed that the two polymerase genotypes, Newbury1 and NB, were circulating in UK cattle and antibody to Newbury1-like viruses was common in cattle sera. The present study defined the existence of a new genus in the Caliciviridae that we propose be named Becovirus or Nabovirus to distinguish the new clade from bovine noroviruses.","publish_time":"2006-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oliver, S.

Previous studies have investigated the risk of acute respiratory illness (ARI) after influenza vaccination with conflicting results. We assessed whether there is an increased rate of laboratory-confirmed ARI in post-influenza vaccination periods. Methods We conducted a cohort sub-analysis of children and adults in the MoSAIC community surveillance study from 2013 to 2016. Influenza vaccination was confirmed through city or hospital registries. Cases of ARI were ascertained by twice-weekly text messages to household to identify members with ARI symptoms. Nasal swabs were obtained from ill participants and analyzed for respiratory pathogens using multiplex PCR. The primary outcome measure was the hazard ratio of laboratory-confirmed ARI in individuals post-vaccination compared to other time periods during three influenza seasons. Results Of the 999 participants, 68.8% were children, 30.2% were adults. Each study season, approximately half received influenza vaccine and one third experienced \u22651 ARI. The hazard of influenza in individuals during the 14-day post-vaccination period was similar to unvaccinated individuals during the same period (HR 0.96, 95% CI [0.60, 1.52]). The hazard of non-influenza respiratory pathogens was higher during the same period (HR 1.65, 95% CI [1.14, 2.38]); when stratified by age the hazard remained higher for children (HR 1\u00B771, 95% CI [1.16, 2.53]) but not for adults (HR 0.88, 95% CI [0.21, 3.69]). Conclusion Among children there was an increase in the hazard of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period. Potential mechanisms for this association warrant further investigation. Future research could investigate whether medical decision-making surrounding influenza vaccination may be improved by acknowledging patient experiences, counseling regarding different types of ARI, and correcting the misperception that all ARI occurring after vaccination are caused by influenza.","publish_time":"2018-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rikin, Sharon; Jia, Haomiao; Vargas, Celibell Y.; Castellanos de Belliard, Yaritza; Reed, Carrie; LaRussa, Philip; Larson, Elaine L.; Saiman, Lisa; Stockwell, Melissa S.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83893cafe53fc26b47974495bb1cd9511f34fecc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115556.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.02.105; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X18303153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29525279/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18303153","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs4OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hazard of influenza","influenza vaccine","post-influenza vaccination periods","hazard of ARI","influenza seasons","non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination","hazard of non-influenza respiratory pathogens","individuals post-vaccination","medical decision-making surrounding influenza vaccination","ARI symptoms","Cases of ARI","day post-vaccination period","HR","different types of ARI","unvaccinated children","adults","hazard ratio of laboratory","unvaccinated individuals","cohort sub-analysis of children","misperception","risk of acute respiratory illness","time periods","ill participants","inactivated vaccine","study season","conflicting results","increased rate of laboratory","MoSAIC community surveillance study","household","members","counseling","barrier","patient experiences","primary outcome measure","weekly text messages","city","Abstract Background","Future research","association","Methods","Nasal swabs","multiplex PCR","Potential mechanisms","Previous studies","hospital registries","investigation","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

We previously reported the successful in vitro inhibition of FIPV replication by synthetic siRNA mediated RNA interference (RNAi) in an immortalised cell line (McDonagh et al., 2011). A major challenge facing the development of any antiviral strategy is that of resistance, a problem which is particularly acute for RNAi based therapeutics due to the exquisite sequence specificity of the targeting mechanism. The development of resistance during treatment can be minimised using combination therapy to raise the genetic barrier or using highly potent compounds which result in a more rapid and pronounced reduction in the viral replication rate, thereby reducing the formation of mutant, and potentially resistant viruses. This study investigated the efficacy of combination siRNA therapy and its ability to delay or prevent viral escape. Virus serially passaged through cells treated with a single or dual siRNAs rapidly acquired resistance, with mutations identified in the siRNA target sites. Combination therapy with three siRNA prevented viral escape over the course of five passages. To identify more potent silencing molecules we also compared the efficacy, in terms of potency and duration of action, of canonical versus Dicer-substrate siRNAs for two previously identified effective viral motifs. Dicer-substrate siRNAs showed equivalent or better potency than canonical siRNAs for the target sites investigated, and may be a more appropriate molecule for in vivo use. Combined, these data inform the potential therapeutic application of antiviral RNAi against FIPV.","publish_time":"2015-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"McDonagh, Phillip; Sheehy, Paul A.; Norris, Jacqueline M.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7894828dd97b37f21d3b93ab0c32d8e29418047.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117502.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25596968/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.12.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113514005823; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113514005823","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["canonical siRNAs","efficacy of combination siRNA therapy","combination therapy","viral escape","development of resistance","Dicer-substrate siRNAs","siRNA target sites","dual siRNAs","development of feline infectious peritonitis","viral replication rate","effective antiviral treatment","effective viral motifs","feline infectious peritonitis virus","inhibition of FIPV replication","antiviral strategy","synthetic siRNA mediated RNA interference","potential therapeutic application of antiviral RNAi","better potency","terms of potency","potent compounds","Abstract Virulent biotypes of feline coronavirus","potent silencing molecules","fatal immune mediated disease","exquisite sequence specificity","therapeutics","genetic barrier","mutations","ability","duration of action","immortalised cell line","targeting mechanism","FCoV","reduction","course","formation of mutant","McDonagh","data","cells","problem","study","resistant viruses","major challenge","appropriate molecule","passages"],"language":"en"},

First, the merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), a major asexual blood stage antigen that is currently considered a strong vaccine candidate. Second, the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a component of sporozoites that contains a B-cell epitope. METHODS: A synthetic chimeric recombinant 516 bp gene encoding containing PvMSP-1, a Pro-Gly linker motif, and PvCSP was synthesized; the gene, named MLC, encoded a total of 172 amino acids. The recombinant gene was modified with regard to codon usage to optimize gene expression in Brassica napus. The Ti plasmid inducible gene transfer system was used for MLC chimeric recombinant gene expression in B. napus. Gene expression was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), beta-glucuronidase reporter gene (GUS) assay, and Western blot. RESULTS: The MLC chimeric recombinant protein expressed in B. napus had a molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa. It exhibited a clinical sensitivity of 84.21% (n = 38) and a clinical specificity of 100% (n = 24) as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Oral immunization of BALB/c mice with MLC chimeric recombinant protein successfully induced antigen-specific IgG1 production. Additionally, the Th1-related cytokines IL-12 (p40), TNF, and IFN-\u03B3 were significantly increased in the spleens of the BALB/c mice. CONCLUSIONS: The chimeric MLC recombinant protein produced in B. napus has potential as both as an antigen for diagnosis and as a valuable vaccine candidate for oral immunization against vivax malaria.","publish_time":"2011-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Choonghee; Kim, Hyung-Hwan; Mi Choi, Kyung; Won Chung, Kyung; Choi, Yien Kyoung; Jang, Mi Jung; Kim, Tong-Soo; Chung, Nam-Jun; Rhie, Ho-Gun; Lee, Ho-Sa; Sohn, Youngjoo; Kim, Hyuck; Lee, Sung-Jae; Lee, Hyeong-Woo","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3240298a10e4834230eabe0b7cb5a728c00779af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3098821.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-10-106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21529346/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BALB"],"locations":["Brassica"],"keyphrases":["MLC chimeric recombinant gene expression","MLC chimeric recombinant protein","chimeric MLC recombinant protein","synthetic chimeric recombinant","bp gene encoding","circumsporozoite protein","beta-glucuronidase reporter gene","Brassica napus","vivax candidate proteins","valuable vaccine candidate","merozoite surface protein","strong vaccine candidate","Ti plasmid inducible gene transfer system","Plasmodium vivax","c mice","vivax malaria","Oral immunization of BALB","plant-based vaccine","antigen-specific IgG1 production","clinical sensitivity","clinical specificity","major asexual blood stage antigen","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","GUS","PCR","PvMSP","polymerase chain reaction","p40","PvCSP","codon usage","regard","Pro-Gly linker motif","ELISA","component of sporozoites","spleens","diagnosis","Th1-related cytokines IL","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","B-cell epitope","IFN-\u03B3","TNF","Western blot","molecular weight","total","METHODS","potential","amino acids","kDa","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

With ongoing climate change there is an increasing need to understand the effect changes in temperature may have on emerging infectious disease. We investigated whether species\u2019 susceptibilities change with temperature and ask if susceptibility is greatest at different temperatures in different species. We infected 45 species of Drosophilidae with an RNA virus and measured how viral load changes with temperature. We found the host phylogeny explained a large proportion of the variation in viral load at each temperature, with strong phylogenetic correlations between viral loads across temperature. The variance in viral load increased with temperature, whilst the mean viral load did not, such that as temperature increased the most susceptible species become more susceptible, and the least susceptible less so. We found no significant relationship between a species\u2019 susceptibility across temperatures and proxies for thermal optima; critical thermal maximum and minimum or basal metabolic rate. These results suggest that whilst the rank order of species susceptibilities can remain the same with changes in temperature, the likelihood of host shifts into a given species may increase or decrease. Emerging infectious diseases are often the result of a host shift, where a pathogen jumps from one host species into another. Understanding the factors underlying host shifts is a major goal for infectious disease researchers. This effort has been further complicated by the fact that host-parasite interactions are now taking place in a period of unprecedented global climatic warming. Here, we ask how host shifts are affected by temperature by carrying out experimental infections using an RNA virus across a wide range of related species, at three different temperatures. We find that as temperature increases the most susceptible species become more susceptible, and the least susceptible less so. This has important consequences for our understanding of host shift events in a changing climate, and suggests that temperature changes may affect the likelihood of a host shift into certain species.","publish_time":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roberts, Katherine E.; Hadfield, Jarrod D.; Sharma, Manmohan D.; Longdon, Ben","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2edea7e259c872d2b0412a8ffa2511a18109ed13.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b9b0cad2db02479624a3d087626811e4d2fbcdb9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/358564","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different host species","susceptible species","temperature changes","different species","host phylogeny","likelihood of host shifts","certain species","given species","species of Drosophilidae","host-parasite interactions","viral load changes","understanding of host shift events","different temperatures","rank order of species susceptibilities","mean viral load","wide range of related species","viral loads","infectious disease researchers","Emerging infectious diseases","important source of emerging infectious disease","effect changes","RNA virus","pathogen jumps","species\u2019 susceptibility","species\u2019 susceptibilities","ongoing climate change","thermal optima","changing climate","important consequences","critical thermal maximum","proxies","major goal","strong phylogenetic correlations","increasing need","large proportion","place","basal metabolic rate","variation","period of unprecedented global climatic warming","experimental infections","significant relationship","factors","variance","results","effort"],"language":"en"},

Recent theoretical work has focused on making best use of data from the initial exponential phase of growth of incidence in large populations. METHODS: We measured generational transmissibility by the basic reproductive number R(0) and the serial interval by its mean T(g). First, we constructed a simulation algorithm for case data arising from a small population of known size with R(0) and T(g) also known. We then developed an inferential model for the likelihood of these case data as a function of R(0) and T(g). The model was designed to capture a) any signal of the serial interval distribution in the initial stochastic phase b) the growth rate of the exponential phase and c) the unique combination of R(0) and T(g) that generates a specific shape of peak incidence when the susceptible portion of a small population is depleted. FINDINGS: Extensive repeat simulation and parameter estimation revealed no bias in univariate estimates of either R(0) and T(g). We were also able to simultaneously estimate both R(0) and T(g). However, accurate final estimates could be obtained only much later in the outbreak. In particular, estimates of T(g) were considerably less accurate in the bivariate case until the peak of incidence had passed. CONCLUSIONS: The basic reproductive number and mean serial interval can be estimated simultaneously in real time during an outbreak of an emerging pathogen. Repeated application of these methods to small scale outbreaks at the start of an epidemic would permit accurate estimates of key parameters.","publish_time":"2016-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Kendra M.; Riley, Steven","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc66ac23fd5a72e5bf95bad4be77eb93527562d9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4744020.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0148061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26849644/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM4LmNzdjs5NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1667702,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CHfPhmNf8n0tOhQ6IDeqOA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_38.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mean T","function of R","mean serial interval","serial interval distribution","basic reproductive number R","case data","unique combination of R","accurate final estimates","peak of incidence","univariate estimates","initial exponential phase of growth","accurate estimates of key parameters","bivariate case","small population of known size","METHODS","initial stochastic phase b","specific shape of peak incidence","small scale outbreaks","best use of data","growth rate","generational transmissibility","emerging pathogen","simulation algorithm","inferential model","novel human pathogen","Extensive repeat simulation","parameter estimation","public health priority","bias","susceptible portion","timing","start","epidemic","FINDINGS","likelihood","Repeated application","large populations","Recent theoretical work","real time","CONCLUSIONS","signal","strength of interventions","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

If the clinical signs and diagnostic methods fail to correlate, the veterinarian should work with the diagnostic laboratory to solve the diagnostic puzzle.","publish_time":"2008-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kapil, Sanjay; Yeary, Teresa; Johnson, Bill","journal":"Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/558d584017b56dfcdd78a431ffee95d4cdf0232b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114727.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18501276/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cvsm.2008.02.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195561608000727; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195561608000727","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emerging viruses","diagnostic methods","diagnostic laboratory","diagnostic puzzle","accurate detection of emerging diseases of small animals","nature of virus","immune response","origin","clinical signs","authors","problem","Veterinarians","practice","article","host"],"language":"en"},

However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient\u2019s persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff. Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gornet, Jean-Marc; Linh Tran Minh, My; Leleu, Florian; Hassid, Deborah","journal":"J Visc Surg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3a1699f0d287bdf87132875b16c53a56a8d9d5d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878788620301235?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2020.04.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360205/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878788620301235","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs5OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASAT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cases of persistent digestive symptoms","pulmonary symptoms","digestive endoscopy","digestive pathology","infection","Digestive forms","severe COVID","half of patients","stools","hand","diarrhea","doubtful cases","event of prolonged viral shedding","abdominal pain","patient\u2019s persistent contagiousness","pulmonary images compatible","Thoraco-abdominal scan","elevated CRP","lymphopenia","object","virologic assessment of stool samples","early stage","undetected pauci-symptomatic members","negative throat swab","longer duration","heightened ASAT transaminases","ENT level","health care staff","fever","dry cough","surgical activity","dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement","means","lung injury","Fecal-oral transmission","definitive diagnosis","significant risk of contamination","Resumption of medico","triad","dyspnea","leading clinical sign","identification","nausea","main biological abnormalities","epidemic","anorexia","coronavirus","endoscopic surgeons","Upcoming serology","prognosis","extent","fact","data"],"language":"en"},

Protective effect on kidney was also monitored histopathologically and biochemically through observing the levels of LDH, creatinine, creatinine-kinase, urea and uric acid. The combinations of HF and GL showed protective effect more than the used single doses of HF and GL alone. However, SI was superior to the used combination in the two used doses in all the measured parameters. The liver and kidney cells appearance under normal and electron microscope showed that SI treated groups showed almost normal cells with slight toxic signs.

Increased circulating ACE2 predicts adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF), but it is unknown if elevated plasma ACE2 activity predicts major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: We prospectively recruited patients with obstructive CAD (defined as \u226550% stenosis of the left main coronary artery and/or \u226570% stenosis in \u2265 1 other major epicardial vessel on invasive coronary angiography) and measured plasma ACE2 activity.

RESULTS: We recruited 79 patients with obstructive coronary artery disease. The median (IQR) plasma ACE2 activity was 29.3 pmol/ml/min [21.2\u201341.2]. Over a median follow up of 10.5 years [9.6\u201310.8years], MACE occurred in 46% of patients (36 events).

Angiopoietins, vascular-specific growth factors, are linked to endothelial barrier dysfunction, and elevated Angiopoietin-2 (ANG2) levels are associated with poor outcome of ALI patients. Specialized immune cells, referred to as \u2018TIE2-expressing monocytes and macrophages\u2019 (TEM), were shown to specifically respond to ANG2 binding. However, their involvement in acute inflammatory processes is so far completely undescribed. Thus, our aim was to assess the dynamics of TEMs in a murine model of ALI. RESULTS: Intratracheal instillation of LPS induced a robust pulmonary pro-inflammatory response with endothelial barrier dysfunction and significantly enhanced ANG2 expression. The percentage number of TEMs, assessed by FACS analysis, was more than trebled compared to controls, with TEM count in lungs reaching more than 40% of all macrophages. Such distinct dynamic was absent in all other analyzed compartments (alveolar space, spleen, blood). Incubation of the monocytic cell line THP-1 with LPS or TNF-\u03B1 resulted in a dose-dependent, significant upregulation of TIE2, suggesting that not recruitment from extra-pulmonary compartments but TIE2 upregulation in resident macrophages accounts for increased lung TEM frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our data provide evidence that the activity of TEMs changes at sites of acute inflammation.

Because all viruses are obligate parasites that require host cells for replication, we globally assessed how IAV1918 induces host protein dysregulation. We performed quantitative mass spectrometry of IAV1918-infected cells to measure host protein dysregulation. Selected proteins were validated by immunoblotting and phosphorylation levels of members of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were assessed. Compared to mock-infected controls, \u003E170 proteins in the IAV1918-infected cells were dysregulated. Proteins mapped to amino sugar metabolism, purine metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, transmembrane receptors, phosphatases and transcription regulation. Immunoblotting demonstrated that IAV1918 induced a slight up-regulation of the lamin B receptor whereas all other tested virus strains induced a significant down-regulation. IAV1918 also strongly induced Rab5b expression whereas all other tested viruses induced minor up-regulation or down-regulation. IAV1918 showed early reduced phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway members and was especially sensitive to rapamycin.

However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications because it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here, we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D(G64S), has a significant replication defect and that wild-type (WT) and 3D(G64S) populations have similar adaptability in 2 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D(G64S) under selection for replicative speed led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D(G64S) exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the lethal level, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D(G64S) growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast with what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within-host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity.","publish_time":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fitzsimmons, William J.; Woods, Robert J.; McCrone, John T.; Woodman, Andrew; Arnold, Jamie J.; Yennawar, Madhumita; Evans, Richard; Cameron, Craig E.; Lauring, Adam S.","journal":"PLoS Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59cdfbf3b9e99d780b3ad6cf2985e34ec61e8f5a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6040757.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6040757/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzExOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G64S","high mutation rates","viral replicative speed","increased replicative speed","compensation","RNA viruses","byproduct of selection","indirect selection","fidelity phenotype","genetic drift","genetic hitchhiking","growth defect","genetic diversity","virulence","physicochemical cost of high fidelity","increased adaptability","alternative model","slower growth","similar adaptability","viral infections","present data","kinetic proofreading model","significant replication defect","observed correlation","reversion","lethal level","attenuation","wild-type","doses","biosynthetic reactions","populations","delayed morbidity","distinct cellular environments","pathogenesis","host spread","relative impact","profound implications","poliovirus antimutator","Experimental evolution","novo mutations","mutational supply","forces","argument","accuracy","Mice","systems","contrast"],"language":"en"},

In this study we developed an algorithm to effectively analyze large-scale oil spill areas in SAR images by focusing on optimizing the input layer to artificial neural network (ANN) through removal the factor of lowering the accuracy. An ANN algorithm was used to generate probability maps of oil spills. Highly accurate pixel-based data processing was conducted through false or un-detection element reduction by normalizing the image or applying a non-local (NL) means filter and median filter to the input neurons for ANN. In addition, the standard deviation of co-polarized phase difference (CPD) was used to reduce false detection from the look-alike with weak damping effect. The algorithm was validated using TerraSAR-X images of an oil spill caused by stranded oil tanker Volganefti-139 in the Kerch Strait in 2007. According to the validation results of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the oil spill was detected with an accuracy of about 95.19% and un-detection or false detection by look-alike and speckle noise was greatly reduced.","publish_time":"2018-07-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Daeseong; Jung, Hyung-Sup","journal":"Sensors (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ae5509495e79b5d077ce582f092950b38982dfa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6069476.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6069476/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzE0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SAR","NL"],"locations":["Kerch Strait"],"keyphrases":["oil-spill areas","false detection","large-scale oil spill areas","stranded oil tanker Volganefti","probability maps of oil spills","ANN algorithm","look-alike","un-detection element reduction","SAR images","accuracy","median filter","input layer","input neurons","backscattering intensity difference","TerraSAR-X images","standard deviation of co-polarized phase difference","artificial neural network","receiver","characteristic","addition","removal","NL","CPD","curve","accurate pixel-based data processing","background pixels","weak damping effect","speckle noise","phenomena","validation results","Synthetic aperture radar","factor","Kerch Strait","positive identification","signal","study"],"language":"en"},

At present, no established biomarkers exist to support diagnosis for respiratory viral infections and more importantly for severe IV disease. Studies in animal models are extremely important to understand the biological, genetic, and environmental factors that contribute to severe IV disease and to validate biomarker candidates from human studies. However, mouse human cross-species comparisons are often compromised by the fact that animal studies concentrate on the infected lungs, whereas in humans almost all studies use peripheral blood from patients. In addition, human studies do not consider genetic background as variable although human populations are genetically very diverse. Therefore, in this study, we performed a cross-species gene expression study of the peripheral blood from human patients and from the highly genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population after IV infection. Our results demonstrate that changes of gene expression in individual genes are highly similar in mice and humans. The top-regulated genes in humans were also differentially regulated in mice. We conclude that the mouse is a highly valuable in vivo model system to validate and to discover gene candidates which can be used as biomarkers in humans. Furthermore, mouse studies allow confirmation of findings in humans in a well-controlled experimental system adding enormous value to the understanding of expression and function of human candidate genes.

However, low efficiency and survival in MSC homing to injured lung tissue remains to be solved. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether large intergenic noncoding RNA (LincRNA)-p21 promote MSC migration and survival capacity through hypoxic preconditioning in vitro. METHODS: MSCs were cultured and divided into the normoxia culture group (20% O2) and hypoxia culture group (1% O2). To determine roles and mechanisms, lentivirus vector-mediated LincRNA-p21 knockdown of MSCs and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1\u03B1) inhibitor KC7F2 were introduced. Additionally, MSC migration was analyzed by scratch test and transwell migration assays. MSC proliferation was tested by cell counting kit-8 and trypan blue dye. Apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-PE/7-AAD stained flow cytometry. Moreover, LincRNA-p21 and HIF-1\u03B1 mRNA was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and HIF-1\u03B1 and CXCR4/7 protein were assayed by western blot (WB) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Apoptosis protein caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 were investigated by WB analysis. Considering interactions between VHL and HIF-1\u03B1 under LincRNA-p21 effect, co-immunoprecipitation was detected. RESULTS: Hypoxic preconditioning MSC promoted migration capacity and MSC survival than normoxia culture group. MSCs induced by hypoxic preconditioning evoked an increase in expression of LincRNA-p21, HIF-1\u03B1, and CXCR4/7(both were chemokine stromal-derived factor-1(SDF-1) receptors). Contrarily, blockade of LincRNA-p21 by shRNA and HIF-1\u03B1 inhibitor KC7F2 abrogated upregulation of hypoxic preconditioning induced CXCR4/7 in MSCs, cell migration, and survival. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that hypoxic preconditioning isolated VHL and HIF-1\u03B1 protein by increasing HIF-1\u03B1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxic preconditioning was identified as a promoting factor of MSC migration and survival capacity. LincRNA-p21 promotes MSC migration and survival capacity through HIF-1\u03B1/CXCR4 and CXCR7 pathway under hypoxic preconditioning in vitro.","publish_time":"2018-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meng, Shan-Shan; Xu, Xiu-Ping; Chang, Wei; Lu, Zhong-Hua; Huang, Li-Li; Xu, Jing-Yuan; Liu, Ling; Qiu, Hai-Bo; Yang, Yi; Guo, Feng-Mei","journal":"Stem Cell Res Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1049562c838f202553d43127e68abe8a2f9d8fea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6202870.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6202870/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MSC","Annexin V-PE","WB","VHL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIF","Hypoxic preconditioning MSC","MSC survival","\u03B1 protein","migration capacity","\u03B1 expression","survival capacity","LincRNA-p21 effect","\u03B1 mRNA","promoting factor of MSC migration","MSC homing","MSC proliferation","cell migration","expression of LincRNA","hypoxic preconditioning isolated VHL","blockade of LincRNA","\u03B1 inhibitor KC7F2 abrogated upregulation of hypoxic preconditioning induced CXCR4","lentivirus vector-mediated LincRNA-p21 knockdown of MSCs","transwell migration assays","hypoxia culture group","normoxia culture group","Apoptosis protein caspase","hypoxia-inducible factor","co-immunoprecipitation assay","O2","chemokine stromal-derived factor","WB analysis","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome","potent stabilizing effects","scratch test","shRNA","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","bone marrow","kit","mechanisms","large intergenic noncoding RNA","CXCR7 pathway","increase","Mesenchymal stem cells","AAD stained flow cytometry","ARDS","Annexin V-PE","ELISA","BACKGROUND","western blot","low efficiency","RESULTS","lung tissue","trypan blue dye","study","roles","SDF","interactions","CONCLUSIONS","aim","receptors","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Growth-based high-throughput screening is concomitant with drug repurposing and enables rapid identification of new therapeutic uses for investigated drugs; however, this traditional method is not compatible with microorganisms with abnormal growth patterns such as Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants (SCV). SCV subpopulations are auxotrophic for key compounds in biosynthetic pathways, which result in low growth rate. SCV formation is also associated with reduced antibiotic susceptibility, and the SCV\u2019s ability to revert to the normal cell growth state is thought to contribute to recurrence of S. aureus infections. Thus, there is a critical need to identify antimicrobial agents that are potent against SCV in order to effectively treat chronic infections. Accordingly, here we describe adapting an adenylate kinase (AK)-based cell death reporter assay to identify members of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library that display bactericidal activity against S. aureus SCV. Four library members, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, exhibited potent SCV bactericidal activity against a stable S. aureus SCV. Further investigation showed that sitafloxacin was potent against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus, as well as S. aureus within an established biofilm. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability to use the AK assay to screen small-molecule libraries for SCV bactericidal agents and highlight the therapeutic potential of sitafloxacin to be repurposed to treat chronic S. aureus infections associated with SCV and/or biofilm growth states. IMPORTANCE Conventional antibiotics fail to successfully treat chronic osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and device-related and airway infections. These recurring infections are associated with the emergence of SCV, which are recalcitrant to conventional antibiotics. Studies have investigated antibiotic therapies to treat SCV-related infections but have had little success, emphasizing the need to identify novel antimicrobial drugs. However, drug discovery is a costly and time-consuming process. An alternative strategy is drug repurposing, which could identify FDA-approved and well-characterized drugs that could have off-label utility in treating SCV. In this study, we adapted a high-throughput AK-based assay to identify 4 FDA-approved drugs, daunorubicin, ketoconazole, rifapentine, and sitafloxacin, which display antimicrobial activity against S. aureus SCV, suggesting an avenue for drug repurposing in order to effectively treat SCV-related infections. Additionally, this screening paradigm can easily be adapted for other drug/chemical libraries to identify compounds bactericidal against SCV.","publish_time":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trombetta, Ryan P.; Dunman, Paul M.; Schwarz, Edward M.; Kates, Stephen L.; Awad, Hani A.","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c615556cb238bad03d0538519159600fe727c903.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6211227.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6211227/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzI5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCV","Food and Drug Administration","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aureus SCV","SCV-related infections","SCV subpopulations","emergence of SCV","SCV formation","aureus infections","SCV bactericidal agents","Drug repurposing","potent SCV bactericidal activity","Drug Administration","drug discovery","chronic infections","approved drug library","traditional drug development","airway infections","recurring infections","FDA-approved drugs","compounds bactericidal","AK assay","antimicrobial activity","investigated drugs","novel antimicrobial drugs","biofilm growth states","high-throughput AK-based assay","Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants","antimicrobial agents","abnormal growth patterns","therapeutic potential of sitafloxacin","low growth rate","normal cell growth state","based cell death reporter assay","ketoconazole","device-related","library members","daunorubicin","rifapentine","order","high-throughput screening","well-characterized drugs","chronic osteomyelitis","small-molecule libraries","IMPORTANCE Conventional antibiotics","key compounds","traditional method","chemical libraries","antibiotic therapies","SCV\u2019s ability","critical need","screening paradigm","established biofilm","rapid identification of new therapeutic uses","new clinical therapeutics","reduced antibiotic susceptibility","economical route","microorganisms","comparison","biosynthetic pathways","Food","avenue","methicillin-susceptible","endocarditis","little success","time-consuming process","kinase","alternative strategy","recurrence","label utility","Studies","investigation","results","study"],"language":"en"},

Among the different inflammatory products, macrophage-derived foam cells and smooth muscle cells synthesize matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), playing a pivotal role in early plaque formation and enlargement. We found increased levels of MMP-9 and MMP-13 in human endarterectomies with advanced atherosclerosis, together with significant amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM) metalloproteinase inducer EMMPRIN. To test whether the absence of NO may aggravate atherosclerosis through EMMPRIN activation, double NOS3/apoE knockout (KO) mice expressed high levels of EMMPRIN in carotid plaques, suggesting that targeting extracellular matrix degradation may represent a new mechanism by which endothelial NO prevents atherosclerosis. Based on our previous experience, by using gadolinium-enriched paramagnetic fluorescence micellar nanoparticles conjugated with AP9 (NAP9), an EMMPRIN-specific binding peptide, magnetic resonance sequences allowed non-invasive visualization of carotid EMMPRIN in NOS3/apoE over apoE control mice, in which atheroma plaques were significantly reduced. Taken together, these results point to EMMPRIN as a new therapeutic target of NO-mediated protection against atherosclerosis, and NAP9 as a non-invasive molecular tool to target atherosclerosis.","publish_time":"2018-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramirez-Carracedo, Rafael; Tesoro, Laura; Hernandez, Ignacio; Diez-Mata, Javier; Filice, Marco; Toro, Roc\u00EDo; Rodriguez-Pi\u00F1ero, Manuel; Zamorano, Jose Luis; Saura, Marta; Zaragoza, Carlos","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5fb9518f07541bb5ee6f8f9ef9d374416ffeecc7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6214015.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6214015/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EMMPRIN activation","high levels of EMMPRIN","advanced atherosclerosis","non-invasive visualization of carotid EMMPRIN","metalloproteinase inducer EMMPRIN","EMMPRIN-specific binding peptide","apoE knockout","apoE control mice","matrix metalloproteinases","NAP9","extracellular matrix degradation","endothelial dysfunction","carotid plaques","atheroma plaques","significant amounts of extracellular matrix","systemic atheroma plaque formation","early plaque formation","new therapeutic target","increased levels of MMP","double NOS3","Lack of endothelial nitric oxide","new mechanism","smooth muscle cells","non-invasive molecular tool","macrophage-derived foam cells","magnetic resonance sequences","ECM","gadolinium-enriched paramagnetic fluorescence micellar nanoparticles","MMPs","monocyte infiltration","pivotal role","mediated protection","different inflammatory products","arterial territories","enlargement","human endarterectomies","previous experience","results","absence"],"language":"en"},

Initially, an SGT gene, designated as OsSGT1, was isolated from O. saundersiae. OsSGT1-containing cell free extract was then used as the biocatalyst to react with 49 structurally diverse drug-like compounds. The recombinant OsSGT1 was shown to be active against both 3\u03B2- and 17\u03B2-hydroxyl steroids. Unexpectedly, in an effort to identify OsSGT1, we found the bacteria lacA gene in lac operon actually encoded an SGA, specifically catalyzing the acetylations of sugar moieties of steroid 17\u03B2-glucosides. Finally, a novel enzymatic two-step synthesis of two ASGs, acetylated testosterone-17-O-\u03B2-glucosides (AT-17\u03B2-Gs) and acetylated estradiol-17-O-\u03B2-glucosides (AE-17\u03B2-Gs), from the abundantly available free steroids using OsSGT1 and EcSGA1 as the biocatalysts was developed. The two-step process is characterized by EcSGA1-catalyzed regioselective acylations of all hydroxyl groups on the sugar unit of unprotected steroidal glycosides (SGs) in the late stage, thereby significantly streamlining the synthetic route towards ASGs and thus forming four monoacylates. The improved cytotoxic activities of 3\u2032-acetylated testosterone17-O-\u03B2-glucoside towards seven human tumor cell lines were thus observable.","publish_time":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ming; Kong, Jian-Qiang","journal":"Acta Pharm Sin B","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c08aea2dc326afc98c4359cf5f35951d13c09af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6251810.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6251810/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzMyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-\u03B2","\u03B2-glucosides","\u03B2-Gs","\u03B2-hydroxyl steroids","ASGs","recombinant OsSGT1","steroidal glycosyltransferase","acetylated testosterone17-O","steroidal glycoside acyltransferase","sugar unit of unprotected steroidal glycosides","biosynthesis of acylated steroidal glycosides","acetylated estradiol","SGT gene","cell free extract","available free steroids","hydroxyl groups","Ornithogalum saundersiae","two-step process","bacteria lacA gene","EcSGA1-catalyzed regioselective acylations","human tumor cell lines","acetylations of sugar moieties of steroid","novel enzymatic two-step synthesis","Escherichia coli","application","lac operon","functional characterization","late stage","improved cytotoxic activities","discovery","diverse drug","synthetic route","compounds","biocatalysts","monoacylates","effort"],"language":"en"},

In the current study, we examined the effect of the Hsp90 inhibitor pochonin D, in vitro and in vivo, using a murine model of human rhinovirus type 1B (HRV1B) infection.

Harbin is one of the major cities in northeast China, and more than half of any given year in Harbin is occupied by winter. To reveal the viral etiology and seasonality in adult patients from Harbin, a 4-year consecutive survey was conducted in Harbin, China. Methods: From January 2014 to December 2017, specimens were obtained from adult patients admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University with lower respiratory tract infections. Sputum samples were examined by direct immunofluorescence assays to detect seven common respiratory viruses, including influenza virus (type A and B), parainfluenza virus (type 1 to 3), respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Adenovirus positive samples were seeded onto A549 cells to isolate viral strains. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the highly variable region of adenoviral hexon gene. Results: A total of 1,300 hospitalized adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections were enrolled, in which 189 patients (14.5%) were detected as having at least one viral infection. The co-infection rate in this study was 25.9% (49/189). The dominant viral pathogen from 2014 to 2017 was parainfluenza virus, with a detection rate of 7.2%, followed by influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Based on the climate seasons determined by daily average temperature, the highest overall viral detection rate was detected in spring (22.0%, 52/236), followed by winter (13.4%, 109/813), autumn (11.4%, 13/114) and summer (10.9%, 15/137). Adenovirus type 3 strains with slight variations were isolated from positive cases, which were closely related to the GB strain from the United States, as well as the Harbin04B strain isolated locally. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that common respiratory viruses were partially responsible for hospitalized lower respiratory tract infections in adult patients from Harbin, China, with parainfluenza virus as the dominant viral pathogen. Climate seasons could be rational indicators for the seasonality analysis of airborne viral infections. Future surveillance on viral mutations would be necessary to reveal the evolutionary history of respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2018-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yingchen; Dong, Tuo; Qi, Guiyun; Qu, Lixin; Liang, Wei; Qi, Binbin; Zhang, Zhe; Shang, Lei; Gao, Hong; Du, Xiqiao; Lu, Bing; Guo, Yan; Liu, Zhenwei; Yu, Huisong; Cui, Qi; Wang, Xiaocen; Li, Ye; Guo, Weiyuan; Qu, Zhangyi","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb495813627c5daa898a901ef2c076fe8469ea66.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6277751.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6277751/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Harbin","United States"],"keyphrases":["Respiratory infections","respiratory syncytial virus","viral strains","lower respiratory tract infections","parainfluenza virus","viral mutations","viral etiology","common respiratory viruses","hospitalized adult patients","prevalence of viral infection","dominant viral pathogen","seasonality analysis of airborne viral infections","evolutionary history of respiratory viruses","Adenovirus type","highest overall viral detection rate","northeast China","Adenovirus positive samples","co-infection rate","Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University","study","climate seasons","winter","Sputum samples","given year","positive cases","Phylogenetic analysis","GB strain","Harbin04B strain","year consecutive survey","average temperature","slight variations","direct immunofluorescence assays","rational indicators","great challenge","A549 cells","global health","half","variable region of adenoviral hexon gene","major cities","total","United States","Future surveillance","Background","spring","Results","Conclusion","specimens","Methods","autumn","summer"],"language":"en"},

Kupffer cells, the major immune cell population involved in innate immune responses, are considered to be central for FH. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is a pro-coagulant protein that is substantially induced in macrophages upon viral infection, and Fgl2 depletion represses murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) infection. Clara cell 10 kDa (CC10) protein is a secretory protein with anti-inflammatory properties in allergic rhinitis and asthma. However, its mechanisms of action and pathogenic roles in other disease are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CC10 in FH and the regulation of Fgl2 by CC10. Methods: A mouse FH model was established by peritoneal injection of MHV-3. The mice received CC10 protein through tail vein injection before viral infection. Survival rate, liver function, liver histology, fibrin deposition, and necrosis were examined. The regulatory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression was investigated using THP-1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Results: In the mouse FH model induced by MHV-3, the survival rate increased from 0 to 12.5% in the CC10 group compared to that in the saline-only control group. Meanwhile, the levels of ALT and AST in serum were significantly decreased and liver damage was reduced. Furthermore, hepatic Fgl2, TNF-\u03B1, and IL-1\u03B2 expression was obviously downregulated together with fibrin deposition, and hepatocyte apoptosis was reduced after administration of CC10 protein. In vitro, CC10 was found to significantly inhibit the expression of Fgl2 in IFN-\u03B3-treated THP-1 cells and MHV-3-infected mouse peritoneal macrophages by western blot and real-time PCR. However, there was no direct interaction between CC10 and Fgl2 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation. Microarray investigations suggested that HMG-box transcription factor 1 (HBP1) was significantly low in CC10-treated and IFN-\u03B3-primed THP-1 cells. HBP1-siRNA treatment abrogated the inhibitory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells (HUVECs). Conclusion:CC10 protects against MHV-3-induced FH via suppression of Fgl2 expression in macrophages. Such effects may be mediated by the transcription factor HBP1.","publish_time":"2018-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Haijing; Liu, Yang; Wang, Hongwu; Wan, Xiaoyang; Huang, Jiaquan; Yan, Weiming; Xi, Dong; Luo, Xiaoping; Shen, Guanxin; Ning, Qin","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0c2cd2793d71f1ea11a810442a2c06d5013e899.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6300492.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6300492/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzM5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Clara"],"organizations":["AST","Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of Fgl2","CC10 group","role of CC10","administration of CC10 protein","Fgl2 depletion","suppression of Fgl2 expression","regulation of Fgl2","hepatic Fgl2","inhibitory effect of CC10","regulatory effect of CC10","induced FH","mouse FH model","secretory protein","peritoneal injection of MHV","\u03B2 expression","infected mouse peritoneal macrophages","Kupffer cells","pro-coagulant protein","treated THP","viral infection","transcription factor HBP1","Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells","liver histology","liver function","IFN-\u03B3","fibrin deposition","primed THP","liver damage","Survival rate","tail vein injection","HBP1-siRNA treatment","major immune cell population","human life","Clara cell","HMG-box transcription factor","Fulminant hepatitis","control group","innate immune responses","murine hepatitis virus","anti-inflammatory properties","western blot","allergic rhinitis","serum","HUVECs","pathogenic roles","TNF-\u03B1","hepatocyte apoptosis","serious threat","disease","asthma","kDa","mice","mechanisms of action","Microarray investigations","levels of ALT","saline","PCR","necrosis","Background","Methods","Results","direct interaction","rapid necroinflammation","co-immunoprecipitation","Conclusion","Fibrinogen","effects","study"],"language":"en"},

In particular, rapidly recognising whether infected individuals stem from a single outbreak sustained by local transmission, or from repeated introductions, is crucial to adopt effective interventions. In this study, we introduce a new framework for combining several data streams, e.g. temporal, spatial and genetic data, to identify clusters of related cases of an infectious disease. Our method explicitly accounts for underreporting, and allows incorporating preexisting information about the disease, such as its serial interval, spatial kernel, and mutation rate. We define, for each data stream, a graph connecting all cases, with edges weighted by the corresponding pairwise distance between cases. Each graph is then pruned by removing distances greater than a given cutoff, defined based on preexisting information on the disease and assumptions on the reporting rate. The pruned graphs corresponding to different data streams are then merged by intersection to combine all data types; connected components define clusters of cases related for all types of data. Estimates of the reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases infected by an infectious individual in a large population), and the rate of importation of the disease into the population, are also derived. We test our approach on simulated data and illustrate it using data on dog rabies in Central African Republic. We show that the outbreak clusters identified using our method are consistent with structures previously identified by more complex, computationally intensive approaches.","publish_time":"2018-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cori, Anne; Nouvellet, Pierre; Garske, Tini; Bourhy, Herv\u00E9; Nakoun\u00E9, Emmanuel; Jombart, Thibaut","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1b08674379f9805e1ab55ce13c056b716433b8a2.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fc26cafc8843bb3223e9e9af13a91df3b9274ea6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6312344.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6312344/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2OzQxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["data types","types of data","genetic data","simulated data","clusters of cases","different data streams","clusters of related cases","outbreak clusters","average number of secondary cases","Early assessment of infectious disease outbreaks","infectious individual","preexisting information","mutation rate","reporting rate","rate of importation","method","spatial kernel","single outbreak","reproduction number","large population","effective interventions","pruned graphs","effective control measures","infected individuals stem","local transmission","dog rabies","assumptions","connected components","Central African Republic","repeated introductions","given cutoff","serial interval","new framework","edges","intersection","distances greater","structures","underreporting","intensive approaches","study","Estimates"],"language":"en"},

Over two dozen cases of in-flight transmissions have been documented. To understand these risks, a characterization of the airplane cabin microbiome is necessary. Our study team collected 229 environmental samples on ten transcontinental US flights with subsequent 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that bacterial communities were largely derived from human skin and oral commensals, as well as environmental generalist bacteria. We identified clear signatures for air versus touch surface microbiome, but not for individual types of touch surfaces. We also found large flight-to-flight beta diversity variations with no distinguishing signatures of individual flights, rather a high between-flight diversity for all touch surfaces and particularly for air samples. There was no systematic pattern of microbial community change from pre- to post-flight. Our findings are similar to those of other recent studies of the microbiome of built environments. In summary, the airplane cabin microbiome has immense airplane to airplane variability. The vast majority of airplane-associated microbes are human commensals or non-pathogenic, and the results provide a baseline for non-crisis-level airplane microbiome conditions.

The type 1 human immunodeficiency virus is a good paradigm to understand the great diversity of translational control. Indeed, scanning, leaky scanning, internal ribosome entry sites, and adenosine methylation are used by ribosomes to translate spliced and unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs, and some require specific cellular factors, such as the DDX3 helicase, that mediate mRNA export and translation. In addition, some viral and cellular proteins, including the HIV-1 Tat protein, also regulate protein synthesis through targeting the protein kinase PKR, which once activated, is able to phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2\u03B1, which results in the inhibition of cellular mRNAs translation. Finally, the infection alters the integrity of several cellular proteins, including initiation factors, that directly or indirectly regulates translation events.

Despite extensive knowledge of AIV in Asian LAMs, little is known about the prevalence South American LAMs. To fill this gap in knowledge, active surveillance was carried out at the major LAM in Medellin, Colombia between February and September 2015. During this period, overall prevalence in the market was 2.67% and a North American origin H11N2 AIV most similar to a virus isolated from Chilean shorebirds asymptomatically spread through multiple bird species in the market resulting in 17.0% positivity at peak of infection. Phenotypically, the H11 viruses displayed no known molecular markers associated with increased virulence in birds or mammals, had \u03B12,3-sialic acid binding preference, and caused minimal replication in vitro and little morbidity in vivo. However, the Colombian H11N2 virus replicated and transmitted effectively in chickens explaining the spread throughout the market.

The ability to spread in domestic poultry as well as potential for human infection by H11 viruses highlight the need for enhanced AIV surveillance in South America in both avian species and humans.","publish_time":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jim\u00E9nez-Bluhm, Pedro; Karlsson, Erik A; Ciuoderis, Karl A; Cortez, Valerie; Marvin, Shauna A; Hamilton-West, Christopher; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey; Osorio, Jorge E","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90b065409490de2813ab71b65ca8b401ec55b356.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5180366.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2016.121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27924808/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAM"],"locations":["South America","Colombia","North"],"keyphrases":["H11 viruses","South American shorebirds","prevalence South American LAMs","spread","North American origin H11N2 AIV","enhanced AIV surveillance","extensive knowledge of AIV","potential spillover of avian influenza viruses","avian species","Latin American countries","Asian LAMs","domestic poultry spillover event","multiple bird species","Colombian H11N2 virus","wild bird","Chilean shorebirds","active surveillance","human infection","major LAM","LAM occurrence","peak of infection","overall prevalence","little morbidity","known molecular markers","need","increased virulence","trade","minimal replication","essential source of food","\u03B12","sialic acid binding preference","emergence","mammals","Genetic similarity","Live animal markets","Medellin","gap","humans","hotbeds\u0027","positivity","period","chickens","ability"],"language":"en"},

Yet the majority of viral infections with central nervous system involvement resolve with only mild clinical manifestations, if any. This is generally attributed to efficient elimination of the infection from the brain coverings, i.e. the meninges, ependyma and chorioplexus, which are the primary targets of haematogeneous viral spread. How the immune system is able to purge these structures from viral infection with only minimal detrimental effects is still poorly understood. In the present work we studied how an attenuated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can be cleared from the central nervous system in the absence of overt disease. We show that elimination of the virus from brain ependyma, but not from brain parenchyma, could be achieved by a T cell-dependent mechanism operating independently of major histocompatibility class I antigens and perforin. Considering that cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity is a leading cause of viral immunopathology and tissue damage, our findings may explain why the most common viral intruders of the central nervous system rarely represent a serious threat to our health.","publish_time":"2010-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinschewer, Daniel D.; Schedensack, Mariann; Bergthaler, Andreas; Horvath, Edit; Br\u00FCck, Wolfgang; L\u00F6hning, Max; Merkler, Doron","journal":"Brain","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e5b64c822f6ad70e721ffbf9436d9661f92bc2e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110187.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awq028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20354003/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["central nervous system involvement","immune system","common viral intruders","majority of viral infections","brain ependyma","leading cause of viral immunopathology","primary targets of haematogeneous viral spread","brain coverings","brain parenchyma","efficient elimination","T cell-dependent mechanism","attenuated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity","major histocompatibility class","tissue damage","structures","serious threat","minimal detrimental effects","perforin","antigens","findings","chorioplexus","mild clinical manifestations","meninges","absence of overt disease","disability","present work","health","death"],"language":"en"},

Real-time RT-PCR was developed to specifically quantify both AIV and IBV genomes as well as viral gene copy numbers during mixed infections. The amount of IL-1 beta, in supernatants of co-infected cell cultures, was determined using an ELISA assay. Results Quantitative results of AIV and IBV co-infection showed that interferences between the two viruses yielded decreased viral growth. However, in the case of super-infection, the second virus, either AIV or IBV, induced a decrease in the growth of the first inoculated virus.

Cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by DENV-2 New Guinea C strain (including degenerative morphological changes, detachment, membrane degradation and death of host cells), were reflected by drastic decrease in impedance signal response detected as early as ~30 hours post-infection (hpi). In contrast, distinct CPE by conventional microscopy was evident only at ~72hpi at the corresponding multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. A parameter that describes the kinetics of cytopathogenesis, CIT50, which refers to the time taken for 50% reduction in impedance signal response, revealed an inverse linear relationship with virus titer and MOI. CIT50 values were also delayed by 31.5h for each order of magnitude decrease in MOI. Therefore, based on the analysis of CIT50, the virus titer of a given sample can be determined from the measured impedance signal response. Furthermore, consistent impedance results were also obtained with clinical isolates of the four DENV serotypes verified by RT-PCR and cycle sequencing. This impedimetric cell-based biosensor represents a label-free and continuous approach for the dynamic measurement of cellular responses toward DENV infection, and for detecting the presence of infectious viral particles.","publish_time":"2015-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Ming Soon; Lau, Suk Hiang; Chan, Kwai Peng; Toh, Chee-Seng; Chow, Vincent T.","journal":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58eca001fcf7699a968055cf8adbcac6aba11f63.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126431.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25794961/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566315001621; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566315001621; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.03.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs1NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DENV infection","MOI","measured impedance signal response","DENV serotypes","virus titer","infection of surface","impedimetric cell-based biosensor","corresponding multiplicity of infection","hours post-infection","hpi","consistent impedance results","analysis of CIT50","CIT50 values","real-time monitoring of dengue virus","distinct CPE","fibroblast cells","drastic decrease","death of host cells","degenerative morphological changes","membrane degradation","inverse linear relationship","screen-printed carbon electrode","immobilized baby hamster kidney","New Guinea C strain","dynamic measurement of cellular responses","detachment","BHK","label-free","continuous approach","PLL","conventional microscopy","RT-PCR","poly","clinical isolates","contrast","reduction","given sample","presence of infectious viral particles","cycle sequencing","lysine","kinetics of cytopathogenesis","order of magnitude","Cytopathic effects","parameter"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to evaluate rhinitis (allergic and non\u2010allergic) in the first 18 months of life, its link with other atopic manifestations and the role of respiratory viruses. METHODS: Subjects (n = 1237) of the Singapore GUSTO birth cohort were followed up quarterly until 18 months of age with questionnaires to screen for rhinitis symptoms lasting at least 2 wk and with monthly calls to positive subjects to detect prolonged/recurrent rhinitis symptoms (total duration \u22654 wk). Anterior nasal swabbing for molecular\u2010based virus detection was conducted during these visits and near (within a month) rhinitis episodes. Skin prick testing to common environmental and food allergens was conducted at the 18 month visit. RESULTS: Prolonged/recurrent rhinitis was significantly associated with history of parental atopy (mother: aOR = 2.17; father: aOR = 1.82) and atopic comorbidities of eczema (aOR = 2.53) and wheeze (aOR = 4.63) (p \u003C 0.05), though not with allergen sensitization. Although the frequency of nasal respiratory virus detection during scheduled quarterly visits did not differ between prolonged/recurrent rhinitis and matched controls (p \u003E 0.05), virus detection was higher in swabs obtained within a month following rhinitis episodes in prolonged/recurrent rhinitis subjects compared with scheduled visits (adjusted p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the duration of rhinitis symptoms, this study defined a subset of early childhood rhinitis which was associated with atopic predisposition and comorbidities. Persistent respiratory viral shedding may contribute to the symptomatology. Whether this entity is a precursor of subsequent childhood allergic rhinitis will require longer follow\u2010up.","publish_time":"2015-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hardjojo, Antony; Goh, Anne; Shek, Lynette P.C.; Van Bever, Hugo P.

The nsp16 catalytic subunit of the 2\u0027-O-MTase is unusual in its requirement for a stimulatory subunit (nsp10) to catalyze the ribose 2\u0027-O-methylation of the viral RNA cap.

Most chronic inflammatory CNS disorders are infectious. More indirect evidence that MS is caused by a virus is the association of several viruses with demyelinating encephalomyelitis in human beings, and the induction of demyelination in animals infected with viruses in research. Nevertheless, no virus has been isolated from the brains of patients who had MS.

FIP is a highly fatal systemic disease caused by a virulent feline coronavirus infection in cats. Despite the importance of coronavirus infections in these animals, there are no effective commercial vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these infections. We have previously reported the efficacy of a protease inhibitor in cats with FIP, demonstrating that a virally encoded 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a valid target for antiviral drug development for coronavirus infections. In this study, we extended our previous work on coronavirus inhibitors and investigated the structure-activity relationships of a focused library of protease inhibitors for ferret and mink 3CLpro. Using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, we identified potent inhibitors broadly effective against feline, ferret and mink coronavirus 3CLpro. Multiple amino acid sequence analysis and modelling of 3CLpro of ferret and mink coronaviruses were conducted to probe the structural basis for these findings.

We subjected CHIKV-infected Human Embryo Kidney cells (HEK293), a widely used cell-based system for CHIKV infection studies, to a high throughput expression proteomics analysis by Liquid Chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 1047 differentially expressed proteins were identified in infected cells, consistently in three biological replicates. Proteins involved in transcription, translation, apoptosis and stress response were the major ones among the 209 proteins that had significant up-regulation. In the set of 45 down-regulated proteins, those involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism predominated. A STRING network analysis revealed tight interaction of proteins within the apoptosis, stress response and protein synthesis pathways. We short-listed a common set of 30 proteins that can be implicated in cellular pathology of CHIKV infection by comparing our results and results of earlier CHIKV proteomics studies. Modulation of eight proteins selected from this set was re-confirmed at transcript level. One among them, Nucleophosmin, a nuclear chaperone, showed temporal modulation and cytoplasmic aggregation upon CHIKV infection in double immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. The short-listed cellular proteins will be potential candidates for targeted study of the molecular interactions of CHIKV with host cells. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Chikungunya remained as a neglected tropical disease till its re-emergence in 2005 in the La R\u00E9Union islands and subsequently, in India and many parts of South East Asia. These and the epidemics that followed in subsequent years ran an explosive course leading to extreme morbidity and attributed mortality to this originally benign virus infection. Apart from classical symptoms of acute fever and debilitating polyarthralgia lasting for several weeks, a number of complications were documented. These included aphthous-like ulcers and vesiculo-bullous eruptions on the skin, hepatic involvement, central nervous system complications such as encephalopathy and encephalitis, and transplacental transmission. The disease has recently spread to the Americas with its initial documentation in the Caribbean islands. The Asian genotype of this positive-stranded RNA virus of the Alphavirus genus has been attributed in these outbreaks. However, the disease ran a similar course as the one caused by the East, Central and South African (ECSA) genotype in the other parts of the world. Studies have documented a number of mutations in the re-emerging strains of the virus that enhances mosquito adaptability and modulates virus infectivity. This might support the occurrence of fiery outbreaks in the absence of herd immunity in affected population. Several research groups work to understand the pathogenesis of chikungunya and the mechanisms of complications using cellular and animal models. A few proteomics approaches have been employed earlier to understand the protein level changes in the infected cells. Our present study, which couples a high throughput proteomic analysis and a comparative review of these earlier studies, identifies a few critical molecules as hypothetical candidates that might be important in this infection and for future study.","publish_time":"2015-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abraham, Rachy; Mudaliar, Prashant; Jaleel, Abdul; Srikanth, Jandhyam; Sreekumar, Easwaran","journal":"J Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b278bf04e245866207aaf19050ccd962fc3aed7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102674.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1874391915000913; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1874391915000913; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25782748/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2015.03.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV"],"locations":["India","South East Asia","Caribbean"],"keyphrases":["CHIKV infection studies","short-listed cellular proteins","regulated proteins","cellular pathology of CHIKV infection","results of earlier CHIKV proteomics studies","benign virus infection","infected cells","earlier studies","tight interaction of proteins","molecular interactions of CHIKV","virus infectivity","cellular pathogenesis","CHIKV-infected Human Embryo Kidney cells","Global re-emergence of Chikungunya virus","host cells","number of complications","pathogenesis of chikungunya","high throughput expression proteomics analysis","high throughput proteomic analysis","apoptosis","stress response","central nervous system complications","positive-stranded RNA virus","mechanisms of complications","targeted study","future study","proteomics approaches","present study","common set","parts of South East Asia","STRING network analysis","protein level changes","neglected tropical disease","potential candidates","hypothetical candidates","temporal modulation","explosive course","attributed mortality","Asian genotype","similar course","number of mutations","transcript level","Caribbean islands","R\u00E9Union islands","BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE","biological replicates","cell-based system","protein synthesis pathways","occurrence of fiery outbreaks","Liquid Chromatography","hepatic involvement","skin","encephalopathy","double immunofluorescence staining","cytoplasmic aggregation","comparative review","absence of herd immunity","HEK293","debilitating polyarthralgia","vesiculo-bullous eruptions","tandem mass spectrometry","extreme morbidity","encephalitis","India","ECSA","critical molecules","classical symptoms of acute fever","translation","nuclear chaperone","confocal microscopy","Alphavirus genus","re-emerging strains","mosquito adaptability","major ones","ulcers","affected population","initial documentation","subsequent years","carbohydrate","weeks","transcription","animal models","transplacental transmission","Americas","lipid metabolism","epidemics","Nucleophosmin","research groups","regulation","world","total"],"language":"en"},

A recent cryo-EM structure of a native full-length trimer without any stabilizing mutations had the same core structure, but revealed new insights and features. A more comprehensive and higher resolution understanding of the glycan shield has also emerged, enabling a more complete representation of the Env glycoprotein structure. Complexes of Env trimers with broadly neutralizing antibodies have surprisingly illustrated that most of the Env surface can be targeted in natural infection and that the neutralizing epitopes are almost all composed of both peptide and glycan components. These structures have also provided further evidence of the inherent plasticity of Env and how antibodies can exploit this flexibility by perturbing or even stabilizing the trimer to facilitate neutralization.

Adaptations and ecological patterns illustrated by desert parasite communities can serve as exemplars within the extremes regarding the evolution of virulence, breadth of host spectra, and lifecycle strategies. This review provides relevant examples for each of these three topics using parasites from dryland regions in order to encourage future empirical tests of hypotheses regarding parasite ecology and evolution within dryland ecosystems and stimulate wider investigation into the parasitofauna of arid regions in general. As global climate changes and anthropogenic disturbance increases, desertification is a growing problem which has been labeled as a threat to global health. Thus, deserts not only provide useful natural laboratories in which to study parasite transmission but understanding parasite transmission within these habitats becomes increasingly important as larger, likely highly resource insecure, populations are projected to live on the margins of desert regions in the future.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Warburton, Elizabeth M.","journal":"International journal for parasitology.

Likewise, advanced age correlated with more adverse disease outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in humans. We used an aged African green monkey SARS-CoV infection model to better understand age-related mechanisms of increased susceptibility to viral respiratory infections. Nonhuman primates are critical translational models for such research given their similarities to humans in immune-ageing as well as lung structure. RESULTS: Significant age- and infection-dependent differences were observed in both systemic and mucosal immune compartments. Peripheral lymphocytes, specifically CD8 T and B cells were significantly lower in aged monkeys pre- and post- SARS-CoV infection, while neutrophil and monocyte numbers were not impacted by age or infection status. Serum proinflammatory cytokines were similar in both age groups, whereas significantly lower levels of IL-1beta, IL-18, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-15 were detected in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected aged monkeys at either 5 or 10 days post infection. Total lung leukocyte numbers and relative frequency of CD8 T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells were greatly reduced in the aged host during SARS-CoV infection, despite high levels of chemoattractants for many of these cells in the aged lung. Dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages showed age-dependent differences in activation and chemokine receptor profiles, while the CD8 T cell and B cell responses were significantly reduced in the aged host. In examination of viral titers, significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV were detected in the nasal swabs early, at day 1 post infection, in aged as compared to juvenile monkeys, but virus levels were only slightly higher in aged animals by day 3. Although there was a trend of higher titers in respiratory tissues at day 5 post infection, this did not reach statistical significance and virus was cleared from all animals by day 10, regardless of age. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides unique insight into how several parameters of the systemic and mucosal immune response to SARS-CoV infection are significantly modulated by age. These immune differences may contribute to deficient immune function and the observed trend of higher SARS-CoV replication in aged nonhuman primates.","publish_time":"2014-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clay, Candice C; Donart, Nathan; Fomukong, Ndingsa; Knight, Jennifer B; Overheim, Katie; Tipper, Jennifer; Van Westrienen, Jesse; Hahn, Fletcher; Harrod, Kevin S","journal":"Immun Ageing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e608f2a6b99e0e74c16aa9085128690e20b59ea0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3999990.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4933-11-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24642138/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["post- SARS-CoV infection","aged lung","infection status","aged animals","aged host","higher levels of SARS","CoV-infected aged monkeys","infection-dependent differences","aged African green monkey SARS-CoV infection model","days post infection","lungs of SARS","B cells","aged monkeys pre-","aged nonhuman primates","observed trend of higher SARS-CoV replication","dendritic cells","immune differences","age-dependent differences","age groups","Significant age","advanced age","lower levels of IL","virus levels","relative frequency of CD8 T cells","trend of higher titers","mucosal immune response","mucosal immune compartments","respiratory tissues","respiratory viruses","viral respiratory infections","deficient immune function","B cell responses","macrophages","high levels of chemoattractants","juvenile monkeys","humans","lung structure","Total lung leukocyte numbers","examination of viral titers","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","monocyte numbers","adverse disease outcomes","chemokine receptor profiles","age-related mechanisms of increased susceptibility","activation","critical translational models","research","parameters","monocytes","beta","unique insight","Serum proinflammatory cytokines","similarities","Peripheral lymphocytes","nasal swabs","CONCLUSIONS","study","RESULTS","statistical significance","BACKGROUND","elderly"],"language":"en"},

This checklist is currently being applied for the first time on a large and systematic scale to prepare for the cross border importation of the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo hence the need to document the lessons learnt from this experience. This is more pertinent considering the complex humanitarian context and weak health system under which some of the countries such as the Republic of South Sudan are implementing their EVD preparedness interventions. MAIN TEXT: We identified four main lessons from the ongoing EVD preparedness efforts in the Republic South Sudan. First, EVD preparedness is possible in complex humanitarian settings such as the Republic of South Sudan by using a longer-term health system strengthening approach. Second, the Republic of South Sudan is at risk of both domestic and cross border transmission of EVD and several other infectious disease outbreaks hence the need for an integrated and sustainable approach to outbreak preparedness in the country. Third, a phased and well-prioritized approach is required for EVD preparedness in complex humanitarian settings given the costs associated with preparedness and the difficulties in the accurate prediction of outbreaks in such settings. Fourth, EVD preparedness in complex humanitarian settings is a massive undertaking that requires effective and decentralized coordination. CONCLUSION: Despite a very challenging context, the Republic of South Sudan made significant progress in its EVD preparedness drive demonstrating that it is possible to rapidly scale up preparedness efforts in complex humanitarian contexts if appropriate and context-specific approaches are used. Further research, systematic reviews and evaluation of the ongoing preparedness efforts are required to ensure comprehensive documentation and application of the lessons learnt for future EVD outbreak preparedness and response efforts.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olu, Olushayo Oluseun; Lako, Richard; Wamala, Joseph Francis; Ramadan, Patrick Otim; Ryan, Caroline; Udenweze, Ifeanyi; Berta, Kibebu; Guyo, Argata Guracha; Sokemawu, Alex; Tukuru, Michael; Gray, Henry John; Chimbaru, Alex","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2637540fdd7f81514c542034dd7e8724f8c00cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7170723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32312320/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00657-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EVD"],"locations":["West Africa","Republic of South Sudan","Republic South Sudan"],"keyphrases":["EVD preparedness drive","EVD preparedness interventions","ongoing EVD preparedness efforts","preparedness checklist","future EVD outbreak preparedness","ongoing preparedness efforts","ongoing EVD outbreak","Republic of South Sudan","Republic South Sudan","complex humanitarian settings","cross border transmission of EVD","complex humanitarian contexts","Democratic Republic of Congo","response efforts","main lessons","challenging context","need","sustainable approach","systematic scale","cross border importation","longer-term health system","weak health system","context-specific approaches","infectious disease outbreaks","well-prioritized approach","systematic reviews","MAIN TEXT","accurate prediction of outbreaks","West Africa Ebola virus disease","significant progress","massive undertaking","evaluation","risk","difficulties","costs","comprehensive documentation","application","decentralized coordination","BACKGROUND","research","time","member states","countries","country","CONCLUSION","experience"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we compared different types of IFN-\u03B2-inducing and -non-inducing viruses in the context of Sendai virus infection. We found that some types of unusual viral RNA species were produced by infections with IFN-\u03B2-inducing viruses and accumulated into distinct cytoplasmic structures in an RNA-type-dependent manner. One of these structures was similar to the so-called antiviral stress granules (avSGs) formed by an infection with IFN-inducing viruses whose C proteins were knocked-out or mutated. Non-encapsidated, unusual viral RNA harboring the 5\u2032-terminal region of the viral genome as well as RIG-I and typical SG markers accumulated in these granules. Another was a non-SG-like inclusion formed by an infection with the Cantell strain; a copyback-type DI genome, but not an authentic viral genome, specifically accumulated in the inclusion, whereas RIG-I and SG markers did not. The induction of IFN-\u03B2 was closely associated with the production of these unusual RNAs as well as the formation of the cytoplasmic structures.","publish_time":"2015-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yoshida, Asuka; Kawabata, Ryoko; Honda, Tomoyuki; Tomonaga, Keizo; Sakaguchi, Takemasa; Irie, Takashi","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6ea3039fed0942c355cabc8a67f7226cd05fc8c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4523817.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26300870/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs3ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-inducing viruses","PAMPs of RNA viruses","IFN-\u03B2","RNA-type","non-SG","types of unusual viral RNA species","induction of IFN","authentic viral genome","different types of IFN","virus-derived RNA species","Non-self","RIG","unusual RNAs","distinct cytoplasmic structures","typical SG markers","inclusion","copyback-type DI genome","context of Sendai virus infection","so-called antiviral stress granules","avSGs","infections","Cantell strain","molecular patterns","important defensive responses of mammals","pathogen","formation","terminal region","present study","system","production","dependent manner","C proteins","interferon"],"language":"en"},

For radiation oncology departments, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge for disease protection and prevention for both patients and staff, owing to the weakened immune systems of cancer patients and the need to deliver timely and uninterrupted radiotherapy. At the Hubei Cancer Hospital, the only hospital in Wuhan that specializes in oncology, we organized an emergency infection control team to lead special efforts to combat COVID-19 during this challenging time. Under its lead, the following measures were implemented in the radiation oncology department: the radiotherapy clinic was divided into different infection control zones with varying levels of protection; special staff and patient infection control training sessions were conducted and appropriate measures deployed; daily symptom testing criteria were implemented for patients undergoing treatment; special rotating schedules and infection control methods were implemented for various staff members such as medical physicists/dosimetrists and radiation therapists; modified radiotherapy workflow and specialized treatment area cleaning and disinfection policies and procedures were designed and executed; and special medical waste disposal methods were implemented. We began treating patients using this new COVID-19 radiotherapy treatment workflow and infection control measures on January 30, 2020. During more than one and a half months of uninterrupted radiation oncology clinical operation through the worst of the Wuhan outbreak, no known COVID-19 infection occurred at our radiotherapy center to our patients or employees.

This study surveyed the prevalence of HCoV-NL63 and influenza viruses in patients with influenza-like illness in Taiwan during 2010\u20132011. Methods Throat samples from 107 hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 175 outpatients with influenza-like illness were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays with virus-specific primers, and then virus-positive specimens were confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products. Results HCoV-NL63 infection was identified in 8.4% (9/107) of hospitalized patients with pneumonia, but not found in outpatients with influenza-like illness. Age distribution of HCoV-NL63 infection in hospitalized patients with pneumonia indicated that the group aged 16\u201325 years (20%) had the highest positive rate compared with the other groups, and exhibited a similar age-specific pattern to influenza A/H1N1 infection, but not influenza A/H3N2 and B infections in hospitalized patients. Seasonal prevalence of HCoV-NL63 infection was late winter, overlapping the highest peak of the influenza A/H1N1 epidemic during December 2010 to March 2011 in Taiwan. Co-infection of HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1 was detected in three hospitalized patients. Clinical manifestation analysis indicated that the main symptoms for HCoV-NL63 infection included fever (88.9%), cough (77.8%), and pneumonia (100%). Co-infection caused significantly higher rates of breathing difficulties, cough, and sore throat than those of single infection with HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a low level of heterogeneity between Taiwan and global HCoV-NL63 strains.

Microvascular-epithelial exudation of bulk plasma proteins characteristically occurs in asthmatic patients, being especially pronounced in those with severe and exacerbating asthma. Healthy human and guinea pig airways challenged by noninjurious histamine-leukotriene\u2013type autacoids also respond through prompt mucosal exudation of nonsieved plasma macromolecules. Contrary to current beliefs, epithelial permeability in the opposite direction (ie, absorption of inhaled molecules) has not been increased in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis or in acutely exuding healthy airways. A slightly increased subepithelial hydrostatic pressure produces such unidirectional outward perviousness to macromolecules. Lack of increased absorption permeability in asthmatic patients can further be reconciled with occurrence of epithelial shedding, leaving small patches of denuded basement membrane. Counteracting escalating barrier breaks, plasma exudation promptly covers the denuded patches. Here it creates and sustains a biologically active barrier involving a neutrophil-rich, fibrin-fibronectin net. Furthermore, in the plasma-derived milieu, all epithelial cell types bordering the denuded patch dedifferentiate and migrate from all sides to cover the denuded basement membrane. However, this speedy epithelial regeneration can come at a cost. Guinea pig in vivo studies demonstrate that patches of epithelial denudation regeneration are exudation hot spots evoking asthma-like features, including recruitment/activation of granulocytes, proliferation of fibrocytes/smooth muscle cells, and basement membrane thickening. In conclusion, nonsieved plasma macromolecules can operate on the intact airway mucosa as potent components of first-line innate immunity responses. Exuded plasma also takes center stage in epithelial regeneration. When exaggerated, epithelial regeneration can contribute to the inception and development of asthma.","publish_time":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Persson, Carl","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2009d1866ea5035aabd85c0a7977e7ae2f57b57c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112321.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30170125/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674918312053; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674918312053; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2018.07.037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs4MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guinea"],"keyphrases":["epithelial permeability","speedy epithelial regeneration","patches of epithelial denudation regeneration","Microvascular-epithelial exudation of bulk plasma proteins","epithelial cell types","occurrence of epithelial shedding","Exuded plasma","airway aspects of plasma exudation","denuded patches","prompt mucosal exudation of nonsieved plasma macromolecules","plasma-derived milieu","small patches of denuded basement membrane","asthmatic patients","exacerbating asthma","development of asthma","exudation hot spots","basement membrane thickening","Lack of increased absorption permeability","guinea pig airways","healthy airways","current views","current beliefs","increased subepithelial hydrostatic pressure","active barrier","intact airway mucosa","escalating barrier breaks","absorption of inhaled molecules","relation","smooth muscle cells","proliferation of fibrocytes","potent components","type autacoids","noninjurious histamine-leukotriene","unidirectional outward perviousness","neutrophil-rich","activation of granulocytes","recruitment","features","opposite direction","studies","center stage","allergic rhinitis","line innate immunity responses","sides","inception","fibrin-fibronectin net","review","disease","conclusion","cost"],"language":"en"},

Since 2008, all patients undergo a dedicated pulmonary screening consisting of pulmonary function test (PFT), chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) before HCT. We systematically evaluated the yield during the first 5 years of our screening program. We included 142 consecutive children. In 74% of patients, abnormalities were found. In 66% of patients, 1 or more PFT results were \u003C80% of normal.

Calves inoculated with virulent virus produced higher titers of BCV antibodies in the intestines than those inoculated with the attenuated virus. The failure of the calves to respond to the attenuated virus was apparently due to the inability of the virus to replicate to high titers. Spiral colon, ileum, and jejunum were found to be immunologically distinct; the highest anti-BCV antibody responses were detected in spiral colon, the primary site of infection, and involved all four isotypes of bovine immunoglobulins.

HCoV-EMC was found to infect the human respiratory tract (polarized airway epithelium cell line Calu-3, embryonic fibroblast cell line HFL, and lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549), kidney (embryonic kidney cell line HEK), intestinal tract (colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2), liver cells (hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh-7), and histiocytes (malignant histiocytoma cell line His-1), as evident by detection of high or increasing viral load in culture supernatants, detection of viral nucleoprotein expression by immunostaining, and/or detection of cytopathic effects. Although an infected human neuronal cell line (NT2) and infected monocyte and T lymphocyte cell lines (THP-1, U937, and H9) had increased viral loads, their relatively lower viral production corroborated with absent nucleoprotein expression and cytopathic effects. This range of human tissue tropism is broader than that for all other HCoVs, including SARS coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63, which may explain the high mortality associated with this disease. A recent cell line susceptibility study showed that HCoV-EMC can infect primate, porcine, and bat cells and therefore may jump interspecies barriers.

Interactions between N proteins and RNA are thus crucial for the assembly of infectious virus particles.

We obtained a stable fragment of 14.7 kDa spanning its N-terminal residues 29\u2013160 (IBV-N29-160). Like the N-terminal RNA binding domain (SARS-N45-181) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) N protein, the crystal structure of the IBV-N29-160 fragment at 1.85 \u00C5 resolution reveals a protein core composed of a five-stranded antiparallel \u03B2 sheet with a positively charged \u03B2 hairpin extension and a hydrophobic platform that are probably involved in RNA binding.

Abstract Human coronaviruses, with two known serogroups named 229-E and OC-43, are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses. The large RNA is surrounded by a nucleoprotein (protein N). The envelop contains 2 or 3 glycoproteins: spike protein (or protein S), matrix protein (or protein M) and a hemagglutinin (or protein HE). Their pathogen role remains unclear because their isolation is difficult. Reliable and rapid methods as immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction allow new researches on epidemiology. Human coronaviruses can survive for as long as 6 days in suspension and 3 hours after drying on surfaces, suggesting that they could be a source of hospital-acquired infections. Two prospective studies conducted in a neonatal and paediatric intensive care unit demonstrated a significant association of coronavirus-positive naso-pharyngal samples with respiratory illness in hospitalised preterm neonates. Positive samples from staff suggested either a patient-to-staff or a staff-to-patient transmission. No cross-infection were observed from community-acquired respiratory-syncitial virus or influenza-infected children to neonates. Universal precautions with hand washing and surface desinfection could be proposed to prevent coronavirus transmission.","publish_time":"2002-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gagneur, A.; Legrand, M.

Although the sensitivity of different types of upper respiratory tract samples seems to be correlated to the number of sampled cells, this link remains largely unexplored. METHODS: Our study included 800 upper respiratory tract specimens of which 400 negative and 400 positive for viral detection in multiplex PCR. All samples were selected and matched for age in these 2 groups. For the positive group, samples were selected for the detected viral species. RESULTS: Among the factors influencing the cellularity were the type of sample (p \u003C 0.0001); patient age (p \u003C 0.001); viral positive or negative nature of the sample (p = 0.002); and, for the positive samples, the number of viral targets detected (0.004 \u003C p \u003C 0.049) and viral species. CONCLUSION: The cellular load of upper respiratory samples is multifactorial and occurs for many in the sensitivity of molecular detection.

Toutes les \u00E9tapes du parcours oncologique en radiologie interventionnelle (r\u00E9union de concertation pluridisciplinaire, consultation pr\u00E9 et post-th\u00E9rapeutique, imagerie pr\u00E9 et post-th\u00E9rapeutique et intervention de RI) doivent \u00EAtre organis\u00E9es dans le respect des mesures barri\u00E8res (r\u00E8gles d\u2019hygi\u00E8ne et de distanciation sociale) pour assurer la protection des patients et du personnel d\u2019une contamination au SARS-CoV-2. Le d\u00E9pistage des patients COVID-suspects doit \u00EAtre effectu\u00E9 scrupuleusement avant chaque \u00E9tape du parcours de soin. Les t\u00E9l\u00E9consultations doivent \u00EAtre favoris\u00E9es, en dehors des consultations coupl\u00E9es \u00E0 une \u00E9chographie de faisabilit\u00E9. Si un bilan scanographique est n\u00E9cessaire avant une prise en charge, une exploration thoracique peut permettre de d\u00E9couvrir fortuitement des l\u00E9sions suspectes de COVID-19. Les conditions d\u2019anesth\u00E9sie (curarisation) doivent \u00EAtre discut\u00E9es avec l\u2019\u00E9quipe d\u2019anesth\u00E9sie-r\u00E9animation afin d\u2019optimiser l\u2019utilisation des drogues anesth\u00E9siques et diminuer le risque de contagion en salle. Les anesth\u00E9sies loco-r\u00E9gionales doivent \u00EAtre favoris\u00E9es. En cette p\u00E9riode pand\u00E9mique, les techniques mini-invasives de RIO doivent \u00EAtre favoris\u00E9es aux d\u00E9pens des traitements chirurgicaux pour diminuer les ressources anesth\u00E9siques (personnel et m\u00E9dicaments) en rapport avec les recommandations des soci\u00E9t\u00E9s savantes. Un protocole de prise en charge des patients avec un circuit \u00AB COVID-non suspect \u00BB d\u2019une part et un circuit \u00AB COVID-suspect \u00BB et \u00AB COVID-confirm\u00E9 \u00BB doit \u00EAtre mis en place en collaboration avec l\u2019\u00E9quipe d\u2019hygi\u00E8ne et l\u2019\u00E9quipe d\u2019anesth\u00E9sie. Conclusion: Le patient oncologique doit \u00EAtre une priorit\u00E9 pour la RI en p\u00E9riode de pand\u00E9mie au COVID-19. Toutes les mesures doivent \u00EAtre mises en \u0153uvre pour diminuer le risque de transmission aux patients et au personnel. La RI peut permettre d\u2019optimiser les ressources anesth\u00E9siques (m\u00E9decins et m\u00E9dicaments). Abstract Introduction: Interventional oncology should remain a priority among interventional radiology procedures during the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic. It should be adapted to anesthetic resources and hospital beds capacity. Oncology patients not affected by COVID-19 should be treated in a safe environment to reduce the risk of exposure. Take-home points: Diagnostic and interventional radiology in oncology should remain a priority consideration during the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic. Health status, comorbidities and risk of being severely affected by COVID-19 should be taken into consideration for post postponement of elective procedures or patient referral to a hospital not specialized in the fight against COVID-19. The different steps of the oncology clinical pathway including pluridisciplinary tumor board, pre and post-interventional office visits, pre and post-procedural imaging and interventional radiology procedures should be reorganized in order to provide appropriate services (hygiene practices and physical barriers) to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to patients et healthcare personnel. Phone calls to patients planned to be admitted the following days should be organized to ensure these patients do not present any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Telemedicine or phone calls should replace office visits unless an ultrasound examination is scheduled for the pre-intervention evaluation. If CT examination is necessary for the oncological evaluation, pulmonary lesions compatible with COVID-19 may be accidentally diagnosed. Careful attention should be paid to the indications and types of drugs used for general anesthesia in patients with COVID-19 because of medication shortage and to prevent cross-contamination of patients and medical staff. Locoregional anesthesia should be favored. Minimally-invasive interventional oncology procedures should be favored as an alternative to surgery to spare medical resources and medications in accordance with the recommendations of national oncological societies. Institutional healthcare policies and protocols must be organized with identification of dedicated COVID-19 transportation and care sections. Conclusion: Oncological procedures should be prioritized during the COVID-19 pandemic. Protective measures must be in place throughout the hospital and the radiology department to reduce the risks of exposure of the patients and the staff. Interventional radiology procedures offered as alternative treatments to surgery may optimize medical resources, anesthetic drugs and critical care unit beds.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fohlen, A;

Twenty 9-day-old piglets [PEDV-infected (n =9) and Mock (n =11)] from PEDV seronegative sows, were orally inoculated [8.9log10 genomic equivalents/pig] with PEDV PC21A strain or mock. At post-inoculation days (PIDs) 1\u20135, infected pigs showed severe watery diarrhea and/or vomiting and severe atrophic enteritis. By immunohistochemistry, PEDV antigens were evident in enterocytes lining the villous epithelium. At PIDs 1\u20135, PEDV-infected pigs exhibited mildly to extensively disorganized, irregular distribution and reduced expression of ZO-1 or E-Cadherin in villous, but not crypt epithelial cells of the jejunum and ileum, but not in the large intestine, when compared to the negative controls. The structural destruction and disorganization of TJ and AJ were extensive in PEDV-infected pigs at PIDs 1\u20133, but then appeared to reversibly recover at PID 5, as evident by increased numbers of ZO-1-positive epithelial cells and markedly improved appearance of E-Cadherin-positive villous epithelium. Our results suggest a possible involvement of structurally impaired TJ and AJ in the pathogenesis of PEDV, potentially leading to secondary bacterial infections.","publish_time":"2015-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Kwonil; Eyerly, Bryan; Annamalai, Thavamathi; Lu, Zhongyan; Saif, Linda J.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5eafac56a54ae00c02fd71344e6f5642d41ee3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117115.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515001261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843943/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515001261; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.03.022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["TJ"],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEDV-infected pigs","PEDV antigens","pathogenesis of PEDV","PEDV PC21A strain","PEDV seronegative sows","Cadherin-positive villous epithelium","intestinal epithelium","PIDs","crypt epithelium of nursing pigs","E-Cadherin proteins","crypt epithelial cells","positive epithelial cells","impaired TJ","disorganization of TJ","Mock","reduced expression of ZO","improved appearance of E","increased numbers of ZO","severe watery diarrhea","adherens junctions","tight junctions","large intestine","severe atrophic enteritis","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","proper functioning","barrier","irregular distribution","situ identification of zonula occludin","TJs","enterocytes","absorption of water","possible involvement","staining","9log10 genomic equivalents","ileum","jejunum","structural destruction","Abstract Integrity","uptake of luminal bacteria","day-old piglets","AJs","post-inoculation days","immunohistochemistry","secondary bacterial infections","results","negative controls","immunofluorescence"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to assess the association between Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and to compare the predictive ability of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Confusion, Urea, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age 65 (CURB65) score. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. SUBJECTS: Confirmed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized in the ICU of Tongji hospital from January 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 178 potentially eligible patients with symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, 23 patients (12.92%) were diagnosed as suspected cases, and one patient (0.56%) suffered from cardiac arrest immediately after admission. Ultimately, 154 patients were enrolled in the analysis and 52 patients (33.77%) died. Mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (23.23 \u00B1 6.05) was much higher in deaths compared with the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 10.87 \u00B1 4.40 in survivors (p \u003C 0.001). Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01\u20131.13). In predicting hospital mortality, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score demonstrated better discriminative ability (area under the curve, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.942\u20130.990) than Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (area under the curve, 0.867; 95% CI, 0.808\u20130.926) and CURB65 score (area under the curve, 0.844; 95% CI, 0.784\u20130.905). Based on the cut-off value of 17, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score could predict the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 86.27%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the survivor probability of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score less than 17 was notably higher than that of patients with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 (p \u003C 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score was an effective clinical tool to predict hospital mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and CURB65 score. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score greater than or equal to 17 serves as an early warning indicator of death and may provide guidance to make further clinical decisions.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zou, Xiaojing; Li, Shusheng; Fang, Minghao; Hu, Ming; Bian, Yi; Ling, Jianmin; Yu, Shanshan; Jing, Liang; Li, Donghui; Huang, Jiao","journal":"Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/84aec644fc7b86000728954cc9cf99ebcebd0a08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217128.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371611/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Acute Physiology","Chronic Health Evaluation II","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Chronic Health Evaluation","CURB65 score","score greater","mean Acute Physiology","predictive ability of Acute Physiology","death of patients","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score","eligible patients","Confirmed patients","symptoms of coronavirus disease","survivor probability of patients","major global health threat","predicting hospital mortality","ICU of Tongji hospital","area","curve","China","discriminative ability","clinical decisions","great number of deaths","effective clinical tool","Kaplan-Meier analysis","early warning indicator of death","Urea","Confusion","Respiratory rate","Blood pressure","Age","adjusted hazard ratio","guidance","Wuhan","SUBJECTS","CONCLUSIONS","association","MAIN RESULTS","DESIGN","Retrospective observational cohort","SETTING","sensitivity","cut-off value","suspected cases","cardiac arrest","admission","MEASUREMENTS","survivors","OBJECTIVES","specificity","INTERVENTIONS"],"language":"en"},

Methods Data on annual patient-days and annual consumption (defined daily dose/1000 patient-days) of glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), linezolid, fusidic acid, tigecycline, and daptomycin were analyzed. Yearly aggregated data on the number of nonduplicate clinical MRSA and VRE isolates causing HCAI were collected. Results Overall, the consumption of teicoplanin and linezolid significantly increased during the study period. A significant decrease in the incidence of HCAI-MRSA and a significant increase in the incidence of HCAI-VRE were found during the study period. A significant correlation was found between the increased use of teicoplanin and linezolid and the decreased incidence of HCAI-MRSA. By contrast, positive correlations were found between the consumption of teicoplanin and tigecycline and the incidence of HCAI-VRE. Conclusion This study identified various correlations between the consumption of antibiotics and the incidence of HCAI-MRSA and HCAI-VRE.

Areas covered: Here, the epidemiological dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that stand in close relation to distinct immunogenetic characters of the pathogen are discussed, to understand the ability and inability of the immune system in combatting COVID-19. Expert opinion: The elderly population is at increased risk of developing and dying from COVID-19. Comorbidity is present in more than 30% of cases with COVID-19. Except for less than 1% of the total, a chronic condition has been found in all cases that died from COVID-19. Men are more than 1.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19. Evidence links aging to cytokine dysregulation and T-cell repertoire reduction, male population to relatively reduced anti-viral immunity, and COVID-19-related comorbidities to hyper inflammation. The transmission of COVID-19 is influenced by the host-related factors that are known to be associated with immune dysregulation.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima","journal":"Expert Rev Clin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/274c5e6ebc31852006d0f21d82f25c71fdf7d462.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7157951.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32237901/; https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666x.2020.1750954","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["combatting COVID","transmission of COVID","male population","elderly population","immune dysregulation","coronavirus disease","cases","cytokine dysregulation","immune system","related comorbidities","novel coronavirus","host-related factors","T-cell repertoire reduction","distinct immunogenetic characters","Evidence links aging","anti-viral immunity","close relation","inability","epidemiological dynamics","increased risk","probable causative agent","Wuhan","illness","pathogen","nCoV","hyper inflammation","city","China","Expert opinion","times","chronic condition","outbreak of unusual pneumonia","end","total","countries","Comorbidity","Introduction","territories","Men","Areas"],"language":"en"},

The wind tunnel test data is used to correlate the FAD understanding of the three zones. The grid sensitivity test indicates that 200m\u00D7200m is the reasonable resolution for the FAD map; the test also establishes that the lower urban podium zone yields the best correlation with the experimental data. The study further establishes that the simpler two-dimensional ground coverage ratio (GCR), which is readily available in the planning circle, can be used to predict the area\u0027s average pedestrian level urban ventilation performance of the city.

PHF, DP and GA could significantly suppress the expression of allergic inflammatory cytokine IL-33-upregulated intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and the release of chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8 and inflammatory cytokine IL-6 from KU812 cells (all p \u003C 0.05).

The suppression of the IL-33-induced activation of intracellular signalling molecules p38 mitogen activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-\u03BAB and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase in GA-treated KU812 cells could be the underlying mechanism for the suppression on ICAM-1, chemokines and cytokines.

Traditionally, ADMs have been developed to describe the atmospheric transport of chemical pollutants, radioactive matter, dust, and particulate matter. However, they have also enabled researchers to simulate bioaerosol dispersion. To inform risk assessment, the aims of this review were fourfold, namely (1) to describe the most important physical processes related to ADMs and pathogen transport, (2) to discuss studies that focused on the application of ADMs to pathogenic bioaerosols, (3) to discuss emission and inactivation rate parameterisations, and (4) to discuss methods for conversion of concentrations to infection probabilities (concerning quantitative microbial risk assessment). The studies included human, livestock, and industrial sources. Important factors for dispersion included wind speed, atmospheric stability, topographic effects, and deposition. Inactivation was mainly governed by humidity, temperature, and ultraviolet radiation. A majority of the reviewed studies, however, lacked quantitative analyses and application of full quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA). Qualitative conclusions based on geographical dispersion maps and threshold doses were encountered frequently. Thus, to improve risk assessment for future outbreaks and releases, we recommended determining well-quantified emission and inactivation rates and applying dosimetry and dose\u2013response models to estimate infection probabilities in the population at risk.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Leuken, J.P.G.; Swart, A.

In consequence, natural or artificial sequence changes in viral RNAs may have various effects not only on protein stability, function and structure but also on viral replication. In recent decades, several tools have been developed to predict the effect of mutations in structured RNAs such as viral genomes or non-coding RNAs. Some tools use multiple point mutations and also take coding regions into account. However, none of these tools was designed to specifically simulate the effect of mutations on viral long-range interactions. Here, we developed SilentMutations (SIM), an easy-to-use tool to analyze the effect of multiple point mutations on the secondary structures of two interacting viral RNAs. The tool can simulate disruptive and compensatory mutants of two interacting single-stranded RNAs. This allows a fast and accurate assessment of key regions potentially involved in functional long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions and will eventually help virologists and RNA-experts to design appropriate experiments. SIM only requires two interacting single-stranded RNA regions as input. The output is a plain text file containing the most promising mutants and a graphical representation of all interactions. We applied our tool on two experimentally validated influenza A virus and hepatitis C virus interactions and we were able to predict potential double mutants for in vitro validation experiments.

Agreement among these methods has not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate agreement among TTW and NS, NPS, or BAL for identification of viral and bacterial pathogens in dairy calves with BRD. ANIMALS: One hundred dairy calves with naturally acquired BRD. METHODS: Calves were sampled by all 4 methods. Viral agents were identified by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR, bacteria were identified by aerobic culture, and Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) isolates were speciated by PCR. Agreement among TTW and NS, NPS, or BAL was evaluated by calculating the kappa statistic and percent positive agreement. McNemar\u0027s exact test was used to compare the proportions of positive results. RESULTS: Agreement among TTW and NS, TTW and NPS, and TTW and BAL, was very good for identification of P. multocida, M. haemolytica, and M. bovis. For bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), agreement with TTW was moderate for NS, good for NPS, and very good for BAL. For bovine coronavirus (BCV), agreement with TTW was moderate for NS and NPS, and good for BAL. McNemar\u0027s test was significant only for BCV, indicating that for this pathogen the proportion of positive results from NS and NPS could not be considered comparable to TTW.

Objective To investigate the role of viral infections, allergen sensitization, and exposure to indoor allergens as risk factors for acute wheezing in children 0 to 12 years old. Methods One hundred thirty-two children 0 to 12 years of age who sought emergency department care for wheezing and 65 children with no history of wheezing were enrolled in this case-control study. Detection of respiratory syncytial virus antigen, rhinovirus and coronavirus RNA, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza antigens was performed in nasal washes. Total IgE and specific IgE to mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were measured with the CAP system. Major allergens from mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were quantified in dust samples by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by logistic regression. Results In children under 2 years of age, infection with respiratory viruses and family history of allergy were independently associated with wheezing (odds ratio, 15.5 and 4.2; P = .0001 and P = .008, respectively). Among children 2 to 12 years old, sensitization to inhalant allergens was the major risk factor for wheezing (odds ratio, 2.7; P = .03). High-level allergen exposure, exposure to tobacco smoke, and lack of breast-feeding showed no association with wheezing. Conclusions Some risk factors for wheezing previously identified in temperate climates were present in a subtropical area, including respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants and allergy in children older than 2 years. Rhinovirus was not associated with wheezing and did not appear to be a trigger for asthma exacerbations.","publish_time":"2004-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Camara, Ataide A; Silva, Jorgete M; Ferriani, Virginia P.L; Tobias, K\u00E1tia R.C; Macedo, Izolete S; Padovani, M\u00E1rcio A; Harsi, Charlotte M; Cardoso, M.Regina A; Chapman, Martin D; Arruda, Eurico; Platts-Mills, Thomas A.E; Arruda, L.Karla","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03a2f9a8c86cde90a603a64a608290d98fed9aa0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127801.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674903026897; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674903026897","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["IgE"],"organizations":["CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute wheezing","history of wheezing","children older","years of age","years old","Major allergens","major risk factor","respiratory syncytial virus infection","Abstract Background Risk factors","inhalant allergens","indoor allergens","respiratory viruses","allergen sensitization","High-level allergen exposure","mites","cockroach","dog","rhinovirus","cat","odds ratio","Detection of respiratory syncytial virus antigen","family history of allergy","subtropical areas","specific IgE","Total IgE","infants","coronavirus RNA","tobacco smoke","adenovirus","parainfluenza antigens","lack of breast-feeding","role of viral infections","emergency department care","multivariate analyses","temperate climates","logistic regression","nasal washes","dust samples","association","case-control study","trigger","asthma exacerbations","ELISA","Objective","CAP system","Conclusions","Results","Methods"],"language":"en"},

The most effective method for purifying TCoV and removing extraneous materials was size-exclusion chromatography as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. More spike-rich particles were observed in the sample purified by chromatography than those purified by sucrose gradient as examined by electron microscopy. Differentiation of turkey anti-TCoV antiserum from normal turkey serum was better achieved by ELISA plates coated with TCoV preparation purified by size-exclusion chromatography than that purified by sucrose density gradient. The results indicated that Sephacryl S-1000 chromatography was useful for purification of TCoV.","publish_time":"2002-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loa, C. C; Lin, T. L; Wu, C. C; Bryan, T.

The present study evaluated parameters of importance for spray drying of siRNA-loaded poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) into nanocomposite microparticles intended for inhalation. The spray drying process was optimised using a statistical design of experiment and by evaluating powder characteristics upon systematic variation of the formulation parameters. Concentration, carbohydrate excipient (trehalose, lactose and mannitol) and the ratio of NP to excipient were varied to monitor the effects on moisture content, particle morphology, particle size and powder yield. The identified optimum conditions were applied for spray drying of siRNA-loaded nanocomposite microparticles, resulting in a product with a low water content (0.78% w/w) and an aerodynamic particle diameter considered suitable for inhalation. The use of mannitol in the formulation allowed a significantly lower moisture content than trehalose and lactose. The inclusion of 50% (w/w) or higher amounts of NPs resulted in a marked change in the surface morphology of the spray-dried particles. Importantly, the integrity and biological activity of the siRNA were preserved during the spray drying process. In conclusion, the present results show that spray drying is a suitable technique for producing nanocomposite microparticles comprising siRNA-containing PLGA NPs for potential use in inhalation therapy.","publish_time":"2010-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jensen, Ditte Marie Krohn; Cun, Dongmei; Maltesen, Morten Jonas; Frokjaer, Sven; Nielsen, Hanne M\u00F8rck; Foged, Camilla","journal":"Journal of Controlled Release","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d24d0f5dd74c28edf4f86ca43674ea9648b0b91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126878.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365909007056; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.10.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365909007056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19840823/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjszODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spray drying","siRNA-loaded nanocomposite microparticles","siRNA-loaded poly","spray-dried particles","particle morphology","PLGA NPs","particle size","lower moisture content","trehalose","lactose","formulation parameters","inhalation therapy","use of mannitol","process","aerodynamic particle diameter","higher amounts of NPs","low water content","surface morphology","powder characteristics","suitable technique","drug delivery","powder yield","potential use","carbohydrate excipient","parameters of importance","present study","present results","Abstract Local delivery of small interfering RNA","nanoparticles","promising new area","lungs","systematic variation","product","effects","lactide-co-glycolide","marked change","statistical design of experiment","ratio of NP","Concentration","integrity","biological activity","identified optimum conditions","conclusion","inclusion"],"language":"en"},

In particular, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of the neck-region of DC-SIGNR is highly polymorphic and the polymorphism has been investigated for genetic predisposition to various infectious diseases, though conflicting results had been reported. As infection is a major cause of human death and a mechanism of natural selection, we hypothesized that VNTR polymorphism of DC-SIGNR might have an effect on human life span. METHODS: Here we collected 361 peri-centenarian individuals (age \u226594 for female and age \u226590 for male) and 342 geographically matched controls (age 22-53, mean 35.0 \u00B1 12.0) from Han Chinese. The VNTR polymorphism of the neck region was determined by PCR and genotype was called by separating the PCR products in agarose gel. RESULTS: A total of 11 genotypes and 5 alleles were found in our population. The genotype distribution, allele frequencies and homozygote proportion did not show a significant difference between peri-centenarian and control group. As gender differences in lifespan are ubiquitously observed throughout the animal kingdom, we then stratified the samples by gender. There was more 6/7 genotypes in female peri-centenarian group than that in female control group, at a marginal level of significance (5.56 vs. 1.28%, p = 0.041). The difference was not significant after correction by Bonferroni method. It suggests a possible differential effect of DC-SIGNR VNTR genotypes between sexes. Further studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary findings and investigate the mechanisms of the underlying functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that there was absence of association between the neck region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR and longevity in Han Chinese population. But the question of whether the DC-SIGNR could affect longevity in a gender-specific pattern remains open.","publish_time":"2009-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hui; Wang, Cheng-Ye; Wang, Jia-Xin; Tang, Nelson Leung-Sang; Xie, Liang; Gong, Yuan-Ying; Yang, Zhao; Xu, Liang-You; Kong, Qing-Peng; Zhang, Ya-Ping","journal":"BMC Med Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d55f09671ad483ed5c25dbff97c970e08c6be947.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2797785.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2350-10-134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20003397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bonferroni"],"organizations":["VNTR","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DC-SIGNR","VNTR polymorphism of DC","SIGNR VNTR genotypes","neck region polymorphism of DC","neck-region","female peri-centenarian group","age","female control group","possible differential effect of DC","peri-centenarian individuals","longevity","significant difference","Han Chinese population","gender differences","host genetic predisposition","gender-specific pattern","genotype distribution","viral infection","conflicting results","PCR products","human life span","major cause of human death","homozygote proportion","various infectious diseases","variable number tandem repeat","allele frequencies","mechanisms","correction","role","absence of association","sexes","marginal level of significance","agarose gel","Bonferroni method","mechanism of","lifespan","matched controls","total","alleles","preliminary findings","animal kingdom","study","underlying functions","samples","BACKGROUND","CD209L","question","CONCLUSIONS","studies","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that m336, an exceptionally potent human anti-MERS-CoV antibody, is almost germline with only one somatic mutation in the heavy chain. The structure of Fab m336 in complex with the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain reveals that its IGHV1-69-derived heavy chain provides more than 85% binding surface and that its epitope almost completely overlaps with the receptor-binding site. Analysis of antibodies from 69 healthy humans suggests an important role of the V(D)J recombination-generated junctional and allele-specific residues for achieving high affinity of binding at such low levels of somatic hypermutation. Our results also have important implications for development of vaccine immunogens based on the newly identified m336 epitope as well as for elucidation of mechanisms of neutralization by m336-like antibodies and their elicitation in vivo.","publish_time":"2015-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ying, Tianlei; Prabakaran, Ponraj; Du, Lanying; Shi, Wei; Feng, Yang; Wang, Yanping; Wang, Lingshu; Li, Wei; Jiang, Shibo; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Zhou, Tongqing","journal":"Nat Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf0a836e3d8d863356950aa4a760e449e5129792.json; document_parses/pdf_json/75622daf6a8bde4809687a432c5bd991d8a849ea.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ecd4b70b244e71dbfe8a014d5986f9eac6fc13b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4571279.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370782/; https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9223","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzM5LmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1720266,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"nej9SKqFSbDcedcFuVfQ7Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_39.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain","binding surface","high affinity of binding","identified m336 epitope","receptor-binding site","structure of Fab m336","potent human anti-MERS-CoV antibody","derived heavy chain","important implications","important role","somatic mutation","healthy humans","Analysis of antibodies","low levels of somatic hypermutation","complex","allele-specific residues","development of vaccine immunogens","J recombination","IGHV1","germline","neutralization","elucidation of mechanisms","results","emerging virus","elicitation","mortality"],"language":"en"},

The therapeutic effectiveness of nucleoside analogues can be dramatically improved by phosphorylation. The ProTide approach was developed using a phosphorylated nucleoside that is masked by esterification with an amino acid and phenol forming a chiral phosphorus center. The biological activity of the ProTides depends, in part, on the stereochemistry at phosphorus, and thus, it is imperative that efficient methods be developed for the chemical synthesis and isolation of diastereomerically pure ProTides. Chiral ProTides are often synthesized by direct displacement of a labile phenol (p-nitrophenol or pentafluorophenol) from a chiral phosphoramidate precursor with the appropriate nucleoside analogue. The ability to produce these chiral products is dictated by the synthesis of the chiral phosphoramidate precursors. The enzyme phosphotriesterase (PTE) from Pseudomonas diminuta is well-known for its high stereoselectivity and broad substrate profile. Screening PTE variants from enzyme evolution libraries enabled the identification of variants of PTE that can stereoselectively hydrolyze the chiral phosphoramidate precursors. The variant G60A-PTE exhibits a 165-fold preference for hydrolysis of the R(P) isomer, while the variant In1W-PTE has a 1400-fold preference for hydrolysis of the S(P) isomer. Using these mutants of PTE, the S(P) and R(P) isomers were isolated on a preparative scale with no detectable contamination of the opposite isomer. Combining the simplicity of the enzymatic resolution of the precursor with the latest synthetic strategy will facilitate the production of diastereometrically pure nucleotide phosphoramidate prodrugs.","publish_time":"2019-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiang, Dao Feng; Bigley, Andrew N.; Desormeaux, Emily; Narindoshvili, Tamari; Raushel, Frank M.","journal":"Biochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4c5e98028a20c04a5cf0de9fcb3d7e61b243842.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6822272.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822272/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Chiral ProTides","chiral phosphoramidate precursors","mutants of PTE","chiral products","Screening PTE variants","p-nitrophenol","variant In1W-PTE","variant G60A-PTE","chiral phosphorus center","phosphorylated nucleoside","appropriate nucleoside analogue","hydrolysis","fold preference","therapeutic effectiveness of nucleoside analogues","opposite isomer","isolation of diastereomerically pure ProTides","production of diastereometrically pure nucleotide phosphoramidate prodrugs","labile phenol","chemical synthesis","identification of variants","enzyme phosphotriesterase","enzyme evolution libraries","high stereoselectivity","Pseudomonas diminuta","pentafluorophenol","detectable contamination","esterification","direct displacement","latest synthetic strategy","broad substrate profile","amino acid","treatment of viral infections","preparative scale","common medications","isomers","efficient methods","enzymatic resolution","cancers","Image","text","ProTide approach","simplicity","biological activity","ability","stereochemistry","phosphorylation"],"language":"en"},

In ICH patients, hematoma enlargement is the most critical risk factor for poor outcomes. Tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been used to reduce hematoma expansion. We analyzed the risk factors for hematoma expansion in ICH patients and compared the predictability of hematoma expansion in ICH patients with the use of tranexamic acid. METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of ICH patients who underwent follow-up computed tomography scans from October 2008 to October 2018. Of the 329 included patients, 67 who received tranexamic acid and 262 who did not receive tranexamic acid were compared. We also analyzed the risk factors of 45 and 284 patients who did and did not experience hematoma expansion, respectively. RESULTS: Hematoma expansion was observed in 7 (10.4%) of 67 patients in the tranexamic acid group and 38 (14.5%) of the 262 patients who did not receive tranexamic acid. There was no statistically significant difference between patients who did and did not received tranexamic acid (p=0.389). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors for hematoma expansion, spot sign and a maximal diameter of 40 mm were identified as risk factors. CONCLUSION: We could not confirm the effect of tranexamic acid on hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Spot sign and the maximal diameter of hematomas were confirmed as risk factors of hematoma expansion. If the maximal diameter is greater than 40 mm, the hematoma should be closely monitored.","publish_time":"2019-09-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Chang Hyeun; Lee, Sang Weon; Kim, Young Ha; Sung, Soon Ki; Son, Dong Wuk; Song, Geun Sung","journal":"Korean J Neurotrauma","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b965ccb656960174a81c75effed2a6f2315f0e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6826086.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6826086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQuY3N2Ozk4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2001435,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:54Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"u9SGaiOBeLgVZaEBr\u002BVxfg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_4.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["risk factors of hematoma expansion","predictability of hematoma expansion","use of tranexamic acid","effect of tranexamic acid","tranexamic acid group","hematoma enlargement","included patients","retrospective analysis of ICH patients","critical risk factor","multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors","maximal diameter of hematomas","spot sign","follow-up computed tomography scans","rupture of small blood vessels","health problems","OBJECTIVE","Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage","poor outcomes","anti-fibrinolytic agent","METHODS","significant difference","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

We investigated possible transmission links between these two seemingly unrelated outbreaks by integration of epidemiological and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. WGS analyses showed that the HAdV-7 isolates from the two outbreaks were genetically indistinguishable; however, a 12 bp deletion in the virus-associated RNA gene distinguished the outbreak isolates from other HAdV-7 isolates. Outbreak HAdV-7 isolates demonstrated increased viral replication compared to non-outbreak associated HAdV-7 isolate. Epidemiological data supported that the first outbreak was caused by introduction of the novel HAdV-7 virus by an infected recruit upon arrival at the training base. Nosocomial transmission by close contacts was the most likely source leading to onset of the second HAdV-7 outbreak, establishing the apparent transmission link between the outbreaks. Our findings imply that in-hospital contact investigations should be encouraged to reduce or interrupt further spread of infectious agents when treating outbreak cases, and WGS can provide useful information guiding infection-control interventions.","publish_time":"2015-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Shaofu; Li, Peng; Liu, Hongbo; Wang, Yong; Liu, Nan; Li, Chengyi; Li, Shenlong; Li, Ming; Jiang, Zhengjie; Sun, Huandong; Li, Ying; Xie, Jing; Yang, Chaojie; Wang, Jian; Li, Hao; Yi, Shengjie; Wu, Zhihao; Jia, Leili; Wang, Ligui; Hao, Rongzhang; Sun, Yansong; Huang, Liuyu; Ma, Hui; Yuan, Zhengquan; Song, Hongbin","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/880359b9dd6158ec31280e45a077f9d59b68e22f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4559894.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26338697/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep13617","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WGS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Outbreak HAdV","outbreak isolates","novel HAdV","non-outbreak","outbreak cases","unrelated outbreaks","Nosocomial transmission","WGS analyses","Epidemiological data","outbreaks of acute respiratory disease","apparent transmission link","possible transmission links","virus-associated RNA gene","integration of epidemiological","increased viral replication","close contacts","useful information","likely source leading","arrival","infected recruit","genome sequencing","infection-control interventions","bp deletion","onset","training base","infectious agents","introduction","hospital contact investigations","findings","China"],"language":"en"},

Replication in vitro was unaffected by the ADRP modifications and the in vivo phenotype of the rIBVs was found to be apathogenic, indicating that restoration of the triple-glycine motif is not sufficient to restore virulence to the apathogenic Beaudette strain.","publish_time":"2018-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keep, Sarah; Bickerton, Erica; Armesto, Maria; Britton, Paul","journal":"J Gen Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/863ffba681e73f1174a2949a281340f82ed241e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6171709.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29893665/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Beaudette","ADRP","IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ADRP activity","ADRP modifications","role of ADRP","complete M41 ADRP domain","conserved triple-glycine motif","restored triple-glycine motif","apathogenic Beaudette strain","IBV nsp","strains of IBV","conserved ADP-ribose","virulence","rIBVs","coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus","multi-functional protein","replicase gene","key difference","avirulent","restoration","non-structural proteins","phenotype","phosphatase","crystal structures","serine mutation","nsps","Replication"],"language":"en"},

The United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), under the auspices of its WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza, is one of the major public health agencies which provides support globally to build national capacity for influenza surveillance. Our main objective was to determine if laboratory assessments supported capacity building efforts for improved global influenza surveillance. METHODS: In 2010, 35 national influenza laboratories were assessed in 34 countries, using a standardized tool. Post-assessment, each laboratory received a report with a list of recommendations for improvement. Uptake of recommendations were reviewed 3.2 mean years after the initial assessments and categorized as complete, in-progress, no action or no update. This was a retrospective study; follow-up took place through routine project management rather than at a set time-point post-assessment. WHO data on National Influenza Centre (NIC) designation, External Quality Assessment Project (EQAP) participation and FluNet reporting was used to measure laboratory capacity longitudinally and independently of the assessments. All data was further stratified by World Bank country income category. RESULTS: At follow-up, 81 % of 614 recommendations were either complete (350) or in-progress (145) for 32 laboratories (91 % response rate). The number of countries reporting to FluNet and the number of specimens they reported annually increased between 2005, when they were first funded by CDC, and 2010, the assessment year (p \u003C 0.01). Improvements were also seen in EQAP participation and NIC designation over time and more so for low and lower-middle income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Assessments using a standardized tool have been beneficial to improving laboratory-based influenza surveillance. Specific recommendations helped countries identify and prioritize areas for improvement. Data from assessments helped CDC focus its technical assistance by country and region. Low and lower-middle income countries made greater improvements in their laboratories compared with upper-middle income countries. Future research could include an analysis of annual funding and technical assistance by country. Our approach serves as an example for capacity building for other diseases.","publish_time":"2015-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Lucinda E.

A cohort study including 2378 women and 2309 men aged 18\u201355 years old enrolled from Liuzhou, China, was conducted with three scheduled visits at 6-month intervals from May 2014 to March 2016. And, a questionnaire survey was performed to collect the diagnosis history of AGWs at the enrollment visit. The data on reported AGW cases of Liuzhou in the NNDRS from 2006 to 2015 were also analyzed. Overall, the incidence rates of AGWs in the prospective study, in the self-reported diagnosis during past 12 months and in the NNDRS were 1.26 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16\u20132.37), 2.35 (95% CI: 1.17\u20134.20) and 0.183 (95% CI: 0.178\u20130.187), respectively. Human papillomavirus 6 or 11 were found in all the AGW biopsy samples (10/10). The onset time of AGWs in women was earlier, and the cumulative risk increased more quickly at a young age along with each subsequent younger birth cohort (P\u003C0.0001), whereas slight differences were observed in the different male birth cohorts (P=0.0785). The sexual behavior of individuals and their sexual partners had a strong relationship with self-reported AGWs. Our study indicates that the incidence of AGWs in China is as high as that in developed countries, and the data based on the national surveillance system seriously underestimate the real disease burden of AGWs.","publish_time":"2017-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Feixue; Sheng, Wei; Wu, Xin; Yin, Kai; Lan, Jian; Huang, Yue; Ma, Xinjing; Zheng, Ya; Zhuang, Sijie; Huang, Shoujie; Su, Yingying; Li, Mingqiang; Wu, Ting; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ningshao","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db7abfe9ffd34b558951907efa3be430d7bbf28b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5750456.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29259326/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2017.100","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsxNzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Notifiable Disease Report System","AGW"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["incidence of AGWs","self-reported AGWs","incidence rates of AGWs","diagnosis history of AGWs","data","prospective study","onset time of AGWs","NNDRS","cohort study","real disease burden of AGWs","self-reported diagnosis","reported AGW cases of Liuzhou","China","women","national surveillance system","incidence of anogenital warts","National Notifiable Disease Report System","sexual partners","subsequent younger birth cohort","person-years","sexual behavior of individuals","years old enrolled","AGW biopsy samples","different male birth cohorts","strong relationship","months","young age","Chinese general population","scheduled visits","confidence interval","enrollment visit","month intervals","slight differences","developed countries","cumulative risk","questionnaire survey","Human papillomavirus"],"language":"en"},

Although the mechanism(s) whereby FIPV causes disease are still incompletely understood, there have been significant contributions to the literature over the past decade which provide a framework upon which plausible explanations can be postulated. Two concepts are presented which attempt to clarify the pathogenesis of FIPV and at the same time may serve as an impetus for further research. The first involves the hypothesis, originally promulgated by Pedersen in 19891, that FIPV is derived from FECV during virus replication in the gastrointestinal tract. The second involves a unique mechanism of the mucosal immune system referred to as oral tolerance, which under normal conditions promotes the production of secretory immunity and suppresses the production of systematic immunity. In the case of FIPV infection, we propose that oral tolerance is important in the control of the virus at the gastrointestinal tract level. Once oral tolerance is disrupted, FIPV is capable of systemic spread resulting in immune-mediated vasculitis and death. Thus, it may be that clinical forms of FIP are due to a combination of two events, the first being the generation of FIPV from FECV, and the second being the capacity of FIPV to circumvent oral tolerance.","publish_time":"1991-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Evermann, James F.; McKeirnan, Alison J.; Ott, Richard L.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/741d7ee5f41c2dc5f55bd3f3ed51619a67e3b674.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/037811359190079U; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811359190079U","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pedersen"],"organizations":["FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of FIPV","generation of FIPV","capacity of FIPV","oral tolerance","case of FIPV infection","feline coronaviruses","feline infectious peritonisis virus","virus replication","FECV","production of secretory immunity","production of systematic immunity","gastrointestinal tract level","unique mechanism","mucosal immune system","immune-mediated vasculitis","teh epizootiology","normal conditions","capable of systemic spread","FEVC","control","current thoughts","framework","literature","primary emphasis","past decade","review","death","significant contributions","clinical forms of FIP","impetus","combination","events","plausible explanations","nature","Pedersen","time","disease","research","hypothesis","concepts"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The patients\u2019 demographic information, cancer history, treatment pattern, information about MERS-coronavirus (CoV) infection, history of travel, clinical symptoms, test results, and outcome were collected and analyzed as part of a quality improvement project to improve the care and safety of our patients. Only patients with confirmed infection were included. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were identified, with a median age of 66 years (range, 16-88 years), and 12 patients (63%) were males. The most common underlying disease was hematologic malignancies (47.4%), followed by colorectal cancer (21%) and lung cancer (15.8%). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities (57.9% and 52.6%, respectively). Infection was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab in all patients. All patients contracted the infection during their hospitalization for other reasons. Sixteen patients (80%) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 13 patients (81%) had acute respiratory distress syndrome, 11 were intubated (68.75%), 9 had acute renal injury (56.25%), and 3 required dialysis (18.75%). Only 3 patients (15.8%) with early-stage cancers survived. Patients with hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors had a 100% case fatality rate. The majority of the causes of death were due to multi-organ failure and septic shock. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection resulted in a high case fatality rate in patients with malignancy. Therefore, it is critical to implement effective primary preventive measures to avoid exposure of patients with cancer to the virus.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jazieh, Abdul-Rahman; Alenazi, Thamer H.; Alhejazi, Ayman; Al Safi, Faisal; Al Olayan, Ashwaq","journal":"JCO Glob Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21c1fb315716ec1e3930c51350ef05c922a05fac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124938.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1200/go.20.00064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196389/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["exposure of patients","outcome of affected patients","features of oncology patients","confirmed infection","MERS-CoV infection","cancer history","lung cancer","colorectal cancer","MERS-coronavirus","hematologic malignancies","years","high case fatality rate","acute respiratory distress syndrome","confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome","history of travel","clinical symptoms","clinical course","test results","common comorbidities","patients\u2019 demographic information","common underlying disease","intensive care unit","acute renal injury","treatment pattern","Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs-Riyadh","advanced solid tumors","effective primary preventive measures","multi-organ failure","causes of death","septic shock","diabetes mellitus","range","study","malignancy","median age","quality improvement project","outbreak","METHODS","safety","CONCLUSION","hospitalization","nasopharyngeal swab","early-stage cancers","majority","Hypertension","PURPOSE","reasons","total","required dialysis","males"],"language":"en"},

We have now cloned several mouse Bgp cDNAs from an outbred CDR-1 mouse colon cDNA library, as well as by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of colon RNA. The distinguishing features of the deduced Bgp protein isoforms are found in the two divergent N-terminal domains, the highly conserved internal C2-set immunoglobulin domains, and an intracytoplasmic domain of either 10 or 73 amino acids (aa). The cDNA structures suggest that these mRNAs are produced through alternative splicing of a Bgp gene and the usage of multiple transcriptional terminators. The Bgp deduced aa sequences are highly homologous to several well characterized rat hepatocyte proteins such as the cell CAM105/ecto-ATPase/ppl20/HA4 proteins. Oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes representing the various cDNA isoform domains revealed predominant transcripts of 1.8, 3.1 and 4.0 kb on Northern analyses of mouse colon RNA; some of these bands are actually composed of several co-migrating transcripts. The transcripts encoding the long intracytoplasmic-tailed Bgp proteins are expressed at one-tenth the relative abundance of the shorter-tailed species. We have previously demonstrated that several mouse Bgp cDNAs, when transfected into eukaryotic cells, express BGP proteins at the cell surface and function in vitro as cell adhesion molecules, much like their human and rat counterparts. The expression of the many Bgp isoforms at the surface of epithelial cells, such as colon, suggests that these proteins play a determinant role, through self- or heterologous contact, in renewal and/or differentiation of their epithelia.","publish_time":"1993-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCuaig, Kimberly; Rosenberg, Madelaine; N\u00E9dellec, Patrick; Turbide, Claire; Beauchemin, Nicole","journal":"Gene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28f87ecceb690e637ce9ac9135f11a6480f22f16.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811199390716G; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/037811199390716G","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Bgp gene","Bgp isoforms","express BGP proteins","mouse Bgp cDNAs","long intracytoplasmic-tailed Bgp proteins","deduced Bgp protein isoforms","HA4 proteins","mouse colon cDNA library","cell surface","Northern analyses of mouse colon RNA","characterized rat hepatocyte proteins","immunoglobulin domains","various cDNA isoform domains","cell CAM105","gene family","cDNA structures","predominant transcripts","cell adhesion molecules","surface of epithelial cells","reverse transcription-PCR amplification of colon RNA","co-migrating transcripts","divergent N-terminal domains","eukaryotic cells","intracytoplasmic domain","rat counterparts","aa sequences","human carcinoembryonic antigen","shorter-tailed species","outbred CDR","function","conserved internal C2","ecto-ATPase","ppl20","CEA","heterologous contact","determinant role","Oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes","distinguishing features","usage of multiple transcriptional terminators","renewal","mRNAs","member","alternative splicing","relative abundance","bands","amino acids","biliary glycoprotein","differentiation","expression"],"language":"en"},

Federal, state, and local public health responders must be able to plan for and respond to these events at aviation points of entry. The emergence of a novel influenza virus and its spread to the United States were simulated for February 2009 from 55 international metropolitan areas using three basic reproduction numbers (R(0)): 1.53, 1.70, and 1.90. Empirical data from the pH1N1 virus were used to validate our SEIR model. Time to entry to the U.S. during the early stages of a prototypical novel communicable disease was predicted based on the aviation network patterns and the epidemiology of the disease. For example, approximately 96% of origins (R(0) of 1.53) propagated a disease into the U.S. in under 75 days, 90% of these origins propagated a disease in under 50 days. An R(0) of 1.53 reproduced the pH1NI observations.

However, its well-designed management system faced a great challenge during the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. By examining the literature on the development of disaster management, we realized that enhancing self-organization in communities can effectively resolve problems caused by collective actions and strengthen resilience to disasters. In the decade since the Wenchuan earthquake, the literature has focused more on empowering communities during disaster management in China. However, literature on the compatibility of social resilience and the government-dominant model in China is still scant. This study investigates China\u2019s current disaster management system design; specifically, it identifies ways and methods for counteracting any conflicts between disaster management under social synergies and China\u2019s emergency management system. It further explores what factors facilitate the balance between social synergies and the emergency management system if the two concepts were fused together.

Recently, CHWs have been recognised as important players in the achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Despite this recognition, little understanding exists in Ghana about the activities of CHWs: who they are; how they are recruited; what they do; level of health policy support; contribution to healthcare delivery and the challenges they face. Based on a rapid scoping review of the existing literature, and our experience working in Ghana, this paper reflects on the role of CHWs in healthcare delivery in Ghana. We argue that CHWs have played critical roles in improving health service delivery and outcomes, including guinea worm eradication, expanded immunisation coverage, maternal and child health, and HIV/AIDS treatment and management. However, these achievements notwithstanding, CHWs face challenges which prevent them from being optimally productive, including capacity problems, neglect by the healthcare system, high attrition rates and inadequate supervision. Policymakers in Ghana therefore need to give increased attention to CHWs, provide remuneration for their activities, create career opportunities and other means of motivations to boost their productivity and sustain gains associated with their activities.","publish_time":"2016-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baatiema, Leonard; Sumah, Anthony Mwinkaara; Tang, Prosper Naazumah; Ganle, John Kuumuori","journal":"BMJ Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a9de698acd2aea68074eb45c0925d4377a41011.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5321387.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2016-000141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28588981/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United Nations","HIV/AIDS"],"locations":["Ghana"],"keyphrases":["activities of CHWs","role of CHWs","Ghana","CHWs face challenges","health service delivery","primary healthcare delivery","child health","healthcare system","level of health policy support","recognising community health workers","health-related Millennium Development Goals","immunisation coverage","contribution","guinea worm eradication","high attrition rates","neglect","HIV","outcomes","existing literature","middle income countries","remuneration","efforts","critical roles","inadequate supervision","career opportunities","capacity problems","AIDS treatment","means of motivations","rapid scoping review","idea","MDGs","experience","paper","increased attention","United Nations","little understanding","important players","productivity","agencies","management","recognition","achievements","gains","Policymakers"],"language":"en"},

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) deeply characterize the genetic diversity among rapidly mutating virus populations at the interspecific as well as the intraspecific level. The diversity of RNA viruses present in faeces of neonatal piglets suffering from diarrhoea in 47 farms, plus 4 samples from non-diarrhoeic piglets has been evaluated by NGS. Samples were selected among the cases submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories of Infectious Diseases of the Universitat Aut\u00F2noma de Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) and Universidad de Le\u00F3n (Le\u00F3n, Spain). RESULTS: The analyses identified the presence of 12 virus species corresponding to 8 genera of RNA viruses. Most samples were co-infected by several viruses. Kobuvirus and Rotavirus were more commonly reported, with Sapovirus, Astrovirus 3, 4 and 5, Enterovirus G, Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, Pasivirus and Posavirus being less frequently detected. Most sequences showed a low identity with the sequences deposited in GenBank, allowing us to propose several new VP4 and VP7 genotypes for Rotavirus B and Rotavirus C. CONCLUSIONS: Among the cases analysed, Rotaviruses were the main aetiological agents of diarrhoea in neonate pigs. Besides, in a small number of cases Kobuvirus and Sapovirus may also have an aetiological role. Even most animals were co-infected in early life, the association with enteric disease among the other examined viruses was unclear. The NGS method applied successfully characterized the RNA virome present in faeces and detected a high level of unreported intraspecific diversity.","publish_time":"2019-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cortey, Mart\u00ED; D\u00EDaz, Ivan; Vidal, Anna; Mart\u00EDn-Valls, Gerard; Franzo, Giovanni; G\u00F3mez de Nova, Pedro Jos\u00E9; Darwich, Laila; Puente, H\u00E9ctor; Carvajal, Ana; Mart\u00EDn, Marga; Mateu, Enric","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9fb16bb3df1fc1af7dd479e06c120f376362880.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6896758.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-2204-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31805938/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Kobuvirus"],"organizations":["Next Generation Sequencing","NGS","Universidad de Le\u00F3n"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["diversity of RNA viruses","genera of RNA viruses","examined viruses","samples","RNA virome present","Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","virus species","Rotavirus B","Barcelona","main aetiological agents of diarrhoea","neonate pigs","genetic diversity","Spain","Sapovirus","Le\u00F3n","intraspecific level","NGS method","sequences","high level of unreported intraspecific diversity","small number of cases Kobuvirus","mutating virus populations","faeces of neonatal piglets","aetiological role","major cause of death","non-diarrhoeic piglets","early life","Universitat Aut\u00F2noma","VP7 genotypes","Enterovirus G","Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories of Infectious Diseases","enteric disease","association","Pasivirus","Universidad","new VP4","presence","animals","Rotaviruses","Posavirus","farms","CONCLUSIONS","low identity","Astrovirus","analyses","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","GenBank","Generation Sequencing"],"language":"en"},

R. Br. (Apocynaceae), a wide used ethic-medicine in many Asia and Africa counties, has also been recorded as the common traditional Chinese medicine for treatment of illnesses in respiratory system by Dai people. Aim of the study To provide experimental data of clinical adaption of total indole alkaloids (TA) from leaf of A. scholaris for treating post-infectious cough in phase II clinical trial. Materials and methods To model post-infectious cough, all animals except control group were instilled intra-tracheal with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (80 \u03BCg/50 \u00B5L/mouse), followed by subsequent exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) for 30 min per day for a total of 30 days. Mice were orally given TA at dose of 10, 25, 50 mg/kg, and four main alkaloids (Sch: scholaricine, Epi: 19-epischolaricine, Val: vallesamine, Pic: picrinine) once daily. Cellular infiltration was assessed in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the serum was determined, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the serum and homogenate were examined. Finally, histopathological examination in the lungs was assessed by H. E. staining. Results After administration of TA and four major alkaloids respectively, the symptoms of cough in mice were obviously attenuated. Total white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils (NEU) amounts in BALF were reduced obviously and the pathological damage of lung was also attenuated. There was also significant reduction in IL-6, CRP, MDA and a marked improvement in SOD. Conclusions The efficacy of indole alkaloids against post-infectious cough (PIC) was shown in the down-regulation of inflammatory cells, cytokines, and the balance of antioxidants. What\u0027s more, the pharmacological effects of TA were better than single indole alkaloid, which might be related to the synergic effect of four major alkaloids.","publish_time":"2018-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Yun-Li; Yang, Zi-Feng; Shang, Jian-Hua; Huang, Wan-Yi; Wang, Bei; Wei, Xin; Khan, Afsar; Yuan, Zhi-Wei; Liu, Ya-Ping; Wang, Yi-Fen; Wang, Xin-Hua; Luo, Xiao-Dong","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fb382f0bd23aaf5f7cf648705119b6f9ad69cfa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126965.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29496577/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874117338175; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.02.040; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874117338175","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["R.

We discuss here the major reasons for the failure of \u201Cclassical\u201D vaccine approaches, which are mostly due to the biological properties of the virus itself. HIV-1 has developed multiple mechanisms of immune escape, which also account for vaccine failure. So far, no vaccine candidate has been able to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against primary patient viruses from different clades. However, such antibodies were identified in a subset of patients during chronic infection and were shown to protect from infection in animal models and to reduce viremia in first clinical trials. Their detailed characterization has guided structure-based reverse vaccinology approaches to design better HIV-1 envelope (Env) immunogens. Furthermore, conserved Env epitopes have been identified, which are promising candidates in view of clinical applications. Together with new vector-based technologies, considerable progress has been achieved in recent years towards the development of an effective antibody-based HIV-1 vaccine.","publish_time":"2018-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ringel, Oliver; Vieillard, Vincent; Debr\u00E9, Patrice; Eichler, Jutta; B\u00FCning, Hildegard; Dietrich, Ursula","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0e519e2224e5ee8dd2303ed3f347e049cb599a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5923491.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29662026/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10040197","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine approaches","effective antibody-based HIV","vaccine failure","vaccine candidate","design better HIV","chronic infection","effective antibody-based vaccines","multiple viruses","new vector-based technologies","reverse vaccinology approaches","neutralizing antibodies","chronic disease","clinical trials","primary patient viruses","number of new infections","view of clinical applications","conserved Env epitopes","multiple mechanisms of immune escape","human immunodeficiency virus type","considerable progress","structure","bnAbs","ART","envelope","development","success of anti-retroviral therapy","recent years","viremia","promising candidates","different clades","subset of patients","animal models","detailed characterization","major reasons","biological properties","immunogens"],"language":"en"},

This chapter discusses the pathogens that are transmitted through the environment such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Many human pathogens can be transmitted only by direct or close contact with an infected person or animal such as herpesvirus. Virus transmission by the airborne route may be both direct and indirect inhalation of infectious droplets or through contact with contaminated fomites. Water-borne diseases\u2014such as yellow fever, dengue, filariasis, malaria, onchocerciasis, and sleeping sicknessare transmitted by insects that breed in water or live near water. The common bacterial pathogens transmitted through water include Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, Vibrio, Helicobacter, and Legionella. Opportunistic pathogens are also numerous in the environment, and the most important opportunistic pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viruses are a leading cause of gastroenteritis and water-borne outbreaks may be caused by norovirus, hepatitis A virus, Coxsackie virus, echovirus, and adenoviruses. Respiratory diseases are also associated with a large number of viruses such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, and adenovirus. Generally, viral and protozoan pathogens survive longer in the environment than enteric bacterial pathogens.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gerba, Charles P.","journal":"Environmental Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8dd74d50263cfae8fa91821a0d0fc5a89e881299.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173582.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123705198000225; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123705198000225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Water","environment","Opportunistic pathogens","protozoan pathogens","human pathogens","Coxsackie virus","Virus transmission","enteric bacterial pathogens","common bacterial pathogens","respiratory syncytial virus","parainfluenza viruses","large number of viruses","Respiratory diseases","infected person","close contact","infected host","leading cause of gastroenteritis","microbes cause infection","important opportunistic pathogen","Campylobacter","Shigella","rhinoviruses","coronaviruses","Salmonella","indirect inhalation of infectious droplets","RSV","Escherichia coli","malaria","Vibrio","dengue","filariasis","Yersinia","yellow fever","small proportion","airborne route","onchocerciasis","Helicobacter","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","animal","norovirus","echovirus","hepatitis","Publisher Summary Pathogenic microorganisms","contaminated fomites","sicknessare","herpesvirus","outbreaks","adenoviruses","Legionella","insects"],"language":"en"},

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u201324.0]), or 23\u201324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u20134 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u201329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.","publish_time":"2015-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Ying-Hen","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/473207b36a728a21e7545bcde584d8618f714552.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4690341.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26713252/; https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1505","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQwLmNzdjs5ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1737684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WEYSjIOCtjbHA88d1W4GiA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_40.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","Asia","North Africa","Europe","Saudi Arabia","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak","South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak","recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak","South Korea outbreak","CoV infections","estimated outbreak","transmissibility of MERS","cases of MERS","past MERS-CoV outbreaks","cluster of nosocomial infections","turning point","nosocomial nature","cluster infections","large clusters of nosocomial infections","point of t","total cases","country-specific number of reported cases","onset date","days","estimate of R","control measures","basic reproduction number R","low community transmissibility","Richards model","index case","index patient","laboratory confirmation","outbreaks of infectious diseases","emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","simple mathematical model","timely intervention measures","superspreading events","crowded settings","peak incidence","temporal course","Saudi Arabia","SARS epidemic","Asia","importance","risk","North Africa","Europe","month","hospitals","deaths","order","occurrence","pinpoints","Discussion","Conclusion","Results","Background","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess the association. Subgroup analyses were performed by ethnicity. Sensitivity analyses were performed through employing different statistical models (fixed versus random effect model). Results: A total of nine papers and 12 studies, with 1520 severe dengue and 1496 clinical dengue infection were included. The overall meta-analysis revealed significant associations between rs4804803 and severe dengue under the recession (GG versus GA/AA: OR = 0.44, 95%CI, 0.23\u20130.82) and a codominant model (GG versus AA: OR = 0.43, 95%CI, 0.23\u20130.81), but sensitivity analysis indicated that the significant pooled ORs were not robust. The subgroup analysis suggested that the carrier of G in rs4804803 was a risk factor for severe dengue under dominant (GG/GA versus AA: OR = 1.86,95%CI, 1.01\u20133.45), superdominant (GA versus GG/AA: OR = 1.81,95%CI, 1.02\u20133.21) and a codominant (GA versus AA: OR=1.82,95%CI, 1.02\u20133.26) models in Asians, while it was a protective factor for severe dengue in South-central Americans under recessive (GG versus GA/AA: OR = 0.27,95%CI, 0.10\u20130.70) and codominant (GG versus AA: OR=0.24,95%CI, 0.09\u20130.64) models.

Type I interferons (IFN) are essential for mounting efficient antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses, but in a recent study, North American PRRSV genotype 2 isolates did not induce, or even strongly inhibited, IFN-\u03B1 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), representing \u201Cprofessional IFN-\u03B1-producing cells\u201D. Since inhibition of IFN-\u03B1 expression might initiate PRRSV pathogenesis, we further characterized PRRSV effects and host modifying factors on IFN-\u03B1 responses of pDC. Surprisingly, a variety of type 1 and type 2 PRRSV directly stimulated IFN-\u03B1 secretion by pDC. The effect did not require live virus and was mediated through the TLR7 pathway. Furthermore, both IFN-\u03B3 and IL-4 significantly enhanced the pDC production of IFN-\u03B1 in response to PRRSV exposure. PRRSV inhibition of IFN-\u03B1 responses from enriched pDC stimulated by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides was weak or absent. VR-2332, the prototype genotype 2 PRRSV, only suppressed the responses by 34%, and the highest level of suppression (51%) was induced by a Chinese highly pathogenic PRRSV isolate. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that pDC respond to PRRSV and suggest that suppressive activities on pDC, if any, are moderate and strain-dependent. Thus, pDC may be a source of systemic IFN-\u03B1 responses reported in PRRSV-infected animals, further contributing to the puzzling immunopathogenesis of PRRS.","publish_time":"2013-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baumann, Arnaud; Mateu, Enric; Murtaugh, Michael P; Summerfield, Artur","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af5ac6d8e177f588034d75237f65dc8d6c0deb2f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3672080.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-44-33; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23675981/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","CpG","PRRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IFN-\u03B1 responses of pDC","PRRSV inhibition of IFN","professional IFN-\u03B1","IFN-\u03B1 secretion","pDC production of IFN","PRRSV effects","PRRSV pathogenesis","PRRSV exposure","IFN-\u03B3","source of systemic IFN-\u03B1 responses","\u03B1 expression","enriched pDC","PRRSV-infected animals","pathogenic PRRSV isolate","North American PRRSV genotype","adaptive immune responses","variety of type","prototype genotype","live virus","plasmacytoid dendritic cells","puzzling immunopathogenesis of PRRS","recent study","viral shedding consistent","prolonged viremia","factors","respiratory syndrome","CpG oligodeoxynucleotides","infections","host","incomplete immunity","isolates","Chinese","IL","suppressive activities","highest level of suppression","strain-dependent","VR","interferons","findings","TLR7 pathway"],"language":"en"},

We included identified studies and reports summarizing national experience in implementing any of the IHR (2005) core capacities or their components. We excluded studies that were theoretical or referred to IHR (1969). Qualitative systematic review methodology, including meta-ethnography, was used for qualitative synthesis. FINDINGS: We analysed 51 articles from 77 countries representing all WHO Regions. The meta-syntheses identified a total of 44 lessons learnt across the eight core capacities of IHR (2005). Major themes included the need to mobilize and sustain political commitment; to adapt global requirements based on local sociocultural, epidemiological, health system and economic contexts; and to conduct baseline and follow-up assessments to monitor the status of IHR (2005) implementation. CONCLUSION: Although experiences of IHR (2005) implementation covered a wide global range, more documentation from Africa and Eastern Europe is needed. We did not find specific areas of weakness in monitoring IHR (2005); sustained monitoring of all core capacities is required to ensure effective systems. These lessons learnt could be adapted by countries in the process of meeting IHR (2005) requirements.","publish_time":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suthar, Amitabh B; Allen, Lisa G; Cifuentes, Sara; Dye, Christopher; Nagata, Jason M","journal":"Bull World Health Organ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55123f88b470c8d819d169865c7fada386ee7821.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5791773.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29403114/; https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.16.189100","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Assembly","Global Health","World Health Organization","Global Index Medicus","International Society"],"locations":["Africa","Eastern Europe"],"keyphrases":["IHR Implementation","monitoring IHR","status of IHR","core capacities of IHR","experiences of IHR","Global Health","process of meeting IHR","health system","global requirements","countries","World Health Organization","World Health Assembly","International Health Regulations","Global Index Medicus","wide global range","dissemination of lessons","identified studies","meta-ethnography","International Society","sustained monitoring","systematic search","Qualitative systematic review methodology","meta-syntheses","qualitative synthesis","following online databases","documentation","PubMed","Scopus","sources","Africa","economic contexts","Embase","national experience","need","baseline","reports","political commitment","specific areas of weakness","revision","follow-up assessments","Disease Surveillance","Eastern Europe","total","effective systems","Major themes","articles","CONCLUSION","components","FINDINGS","OBJECTIVE","Regions","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

First, they acquired a domain to bind to a specific cellular protein, named \u201Creceptor.\u201D Second, they developed, with the help of cellular proteins, a function of finely controlled fusion to optimize the replication and preserve the integrity of the cell, specific to the genus of the virus. Following the activation of the EnvGP either by binding to their receptors and/or sometimes the acid pH of the endosomes, many changes of conformation permit ultimately the action of a specific hydrophobic domain, the fusion peptide, which destabilizes the cell membrane and leads to the opening of the lipidic membrane. The comprehension of these mechanisms is essential to develop medicines of the therapeutic class of entry inhibitor like enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this chapter, we will summarize the different envelope glycoprotein structures that viruses develop to achieve membrane fusion and the entry of the virus. We will describe the different entry pathways and cellular proteins that viruses have subverted to allow infection of the cell and the receptors that are used. Finally, we will illustrate more precisely the recent discoveries that have been made within the field of the entry process, with a focus on the use of pseudoparticles. These pseudoparticles are suitable for high-throughput screenings that help in the development of natural or artificial inhibitors as new therapeutics of the class of entry inhibitors.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cosset, Fran\u00E7ois-Loic; Lavillette, Dimitri","journal":"Advances in Genetics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3dfe7e3a4c98dbb3fcd0e08fbc27815f8123854e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149602.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123808608000045; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123808608000045; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-380860-8.00004-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310296/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell membrane","membrane fusion","entry process","class of entry inhibitors","cell targets","lipidic membrane","fusion process","different entry pathways","fusion peptide","controlled fusion","specific cellular protein","help of cellular proteins","therapeutic class of entry inhibitor","specific hydrophobic domain","human immunodeficiency virus","EnvGP","envelope glycoproteins","receptors","Abstract Enveloped viruses","artificial inhibitors","different envelope glycoprotein structures","use of pseudoparticles","viral glycoproteins","enfuvirtide","new therapeutics","Fuzeon","development of natural","action","medicines","function","high-throughput screenings","endosomes","focus","opening","changes of conformation","mechanisms","acid pH","replication","order","HIV","binding","integrity","merging","infection","genus","comprehension","activation","field","recent discoveries","features","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we report enzyme inhibition of a structurally related compound, trimethylaurintricarboxylic acid (NSC97317) that showed a low micromolar inhibition of DNMT1 (IC(50) = 4.79 \u03BCM). Docking studies of the new inhibitor with the catalytic domain of DNMT1 suggest that NSC97317 can bind into the catalytic site. Interactions with amino acid residues that participate in the mechanism of DNA methylation contribute to the binding recognition. In addition, NSC97317 had a good match with a structure-based pharmacophore model recently developed for inhibitors of DNMT1.

One such strategy involves using the different immune routes with DNA vaccines. In the present study, the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine, induced by using the current routine vaccination routes (intramuscularly, by electroporation, or orally using live-attenuated Salmonella typhimurium), was compared in mouse model. The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that immunization intramuscularly induced a moderate T cell response and antibody response. Mice administrated by electroporation induced the highest antibody response among the three immunization groups and a mid-level of cellular response. In contrast, the orally DNA vaccine evoked vigorous T cell response and a weak antibody production. These results indicated that the distinct types of immune responses were generated by the different routes of DNA immunization. In addition, our results also show that the delivery of DNA vaccines by electroporation and orally using live-attenuated Salmonella in vivo is an effective method to increase the immune responses. Further studies could be carried out using a combination strategy of both oral and electroporation immunizations to stimulate higher cellular and humoral immune responses.","publish_time":"2009-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Hui; Huang, Xianqing; Tao, Ling; Huang, Yi; Cui, Bao-an; Wang, Hanzhong","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a1dd8ceedf59e4e8746320cdac85836e6cfc751.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115532.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X09000590; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.01.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X09000590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19186202/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different routes of DNA immunization","immunogenicity of DNA vaccines","different immune routes","delivery of DNA vaccines","highest antibody response","humoral immune responses","vigorous T cell response","moderate T cell response","electroporation immunizations","CoV nucleocapsid DNA vaccine","mid-level of cellular response","distinct types of immune responses","immunization groups","current routine vaccination routes","results","live-attenuated Salmonella typhimurium","weak antibody production","immunogenicity of SARS","combination strategy","effective method","present study","clinical utility","development of strategies","Mice","comparison","contrast","mouse model","addition","studies"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: In 4 years and 4 months, 376 AEs, including 252 severe (67%), were recorded, 83 of which occurred following an injection of Prevenar 13(\u00AE) alone: 39 cutaneous AEs, 16 neurological AEs, four cases of collapse or shock, nine cases of fever, and one of thrombocytopenia.

Specifically, we determined values of 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of MERS-CoV for the 2 strains of mice, compared and correlated their levels of soluble (s)hDPP4 expression to susceptibility, and explored recombinant (r)shDPP4 as an effective MCM for MERS infection. RESULTS: hDPP4(\u002B/\u002B) mice were unexpectedly more resistant than hDPP4(\u002B/\u2212) mice to MERS-CoV infection, as judged by increased LD(50), reduced lung viral infection, attenuated morbidity and mortality, and reduced histopathology. Additionally, the resistance to MERS-CoV infection directly correlated with increased serum shDPP4 and serum virus neutralizing activity. Finally, administration of rshDPP4 led to reduced lung virus titer and histopathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies suggest that the serum shDPP4 levels play a role in MERS pathogenesis and demonstrate a potential of rshDPP4 as a treatment option for MERS. Additionally, it offers a validated pair of Tg mice strains for characterizing the effect of shDPP4 on MERS pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2018-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Algaissi, Abdullah; Agrawal, Anurodh S; Han, Song; Peng, Bi-Hung; Luo, Chuming; Li, Fang; Chan, Teh-Sheng; Couch, Robert B; Tseng, Chien-Te K","journal":"The Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d87eaf5267713f57c2f641af840bde500716dc00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6376904.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/219/5/829/27785783/jiy574.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30256968/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy574","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS infection","MERS-CoV infection","understanding of MERS pathogenesis","effect of hDPP4","strains of mice","effect of shDPP4","serum shDPP4 levels","increased serum shDPP4","hDPP4 expression","transgenic mice","reduced lung viral infection","serum virus","reduced histopathology","reduced lung virus titer","validated pair of Tg mice strains","increased LD","effective MCM","potential of rshDPP4","levels of soluble","administration of rshDPP4","development of effective medical countermeasures","attenuated morbidity","ongoing Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","susceptibility","mortality","infections","explored recombinant","MCMs","threats","role","public health","human dipeptidyl peptidase","BACKGROUND","treatment option","studies","activity","lethal dose","resistance","values","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a critical role for immune homeostasis, but may inhibit pathogen-specific immunity in infectious disorders. The present review summarizes the current knowledge about Treg in human CNS infections and their animal models. Besides dampening pathogen-induced immunopathology, Treg have the ability to facilitate protective responses by supporting effector T cell trafficking to the infection site and the development of resident memory T cells. Moreover, Treg can reduce virus replication by inducing apoptosis of infected macrophages and attenuate neurotoxic astrogliosis and pro-inflammatory microglial responses. By contrast, detrimental effects of Treg are caused by suppression of antiviral immunity, allowing for virus persistence and latency. Opposing disease outcomes following Treg manipulation in different models might be attributed to differences in technique and timing of intervention, infection route, genetic background, and the host\u2019s age. In addition, mouse models of virus-induced demyelination revealed that Treg are able to reduce autoimmunity and immune-mediated CNS damage in a disease phase-dependent manner. Understanding the unique properties of Treg and their complex interplay with effector cells represents a prerequisite for the development of new therapeutic approaches in neurotropic virus infections.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ciurkiewicz, Malgorzata; Herder, Vanessa; Beineke, Andreas","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c8c094a83e54d4a3f6fba2fc8a4b95f889c062c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7084400.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32131483/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21051705","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsxNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Treg manipulation","detrimental effects of Treg","unique properties of Treg","neurotropic virus infections","mouse models of virus","virus replication","effector cells","virus persistence","Regulatory T cells","human CNS infections","different models","development of resident memory T cells","animal models","immune-mediated CNS damage","effector T cell trafficking","pathogen-specific immunity","infection site","infection route","protective responses","induced demyelination","disease outcomes","dampening pathogen-induced immunopathology","Neurotropic viruses","immune homeostasis","suppression of antiviral immunity","development of new therapeutic approaches","pro-inflammatory microglial responses","disease phase-dependent manner","neurotoxic astrogliosis","current knowledge","genetic background","timing of intervention","prerequisite","complex interplay","autoimmunity","apoptosis of infected macrophages","central nervous system","differences","ability","critical role","technique","infectious disorders","present review","chronic neurologic disabilities","host\u2019s age","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Saikosaponins (SSs, especially SSa, SSc and SSd), as the major bioactive compounds in RB, represent anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-viral and hepatoprotective effects. Purpose To summarize recent findings regarding to the extraction, detection, biosynthesis, metabolism, pharmacological/toxicological effects of SSs. Methods Online academic databases (including PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science and CNKI) were searched using search terms of \u201CSaikosaponin\u201D, \u201CRadix Bupleuri\u201D, \u201CBupleurum\u201D and combinations to include published studies of SSs primarily from 2003 to 2018. Several critical previous studies beyond this period were also included. Results 354 papers were found and 165 papers were reviewed. SSs have drawn great attention for their anti-inflammation, anti-viral and anti-cancer effects and contradictory roles in the regulation of cell apoptosis, oxidative stress and liver fibrosis. Meanwhile, increased risks of overdose-induced acute or accumulation-related chronic hepatotoxicity of SSs and RB have also been reported. However, underlying mechanisms of SSs bioactivities, the metabolism of SSs and bioactivities of SSs metabolites are largely unknown. Conclusion This comprehensive review of SSs provides novel insights and perspectives on the limitations of current studies and the importance of metabolism study and the dose-pharmacological/toxic relationship of SSs for the future discovery of SSs-based therapeutic strategies and clinical safe practice.","publish_time":"2018-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xiaojiaoyang; Li, Xiaoyu; Huang, Nana; Liu, Runping; Sun, Rong","journal":"Phytomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3ac6824636f168d44e1d78f82e6c22e4d49c913.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126585.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711318304550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30466994/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2018.09.174; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711318304550","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Radix Bupleuri","Saikosaponins"],"organizations":["Traditional Medicine"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["metabolism of SSs","toxicological effects of SSs","published studies of SSs","bioactivities of SSs metabolites","future discovery of SSs","toxic relationship of SSs","comprehensive review of SSs","underlying mechanisms of SSs bioactivities","anti-oxidant","anti-inflammation","anti-tumor","anti-cancer effects","accumulation-related chronic hepatotoxicity of SSs","RB","hepatoprotective effects","papers","importance of metabolism study","limitations of current studies","critical previous studies","dose-pharmacological","Wan tablets","Abstract Background Radix Bupleuri","Shu-Gan tablets","regulation of cell apoptosis","contradictory roles","anti-inflammatory","therapeutic strategies","PubMed","Google Scholar","oxidative stress","novel insights","perspectives","Xiao-Yao","CNKI","extraction","detection","biosynthesis","academic databases","Web of Science","liver fibrosis","Chai-Hu","clinical safe practice","major bioactive compounds","great attention","years","SSd","China","Bupleurum","SSa","combinations","recent findings","increased risks of overdose","Chinese Traditional Medicine","search terms","Methods","period","SSc","Conclusion","Purpose"],"language":"en"},

We previously generated a genogroup 2b (G2b) PEDV Taiwan Pintung 52 (PEDVPT) strain, PEDVPT-P96, and determined its promising host immune response against the virulent PEDVPT-P5 strain. To study the attenuation determinants of PEDVPT-P96 and establish a PEDVPT-P96-based recombinant vector as a vaccine platform for further antigenicity modification, iPEDVPT-P96, a full-length cDNA clone of PEDVPT-P96, was established. Comparing to the parental PEDVPT-P96 virus, the iPEDVPT-P96 virus showed efficient replication kinetics with a delayed decline of viral load and similar but much more uniform plaque sizes in Vero cells. In the 5-week-old piglet model, fecal viral shedding was observed in the PEDVPT-P96-inoculated piglets, whereas those inoculated with iPEDVPT-P96 showed neither detectable fecal viral shedding nor PEDV-associated clinical signs. Moreover, inoculation with iPEDVPT-P96 elicited comparable levels of anti-PEDV specific plasma IgG and fecal/salivary IgA, neutralizing antibody titers, and similar but less effective immunoprotection against the virulent PEDVPT-P5 challenge compared to the parental PEDVPT-P96. In the present study, an infectious cDNA clone of an attenuated G2b PEDV strain was successfully generated for the first time, and the in vitro and in vivo data indicate that iPEDVPT-P96 is further attenuated but remains immunogenic compared to its parental PEDVPT-P96 viral stock. The successful development of the iPEDVPT-P96 cDNA clone could allow for the manipulation of the viral genome to study viral pathogenesis and facilitate the rapid development of effective vaccines.","publish_time":"2018-10-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kao, Chi-Fei; Chiou, Hue-Ying; Chang, Yen-Chen; Hsueh, Cheng-Shun; Jeng, Chian-Ren; Tsai, Pei-Shiue; Cheng, Ivan-Chen; Pang, Victor Fei; Chang, Hui-Wen","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2813c9a864720f35199261a3ab219750d3a5daeb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6213177.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30287770/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10100543","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjsyMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV Taiwan Pintung"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parental PEDVPT-P96 virus","iPEDVPT-P96 virus","parental PEDVPT-P96 viral stock","iPEDVPT-P96 cDNA clone","full-length cDNA clone of PEDVPT","virulent PEDVPT-P5 strain","attenuation determinants of PEDVPT","virulent PEDVPT-P5 challenge","viral pathogenesis","viral genome","detectable fecal viral shedding","attenuated G2b PEDV strain","PEDV Taiwan Pintung","infectious cDNA clone","delayed decline of viral load","present study","rapid development of effective vaccines","comparable levels of anti-PEDV specific plasma IgG","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","effective immunoprotection","available vaccines","successful development","major challenge","inoculated piglets","efficient replication kinetics","salivary IgA","global swine industries","unreliable protection","vaccine platform","great threat","uniform plaque sizes","promising host immune response","antibody titers","week-old piglet model","antigenicity modification","recombinant vector","Vero cells","manipulation","clinical signs","genogroup","inoculation","data","time"],"language":"en"},

Within 3-1/2 months since outbreak in December 2019, over 1.3 million people have been infected across 206 countries with over 70,000 deaths. COVID-19 has a size of 60-140nm with mean size of the nano-aerosols, 100nm. The virus can be airborne by attaching to human secretion (fine particles, nasal/saliva droplets) of infected person or suspended fine particulates in air. While NIOSH has standardized N95 and N98 at 300nm, to-date there is no filter standards, nor special filter technologies, tailored for capturing airborne viruses and 100nm nano-aerosols. The latter also are present in high number concentration in atmospheric pollutants. This study addresses developing novel charged PVDF nanofiber filter technology to effectively capture the deadly airborne coronavirus with our target set at 100nm (nano-aerosol), and not 300nm. The virus and its attached particle were simulated by sodium chloride aerosols, 50-500nm, generated from sub-micron aerosol generator. PVDF nanofibers were produced with fiber diameters 84, 191, 349 and 525nm with excellent morphology. The fibers were subsequently charged by corona discharge. The amounts of charged fibers in a filter were increased to achieve high efficiency of 90% for the virus filter but the electrical interference between neighbouring fibers resulted in progressively marginal increase in efficiency and concurrently much higher pressure drop across the filter. The quality factor which measured the efficiency-to-pressure-drop kept decreasing. By redistributing the fibers in the filter into several modules, each separated by a permeable scrim material, the electrical interference was reduced, if not fully mitigated. Also, the additional scrim materials introduced macropores into the filter that further reduced the airflow resistance. With this approach, the quality factor can maintain relatively constant with increasing fiber amounts to achieve high filter efficiency. The optimal amounts of fiber in each module depended on the diameter of fibers in the module. Small fiber diameter that has already high performance required small amount of fibers per module. In contrast, large diameter fiber required more amounts of fiber per module to compensate for the poorer performance without incurring higher pressure drop. This approach was applied to develop four new nanofiber filters tailored for capturing 100nm airborne COVID-19 to achieve over 90% efficiency with pressure drop below 30Pa (3.1mm water). One filter developed meeting the 90% efficiency has ultralow pressure drop of only 18Pa (1.9mm water) while another filter meeting the 30Pa limit has high efficiency reaching 94%. These optimized filters based on rigorous engineering approach provide the badly needed technology for protecting the general public from the deadly airborne COVID-19 and other viruses, and nano-aerosols from air pollution which lead to chronic diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woon Fong Leung, Wallace; Sun, Qiangqiang","journal":"Sep Purif Technol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a78b73d62c651093203e1ad4156155f8ee55997.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7175919.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1383586620313605; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383586620313605?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32322159/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116886","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjszNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","NIOSH","PVDF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high filter efficiency","virus filter","filter standards","high efficiency","nm airborne COVID","nm nano-aerosols","diameter of fibers","special filter technologies","amounts of charged fibers","novel charged PVDF nanofiber filter technology","increasing fiber amounts","optimal amounts of fiber","Small fiber diameter","deadly airborne COVID","high performance","fiber diameters","airborne viruses","neighbouring fibers","higher pressure","large diameter fiber","deadly airborne coronavirus","ultralow pressure","high number concentration","novel coronavirus","electrical interference","sodium chloride aerosols","Pa limit","quality factor","outbreak","water","new nanofiber filters","rigorous engineering approach","needed technology","fine particles","infected person","air pollution","PVDF nanofibers","poorer performance","optimized filters","mean size","suspended fine particulates","permeable scrim material","additional scrim materials","sub-micron aerosol generator","nasal","saliva droplets","general public","study addresses","human secretion","target","atmospheric pollutants","attached particle","marginal increase","World Health Organization","macropores","chronic diseases","N95","N98","contrast","modules","date","countries","NIOSH","kept decreasing","corona discharge","excellent morphology","airflow resistance","people","deaths","pandemic","months"],"language":"en"},

Le d\u00E9veloppement spectaculaire des d\u00E9partements assurance qualit\u00E9 et contr\u00F4le qualit\u00E9, ces quinze derni\u00E8res ann\u00E9es, t\u00E9moignent de cette \u00E9volution. Summary The industrial development of vaccine manufacturing expanded during the second half of the 20th century. Vaccines are medicines which target healthy people. The active principles of vaccines arise from live organisms and can be distinguished from standard pharmaceutical compounds by their extreme complexity. The properties of vaccines depend mainly of the manufacturing process and it common to state that \u201Cthe process makes the product\u201D. The manufacturing is done in confined rooms because of the pathogenic characters of the organisms involved. Raw materials are subjected to rigorous controls to guarantee the integrity of products towards non-conventional agents like prion. The vaccine industry is characterized by the length of the manufacturing cycle. The complexity of the products implies heavy quality controls, which represent 75% of the total duration of the manufacture cycle. As a key element of public health, the vaccine production can be subjected to variations and adaptations, in particular in the context of outbreaks or bioterrorism. The vaccine industry must integrate the regulatory requirements, which are more and more pressing. The spectacular development of the quality assurance and quality control departments these last 15 years testifies to this evolution.","publish_time":"2009-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Speck, D.","journal":"Annales Pharmaceutiques Fran\u00E7aises","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c713dab28b2db7365ecd054370aa4fb0966d4a14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094674.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003450909000431; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003450909000431","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQxLmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709382,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"SZsmVdlGysq0fPfFEW96lA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_41.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["state"],"keyphrases":["The complexity","the length","The properties","the process makes the product","the manufacturing cycle","the manufacturing process","the quality assurance","the manufacture cycle","the organisms involved","The spectacular development","the total duration","the pathogenic characters","The active principles","The vaccine industry must integrate the regulatory requirements","Summary The industrial development","The vaccine industry is characterized","in particular in the context","the vaccine production can be subjected to variations","the products implies heavy quality controls","vaccine manufacturing expanded during the second half","subjected to rigorous controls to guarantee the integrity","production de vaccin","The manufacturing is done in confined rooms because","industrie du vaccin","coups de production","monde du vaccin","proc\u00E9d\u00E9 de production mis","it common to","which represent","d\u00E9partements assurance qualit\u00E9","contr\u00F4le qualit\u00E9","celle des contr\u00F4les qualit\u00E9","dur\u00E9e du cycle total de fabrication","years testifies to this evolution","from live organisms","vaccines depend mainly","int\u00E9grit\u00E9 des produits vis","products towards","quality control departments these","agents transmissibles","conventional agents like prion","contr\u00F4les rigoureux","more pressing","sant\u00E9 publique","autorit\u00E9s de sant\u00E9","complexit\u00E9 des produits","can be distinguished from standard pharmaceutical compounds","medicines which target healthy people","their extreme complexity","vis de contaminants viraux","adaptations","that","public health","outbreaks or bioterrorism","structures mol\u00E9culaires","caract\u00E8res pathog\u00E8nes","key element","Raw materials","d\u00E9veloppement spectaculaire","th century","fonction de la demande ext\u00E9rieure","moiti\u00E9","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie","contextes","particulier","zones confin\u00E9es","derni\u00E8res ann\u00E9es","activit\u00E9","exigences","\u0153uvre","\u00E9chelle industrielle","plupart des microorganismes impliqu\u00E9s","chimie classique","mal identifi\u00E9es","mati\u00E8res premi\u00E8res","\u00E9l\u00E9ment majeur","longueur des cycles","xx e si\u00E8cle","essor","propri\u00E9t\u00E9s de la pr\u00E9paration vaccinale","moyenne","menaces de bioterrorisme","sujets","particularit\u00E9","principes actifs","organismes vivants","\u00E9volution","m\u00E9dicament","parall\u00E8le","R\u00E9sum\u00E9"],"language":"fr"},

Importin-\u03B13 promoter activity is regulated by TNF-\u03B1-induced NF-\u03BAB in a concentration-dependent manner.

Therefore, the weight threshold for admission to the adult ICU was lowered to 20 kg. Neonatal intensive care units (NICU) should remain, if possible, low viral density areas. Mixed (neonatal and pediatric) intensive care units could be dedicated to infants and children only. NICU admission of extreme premature babies should be limited in this difficult situation. Pediatric intensive care units (PICU) admission capacity could be doubled by using intermediate care and postoperative care units.

Several antiviral drugs are approved to treat HCMV infections. However, resistant HCMV mutants can arise in patients receiving long-term therapy. Additionally, side effects and the risk to cause birth defects limit the use of currently approved antivirals against HCMV. Therefore, the identification of new drug targets is of clinical relevance. Recent work identified DNA-damage binding protein 1 (DDB1) and the family of the cellular cullin (Cul) RING ubiquitin (Ub) ligases (CRLs) as host-derived factors that are relevant for the replication of human and mouse cytomegaloviruses. The first-in-class CRL inhibitory compound Pevonedistat (also called MLN4924) is currently under investigation as an anti-tumor drug in several clinical trials. Cytomegaloviruses exploit CRLs to regulate the abundance of viral proteins, and to induce the proteasomal degradation of host restriction factors involved in innate and intrinsic immunity. Accordingly, pharmacological blockade of CRL activity diminishes viral replication in cell culture. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge concerning the relevance of DDB1 and CRLs during cytomegalovirus replication and discuss chances and drawbacks of CRL inhibitory drugs as potential antiviral treatment against HCMV.","publish_time":"2019-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Becker, Tanja; Le-Trilling, Vu Thuy Khanh; Trilling, Mirko","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f1e08abe8648487cc1738dac17cb2adb25cffe7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6479302.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30986950/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20071636","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCMV","CRL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CRLs","HCMV infections","viral replication","cytomegalovirus replication","replication of human","resistant HCMV mutants","drawbacks of CRL inhibitory drugs","relevance of DDB1","antiviral drugs","clinical relevance","Human cytomegalovirus","host-derived factors","class CRL inhibitory compound Pevonedistat","pharmacological blockade of CRL activity","AIDS patients","insufficient immunity","clinical trials","intrinsic immunity","mouse cytomegaloviruses","approved antivirals","proteasomal degradation of host restriction factors","potential antiviral treatment","anti-tumor drug","abundance of viral proteins","identification of new drug targets","chances","RING ubiquitin","DNA-damage binding protein","morbidity","cellular cullin","mortality","ligases","Recent work","cell culture","birth defects","individuals","investigation","family","MLN4924","current knowledge","recipients","ubiquitous betaherpesvirus","risk","infected newborns","long-term therapy","effects","review"],"language":"en"},

In addition, about 82 million metric tons of eggs were produced. One of the bases for this production is the reproductive efficiency of today\u0027s poultry. This, in turn, is due to their inherent reproductive physiology, intensive genetic selection and advances in husbandry/management. The system of reproduction in males in largely similar to that in mammals except that there is no descent of testes. In females, there are marked differences with there being a single ovary and oviduct; the latter being the name of the differentiated entire M\u00FCllerian duct. Moreover, females produce eggs with a yolky oocyte surrounded by albumen, membranes and shell. Among the most successful reproductive management techniques are optimizing photoperiod, light intensity and nutrition. Widespread employment of these has allowed maximizing production. Laying hens can be re-cycled toward the end egg production. Other aspects of reproductive management in poultry include the following: artificial insemination (almost exclusively employed in turkeys) and approaches to reduce broodiness together with cage free (colony), conventional, enriched and free-range systems.","publish_time":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scanes, Colin G.; Butler, Leasea D.; Kidd, Michael T.","journal":"Animal Agriculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a5aa39108c02e8baa292d13d13466c52a2c96e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7153309.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128170526000203; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128170526000203","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjsyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aspects of reproductive management","successful reproductive management techniques","reproductive efficiency of today\u0027s poultry","inherent reproductive physiology","metric tons of poultry meat","metric tons of eggs","maximizing production","females","end egg production","intensive genetic selection","photoperiod","advances","Agricultural Organization","husbandry","yolky oocyte","following","UN\u0027s Food","light intensity","broodiness","data","cage free","colony","albumen","membranes","artificial insemination","single ovary","differentiated entire M\u00FCllerian duct","nutrition","differences","system of reproduction","Widespread employment","mammals","oviduct","free-range systems","shell","turkeys","Abstract","hens","addition","bases","descent of testes","turn"],"language":"en"},

However, limited information has been available on CD8\u002B T cell epitopes or the functionality of antigen specific T cells during infection or following immunization with experimental vaccines. Peptide panels from HSV-2 proteins ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 were selected from in silico predictions of binding to human HLA-A*0201 and mouse H-2Kd, Ld and Dd molecules. Nine previously uncharacterized CD8\u002B T cell epitopes were identified from HSV-2 infected BALB/c mice. HSV-2 specific peptide sequences stabilized HLA-A*02 surface expression with intermediate or high affinity binding. Peptide specific CD8\u002B human T cell lines from peripheral blood lymphocytes were generated from a HLA-A*02\u002B donor. High frequencies of peptide specific CD8\u002B T cell responses were elicited in mice by DNA vaccination with ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14, as demonstrated by CD107a mobilization. Vaccine driven T cell responses displayed a more focused immune response than those induced by viral infection. Furthermore, vaccination with ICP27 reduced viral shedding and reduced the clinical impact of disease. In conclusion, this study describes novel HSV-2 epitopes eliciting strong CD8\u002B T cell responses that may facilitate epitope based vaccine design and aid immunomonitoring of antigen specific T cell frequencies in preclinical and clinical settings.","publish_time":"2013-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Platt, Rebecca J.; Khodai, Tansi; Townend, Tim J.; Bright, Helen H.; Cockle, Paul; Perez-Tosar, Luis; Webster, Rob; Champion, Brian; Hickling, Timothy P.; Mirza, Fareed","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de95f39159534068d4a1aef3e5d6a884d1c39656.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3972665.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709642/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells2010019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cell epitopes","human T cell lines","Vaccine driven T cell responses","aid immunomonitoring of antigen specific T cell frequencies","functionality of antigen specific T cells","High frequencies of peptide specific CD8","strong CD8","uncharacterized CD8","specific peptide sequences","novel HSV","human HLA","Peptide panels","viral infection","proteins ICP27","VP22","VP13","high affinity binding","vaccine design","viral shedding","clinical settings","c mice","DNA vaccination","silico predictions of binding","clinical impact of disease","peripheral blood lymphocytes","surface expression","Kd","Ld","immunization","focused immune response","potential","infected BALB","study","mouse H","Dd molecules","experimental vaccines","conclusion","limited information","CD107a mobilization","donor"],"language":"en"},

In contrast, the nucleocapsid (N) gene of TW IBV presents phylogenetic incongruence. RNA recombination at the 5\u2032 end of the N gene between TW and US IBV is shown to be responsible for this discordance. Surprisingly, the recombinant N gene is found in all of tested TW IBV isolates, suggesting that a recombination event gave origin to a founder lineage.

Bats are also major hosts for biological agents responsible for zoonoses, such as coronaviruses (CoVs). The islands of the Western Indian Ocean are identified as a major biodiversity hotspot, with more than 50 bat species. In this study, we tested 1,013 bats belonging to 36 species from Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island and Seychelles, based on molecular screening and partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. In total, 88 bats (8.7%) tested positive for coronaviruses, with higher prevalence in Mozambican bats (20.5% \u00B1 4.9%) as compared to those sampled on islands (4.5% \u00B1 1.5%). Phylogenetic analyses revealed a large diversity of \u03B1- and \u03B2-CoVs and a strong signal of co-evolution between CoVs and their bat host species, with limited evidence for host-switching, except for bat species sharing day roost sites. These results highlight that strong variation between islands does exist and is associated with the composition of the bat species community on each island. Future studies should investigate whether CoVs detected in these bats have a potential for spillover in other hosts.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joffrin, L\u00E9a; Goodman, Steven M.; Wilkinson, David A.; Ramasindrazana, Beza; Lagadec, Erwan; Gomard, Yann; Le Minter, Gildas; Dos Santos, Andr\u00E9a; Corrie Schoeman, M.; Sookhareea, Rajendraprasad; Tortosa, Pablo; Julienne, Simon; Gudo, Eduardo S.; Mavingui, Patrick; Lebarbenchon, Camille","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22c4711a7cea0790b4c412f82eefe57f6bfdf0fc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5f7f49376f66bea45e57b97c1079cd4b08bd937f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7181612.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327721/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63799-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQyLmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734805,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:26Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ygcln9zPZINTQtvdSE9nUg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_42.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Western Indian Ocean"],"keyphrases":["bat host species","Mozambican bats","bat species community","islands","\u03B2-CoVs","major hosts","coronaviruses","Reunion Island","strong variation","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene","major biodiversity hotspot","strong signal of co-evolution","crop pest regulation","seed dispersal","pollination","Mayotte","Mauritius","zoonoses","key ecosystem services","biological agents responsible","partial sequencing","large diversity of \u03B1","Seychelles","molecular screening","Madagascar","higher prevalence","Mozambique","limited evidence","Western Indian Ocean","day roost sites","Phylogenetic analyses","soil fertilization","results","potential","spillover","composition","Future studies","study","total"],"language":"en"},

The risk of widespread epidemics in humans can be assessed by monitoring the reproduction number R (average number of persons infected by a human case). However, until now, estimating R required detailed outbreak investigations of human clusters, for which resources and expertise are not always available. Additionally, existing methods do not correct for important selection and under-ascertainment biases. Here, we present simple estimation methods that overcome many of these limitations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Our approach is based on a parsimonious mathematical model of disease transmission and only requires data collected through routine surveillance and standard case investigations. We apply it to assess the transmissibility of swine-origin influenza A H3N2v-M virus in the US, Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and also present a non-zoonotic example (cholera in the Dominican Republic). Estimation is based on two simple summary statistics, the proportion infected by the natural reservoir among detected cases (G) and among the subset of the first detected cases in each cluster (F). If detection of a case does not affect detection of other cases from the same cluster, we find that R can be estimated by 1\u2212G; otherwise R can be estimated by 1\u2212F when the case detection rate is low. In more general cases, bounds on R can still be derived. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a simple approach with limited data requirements that enables robust assessment of the risks posed by emerging zoonoses. We illustrate this by deriving transmissibility estimates for the H3N2v-M virus, an important step in evaluating the possible pandemic threat posed by this virus.

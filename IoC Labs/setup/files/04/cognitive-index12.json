The objectives of this study were to investigate the utility of the temporal scan statistic for detecting MRSA clusters, validate clusters using molecular techniques and hospital records, and determine significant differences in the rate of MRSA cases using regression models. METHODS: Patients admitted to a community hospital between August 2006 and February 2011, and identified with MRSA \u003E 48 hours following hospital admission, were included in this study. Between March 2010 and February 2011, MRSA specimens were obtained for spa typing. MRSA clusters were investigated using a retrospective temporal scan statistic. Tests were conducted on a monthly scale and significant clusters were compared to MRSA outbreaks identified by hospital personnel. Associations between the rate of MRSA cases and the variables year, month, and season were investigated using a negative binomial regression model. RESULTS: During the study period, 735 MRSA cases were identified and 167 MRSA isolates were spa typed. Nine different spa types were identified with spa type 2/t002 (88.6%) the most prevalent. The temporal scan statistic identified significant MRSA clusters at the hospital (n = 2), service (n = 16), and ward (n = 10) levels (P \u2264 0.05). Seven clusters were concordant with nine MRSA outbreaks identified by hospital staff. For the remaining clusters, seven events may have been equivalent to true outbreaks and six clusters demonstrated possible transmission events. The regression analysis indicated years 2009\u20132011, compared to 2006, and months March and April, compared to January, were associated with an increase in the rate of MRSA cases (P \u2264 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of the temporal scan statistic identified several MRSA clusters that were not detected by hospital personnel. The identification of specific years and months with increased MRSA rates may be attributable to several hospital level factors including the presence of other pathogens. Within hospitals, the incorporation of the temporal scan statistic to standard surveillance techniques is a valuable tool for healthcare workers to evaluate surveillance strategies and aid in the identification of MRSA clusters.","publish_time":"2014-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Faires, Meredith C; Pearl, David L; Ciccotelli, William A; Berke, Olaf; Reid-Smith, Richard J; Weese, J Scott","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85e67a0122ea002985fd0e498a7f94df64957701.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4097048.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25005247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MRSA outbreaks","significant MRSA clusters","identification of MRSA clusters","MRSA isolates","MRSA specimens","rate of MRSA cases","significant clusters","increased MRSA rates","remaining clusters","hospital personnel","hospital records","hospital admission","community hospital","hospital staff","retrospective temporal scan statistic","hospital level factors","true outbreaks","conventional surveillance techniques","standard surveillance techniques","molecular techniques","surveillance strategies","significant differences","different spa types","regression models","months","regression analysis","study period","identification of specific years","healthcare workers","healthcare facilities","negative binomial regression model","rule-based guidelines","possible transmission events","resistant Staphylococcus aureus","valuable tool","over-reporting of methicillin","aid","variables year","season","presence","monthly scale","application","incorporation","utility","BACKGROUND","levels","Patients","ward","hours","Associations","METHODS","Tests","pathogens","RESULTS","t002","CONCLUSIONS","hospitals","service","objectives"],"language":"en"},

This vectored vaccine candidate is attenuated in mice, where a single immunization induces ZIKV-specific antibody and T cell immune responses that provide protection against ZIKV challenge. Co-expression of prM, E, and NS1 induces significantly higher levels of Th2 and Th17 cytokine responses than prM-E. In addition, NS1 alone is capable of conferring partial protection against ZIKV infection in mice even though it does not induce neutralizing antibodies.

METHODS We enrolled 35 confirmed index cases and their 148 household contacts, January 2020-February 2020, in Zhuhai, China. All participants were interviewed and asked to complete questionnaires. Household contacts were then prospectively followed active symptom monitoring through the 21-day period and nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected at 3-7 days intervals. Epidemiological, demographic and clinical data (when available) were collected. RESULTS Assuming that all these secondary cases were infected by their index cases, the second infection rate (SIR) in household context is 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.4%-44.4%), with 10.4% of secondary cases being asymptomatic. Multivariate analysis showed that household contacts with underlying medical conditions, a history of direct exposure to Wuhan and its surrounding areas, and shared vehicle with an index patient were associated with higher susceptibility. Household members without protective measures after illness onset of the index patient seem to increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median incubation period and serial interval within household were estimated to be 4.3 days (95% CI; 3.4 to 5.3 days) and 5.1 days (95% CI; 4.3 to 6.2 days), respectively.

However, challenges remain and persisting inequities in vaccine uptake contribute to the continued occurrence and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Inequalities in immunization coverage by geography, urban-rural, and socio-economic status jeopardize the achievement of global immunization goals and call for renewed immunization strategies. These should take into account emerging opportunities for building better immunization systems and services, as well as the development of new vaccine products and delivery technologies. Such strategies need to achieve equity in vaccination coverage across and within countries. This will require the participation of communities, a better understanding of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, the expansion of vaccination across the life course, approaches to improve immunization in middle-income countries, enhanced use of data and possible financial and non-financial incentives. Vaccines also have an important role to play in comprehensive disease control, including the fight against antimicrobial resistance.

However, little is documented for many emerging opportunistic pathogens and their biological characteristics. Here, we isolated a strain of extended-spectrum \u03B2-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae from a patient with a biliary tract infection. We explored the biological and genomic characteristics of this strain to provide new evidence and detailed information for opportunistic pathogens about the co-infection they may cause. RESULTS: The isolate grew very slowly but conferred strong protection for the co-infected cephalosporin-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae. As the initial laboratory testing failed to identify the taxonomy of the strain, great perplexity was caused in the etiological diagnosis and anti-infection treatment for the patient. Rigorous sequencing efforts achieved the complete genome sequence of the isolate which we designated as AF18. AF18 is phylogenetically close to a few strains isolated from soil, clinical sewage, and patients, forming a novel species together, while the taxonomic nomenclature of which is still under discussion. And this is the first report of human infection of this novel species. Like its relatives, AF18 harbors many genes related to cell mobility, various genes adaptive to both the natural environment and animal host, over 30 mobile genetic elements, and a plasmid bearing bla(CTX-M-3) gene, indicating its ability to disseminate antimicrobial-resistant genes from the natural environment to patients. Transcriptome sequencing identified two sRNAs that critically regulate the growth rate of AF18, which could serve as targets for novel antimicrobial strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings imply that AF18 and its species are not only infection-relevant but also potential disseminators of antibiotic resistance genes, which highlights the need for continuous monitoring for this novel species and efforts to develop treatment strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Zhao; Li, Daixi; Shi, Xing; Zhai, Yao; Guo, Yatao; Zheng, Yali; Zhao, Lili; He, Yukun; Chen, Yusheng; Wang, Zhanwei; Su, Jianrong; Kang, Yu; Gao, Zhancheng","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22b7dc4a81f482a66e1272bc9fb6b58a2979907c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156906.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293254/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-6720-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Klebsiella"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel species","co-infection","infection-relevant","antimicrobial-resistant genes","anti-infection treatment","novel antimicrobial strategies","emerging opportunistic pathogens","biliary tract infection","report of human infection","growth rate of AF18","various genes adaptive","natural environment","strain of extended","patients","biological characteristics","treatment strategies","isolate","potential disseminators of antibiotic resistance genes","Rigorous sequencing efforts","antibiotic-resistant infections","clinical practice","clinical sewage","genomic characteristics","Transcriptome sequencing","co-infected cephalosporin-sensitive Klebsiella pneumoniae","new evidence","detailed information","complete genome sequence","animal host","etiological diagnosis","cell mobility","plasmid","mobile genetic elements","Enterobacteriaceae","spectrum \u03B2-lactamase","taxonomy","soil","strains","need","great perplexity","strong protection","continuous monitoring","sRNAs","ability","targets","CTX","bla","taxonomic nomenclature","BACKGROUND","findings","initial laboratory testing","CONCLUSIONS","relatives","discussion","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

These facts suggest an evasion of the immune system by virulent TGEV. In this study, we showed that a virulent TGEV SHXB strain could infect porcine immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs), and down-regulate cell surface markers (SLA-II-DR, CD1a and CD80/86). Moreover, SHXB-infected immature Mo-DCs showed low expression of IL-12 and IFN-\u03B3, and also lost the ability to stimulate T cell proliferation. Finally, SHXB inhibited the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03BAB) in these cells. Instead, UV-inactivated SHXB (UV-SHXB) had the opposite effects in immature Mo-DCs. In conclusion, the virulent SHXB could severely impair immature Mo-DCs, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of virulent TGEV in vivo.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Shanshan; Gao, Qi; Lin, Jian; Yan, Mengfei; Yu, Qinghua; Yang, Qian","journal":"Research in Veterinary Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/703b0f937e3db3975e15b0f0afc230955e35ddac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111762.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0034528814002458; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528814002458; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2014.09.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25307113/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virulent SHXB","virulent TGEV SHXB strain","UV-SHXB","SHXB-infected immature Mo-DCs","pathogenesis of virulent TGEV","UV-inactivated SHXB","TGEV carriers","virulent transmissible gastroenteritis virus","porcine immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells","cell surface markers","T cell proliferation","activation of nuclear factor kappa B","weeks of age","low expression of IL","NF-\u03BAB","opposite effects","SLA","rise","immune system","ability","infection","evasion","CD1a","Abstract Exposure of piglets","IFN-\u03B3","mortality","adult pigs","CD80","facts","conclusion","study"],"language":"en"},

The 2-5As bind and activate the RNase L, an endoRNase degrading viral and cellular RNA leading to inhibition of viral replication. The 2-5A system is tightly controlled by synthesis and degradation of 2-5As. Whereas synthesis is mediated by the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase family of enzymes, degradation seems to be orchestrated by multiple enzyme nucleases including phosphodiesterase 12, the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 and the A-kinase anchoring protein 7. RESULTS: Here we present assay tools for identification and characterization of the enzymes regulating cellular 2-5A levels. A procedure is described for the production of 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates, which are then used as substrates for development and demonstration of enzyme assays measuring synthetase and nuclease activities, respectively. The synthetase assays produce only a single reaction product allowing for very precise kinetic assessment of the enzymes. We present an assay using dATP and the A(pA)(3) tetramer core as substrates, which requires prior isolation of A(pA)(3). A synthetase assay using either of the dNTPs individually together with NAD(\u002B) as substrates is also presented. The nuclease reactions make use of the isolated 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates in producing a mixture of shorter reaction products, which are resolved by ion-exchange chromatography to determine the enzyme activities. A purified human 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase and a purified human phosphodiesterase 12 along with crude extracts expressing those proteins, are used to demonstrate the assays. CONCLUSIONS: This paper comprises an assay toolbox for identification and characterization of the synthetases and nucleases regulating cellular 2-5A levels. Assays are presented for both enzyme families. The assays can also be used to address a broader cellular role of the OAS enzymes, based on the multiple substrate specificity intrinsic to these proteins.

The first is work inspired by the Reproductive Justice Movement, that points to the intersectional axes of inequality that shape abortion discourse and position us in relation to reproductive choice and access issues. The second is work that examines the particularity of the constitution of the aborting body, reflecting the particularity of the pregnant body. This is a specific body, with a specific history; abortion discourse draws from and makes a significant contribution to the meaning and lived experience of this body. The third area of scholarship we highlight is that which seeks to amplify the meaning of abortion as a social good. Much abortion scholarship is attuned to a critique of negative aspects of abortion\u2014from its representation in popular culture to restrictive law and access issues.

We examined the hypothesis that bacteria and viruses may modulate this heterogeneity and that interactions between bacterial and viral infection may affect changes in airway bacterial load and the clinical features and inflammatory responses of exacerbations in patients with COPD. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Outpatient Department, London Chest Hospital, London, UK. Patients Thirty-nine patients with COPD. Measurements We prospectively studied 56 COPD exacerbations, obtaining clinical data and paired sputum and serum samples at baseline and exacerbation. Qualitative and quantitative microbiology, polymerase chain reaction detection for rhinovirus, and estimation of cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed. Results A total of 69.6% of exacerbations were associated with a bacterial pathogen, most commonly Haemophilus influenzae. Rhinovirus was identified in 19.6% of exacerbations. The rise in bacterial load at exacerbation correlated with the rise in sputum interleukin (IL)-8 (r = 0.37, p = 0.022) and fall in FEV1 (r = 0.35, p = 0.048). Exacerbations with both rhinovirus and H influenzae had higher bacterial loads (108.56 cfu/mL vs 108.05cfu/mL, p = 0.018) and serum IL-6 (13.75 pg/mL vs 6.29 pg/mL, p = 0.028) than exacerbations without both pathogens. In exacerbations with both cold symptoms (a marker of putative viral infection) and a bacterial pathogen, the FEV1 fall was greater (20.3% vs 3.6%, p = 0.026) and symptom count was higher (p = 0.019) than those with a bacterial pathogen alone. Conclusions The clinical severity and inflammatory responses in COPD exacerbations are modulated by the nature of the infecting organism: bacterial and viral pathogens interact to cause additional rises in inflammatory markers and greater exacerbation severity.","publish_time":"2006-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilkinson, Tom M.A.; Hurst, John R.; Perera, Wayomi R.; Wilks, Mark; Donaldson, Gavin C.; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/193a1994c7ee82fcbfeb42c07e820bfd5e13d78e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094441.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215387523; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215387523","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial pathogen","inflammatory responses of exacerbations","clinical severity of COPD exacerbations","airway bacterial load","higher bacterial loads","rhinovirus","vs","patients","greater exacerbation severity","clinical data","clinical features","inflammatory markers","viral pathogens","serum IL","cfu","pg","FEV1 fall","marker of putative viral infection","paired sputum","serum samples","H influenzae","sputum interleukin","Haemophilus influenzae","Study objectives","London Chest Hospital","Design Prospective cohort study","polymerase chain reaction detection","estimation of cytokine levels","additional rises","quantitative microbiology","changes","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","baseline","infecting organism","nature","Outpatient Department","cold symptoms","heterogeneity","interactions","symptom count","Conclusions","viruses","hypothesis","determinants","Measurements","factors","total"],"language":"en"},

The balance between oxidants and antioxidants is necessary for the normal homeostasis of cells and organisms. Experimental works demonstrate the role of oxidative stress that is caused by influenza virus as well as the toxic effects of some antiviral drugs. Therefore, antiviral drugs should be characterized by its pro- and antioxidant activity, because it can affect its therapeutic efficiency. The aim of the study was to quantify the antioxidant capacity and propose the mechanism of the antioxidant effect of the antiviral drug Umifenovir (Arbidol(\u00AE)). The kinetic chemiluminescence with the 2,2\u2019-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride \u002B luminol system was used to quantify the antioxidant capacity of Umifenovir relative to the standard compound Trolox. With computer simulation, the reaction scheme and rate constants were proposed. The antioxidant capacity of 0.9 \u03BCM Umifenovir (maximum concentration of Umifenovir in blood after oral administration of 200 mg) was as high as 1.65 \u00B1 0.18 \u03BCM of Trolox. Thus, the total antioxidant capacity of Umifenovir is comparable to the antioxidant capacity of Trolox. Unlike Trolox, Umifenovir reacts with free radicals in two stages. For Trolox, the free radical scavenging rate constant was k = 2000 nM(\u22121) min.(\u22121), for Umifenovir k(1) = 300 nM(\u22121)min.(\u22121), k(2) = 4 nM(\u22121)min.(\u22121).

This article summarizes the principal invited lectures. Phillip Furman, the Elion award recipient, described the research leading to sofosbuvir. Dennis Liotta, who received the Hol\u00FD award, described how an investigation into HIV entry inhibitors led to a new therapy for cancer patients. Erica Ollmann Saphire, winner of the Prusoff Young Investigator award, explored the world of viral proteins and how they remodel to perform different essential roles in viral replication. The keynote addresses, by Raffaele De Francesco and Michael Manns, reported on the remarkable progress made in the therapy of chronic HCV infections. A third keynote address, by Armand Sprecher, related the difficulties and successes of M\u00E9dicins Sans Fronti\u00E8res in West Africa ravaged by the Ebola outbreak. There were three mini-symposia on RNA Viruses, Antiviral Chemistry and Emerging Viruses. There was a good collection of talks on RNA viruses (norovirus, rabies, dengue, HEV, HCV, and RSV). A highlight of the chemistry was the preparation of prodrugs for nucleotide triphosphates as this opens a door to new options. The third mini-symposium emphasized how research work in the antiviral area is continuing to expand and needs to do so with a sense of urgency. Although this meeting report covers only a few of the presentations, it aims to illustrate the great diversity of topics discussed at ICAR, bringing together knowledge and expertise from the whole spectrum of antiviral research.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vere Hodge, R.

With other infections such as tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox, the concept of aerosol transmission is so well accepted that isolation of such patients is the norm. With current concerns about a possible approaching influenza pandemic, the control of transmission via infectious air has become more important. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe the factors involved in: (1) the generation of an infectious aerosol, (2) the transmission of infectious droplets or droplet nuclei from this aerosol, and (3) the potential for inhalation of such droplets or droplet nuclei by a susceptible host. On this basis, recommendations are made to improve the control of aerosol-transmitted infections in hospitals as well as in the design and construction of future isolation facilities.","publish_time":"2006-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, J.

To overcome this, we evaluated the quantitative effect of homogenisation, centrifugation, filtration, chloroform treatment and random amplification on a mock-virome (containing nine highly diverse viruses) and a bacterial mock-community (containing four faecal bacterial species) using quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing. This resulted in an optimised protocol that was able to recover all viruses present in the mock-virome and strongly alters the ratio of viral versus bacterial and 16S rRNA genetic material in favour of viruses (from 43.2% to 96.7% viral reads and from 47.6% to 0.19% bacterial reads). Furthermore, our study indicated that most of the currently used virome protocols, using small filter pores and/or stringent centrifugation conditions may have largely overlooked large viruses present in viromes. We propose NetoVIR (Novel enrichment technique of VIRomes), which allows for a fast, reproducible and high throughput sample preparation for viral metagenomics studies, introducing minimal bias. This procedure is optimised mainly for faecal samples, but with appropriate concentration steps can also be used for other sample types with lower initial viral loads.","publish_time":"2015-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Concei\u00E7\u00E3o-Neto, N\u00E1dia; Zeller, Mark; Lefr\u00E8re, Hanne; De Bruyn, Pieter; Beller, Leen; Deboutte, Ward; Yinda, Claude Kwe; Lavigne, Rob; Maes, Piet; Ranst, Marc Van; Heylen, Elisabeth; Matthijnssens, Jelle","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0ad5a9116068caa5f78a95f8141a2a811662793.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4642273.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep16532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26559140/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mock-virome","viral reads","bacterial reads","used virome protocols","bacterial mock-community","high throughput virome analysis","ratio of viral","favour of viruses","large viruses","diverse viruses","human gut virome","faecal bacterial species","viral metagenomics studies","high throughput sample preparation","lower initial viral loads","sample types","faecal samples","quantitative PCR","optimised protocol","stringent centrifugation conditions","quantitative effect of homogenisation","Novel enrichment technique of VIRomes","filtration","disease","small filter pores","S rRNA genetic material","chloroform treatment","lack of validated methods","random amplification","role","health","NetoVIR","minimal bias","appropriate concentration steps","generation sequencing","major limitation","procedure","study"],"language":"en"},

The 4382- and 7073 amino acid residue SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins are predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases (bringing the total number of SARS-CoV proteins to 28). A phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene, using a distantly related torovirus as an outgroup, demonstrated that, despite a number of unique features, SARS-CoV is most closely related to group 2 coronaviruses. Distant homologs of cellular RNA processing enzymes were identified in group 2 coronaviruses, with four of them being conserved in SARS-CoV. These newly recognized viral enzymes place the mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis in a completely new perspective.

Particularly significant are its achievements in population genetics as a result of the development of coalescent theory, which have contributed to more accurate model-based parameter estimation and explicit hypothesis testing. The study of the evolution of many microorganisms, and HIV in particular, have benefited from these new methodologies. HIV is well suited for such sophisticated population analyses because of its large population sizes, short generation times, high substitution rates and relatively small genomes. All these factors make HIV an ideal and fascinating model to study molecular evolution in real time. Here we review the significant advances made in HIV evolution through the application of phylogenetic approaches. We first examine the relative roles of mutation and recombination on the molecular evolution of HIV and its adaptive response to drug therapy and tissue allocation. We then review some of the fundamental questions in HIV evolution in relation to its origin and diversification and describe some of the insights gained using phylogenies. Finally, we show how phylogenetic analysis has advanced our knowledge of HIV dynamics (i.e., phylodynamics).","publish_time":"2012-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Castro-Nallar, Eduardo; P\u00E9rez-Losada, Marcos; Burton, Gregory F.; Crandall, Keith A.","journal":"Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59bf0d7138b4f41dc29fd6c62c3f3b87f2b3f57c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3258026.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1055790311004908; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790311004908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22138161/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2011.11.019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HIV evolution","molecular evolution of HIV","knowledge of HIV dynamics","study","molecular biology","population genetics","Abstract Molecular phylogenetics","large population sizes","sophisticated population analyses","fascinating model","phylogenetic analysis","significant advances","application of phylogenetic approaches","accurate model-based parameter estimation","short generation times","high substitution rates","adaptive response","bioinformatics","result","microbiology","ecology","relation","recombination","drug therapy","explicit hypothesis testing","genomics","epidemiology","tissue allocation","small genomes","disparate fields","achievements","origin","fundamental questions","microorganisms","relative roles of mutation","development of coalescent theory","real time","diversification","biochemistry","factors","insights","phylodynamics","new methodologies","phylogenies"],"language":"en"},

It also includes \u201Cadvice sheets\u201D giving practical guidance on what to do when there is a risk of infection transmission in the home.","publish_time":"2007-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bloomfield, Sally F.; Cookson, Barry; Falkiner, Fred; Griffith, Chris; Cleary, Vivien","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b3393857f45e6ff848e379002960c9b957de14c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135013.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S019665530601193X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019665530601193X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs2NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["community viewpoint","risk of infection transmission","Home Hygiene","clostridium difficile strains","antibiotic resistant strains","ESBL","MRSA","extent","report","Escherichia coli","mode of transmission","practical guidance","health care-associated methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus","International Scientific Forum","Extended-spectrum \u03B2-lactamase","people","hospital patients","species","advice sheets","situations","organisms","support","order","responsibility","potential","prevalence","concern","response"],"language":"en"},

In the span of less than a year, the lethal strain of bird flu is spreading very fast across the globe mainly in South East Asia, parts of Central Asia, Africa and Europe. In order to study the patterns of spread of epidemic, we made an investigation of outbreaks of the epidemic in one week, that is from February 13\u201318, 2006, when the deadly virus surfaced in India. We have designed a statistical transmission model of bird flu taking into account the factors that affect the epidemic transmission such as source of infection, social and natural factors and various control measures are suggested. For modeling the general intensity coefficient f ( r ) , we have implemented the recent ideas given in the article Fitting the Bill, Nature [R. Howlett, Fitting the bill, Nature 439 (2006) 402], which describes the geographical spread of epidemics due to transportation of poultry products. Our aim is to study the spread of avian influenza, both in time and space, to gain a better understanding of transmission mechanism. Our model yields satisfactory results as evidenced by the simulations and may be used for the prediction of future situations of epidemic for longer periods. We utilize real data at these various scales and our model allows one to generalize our predictions and make better suggestions for the control of this epidemic.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Upadhyay, Ranjit Kumar; Kumari, Nitu; Rao, V.

This article examines the dimensions and roots of this phenomenon. It identifies seven types of views, attitudes, or tendencies that can be described as denial, dissent, disagreements, or doubts. Three major factors underlying the AIDS denial are discussed. These are (1) historical impressions that STDs are Western diseases, (2) desire of some Asian leaders to forge Eastern points of view, and (3) long-held negative image towards the peoples or groups who happened to be at the front-line of the population groups exposed to the epidemic. The third factor is the most important source of denial. AIDS denial is not a new and isolated phenomenon but the one shaped by the global and historical institutions.

Methods Focus groups were conducted at the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc, (APIC) 2009 conference to evaluate IPs\u0027 experience with the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic and assess their perceived needs related to novel H1N1 topics and products required for future education and reference materials. Results Forty IPs (37 from the United States and 3 international) participated in the focus groups. Needed reference materials identified by attendees included infection prevention guidance for nonacute care settings; occupational health polices; and brief, multilanguage patient/family educational materials. Educational topics on which IPs need to be trained include isolation precautions/personal protective equipment recommendations for novel H1N1 patients, coordination between hospitals and community response agencies, and surge management. The rapidly changing and conflicting recommendations related to patient management made responding to this event challenging. IPs require synthesized infection prevention guidelines developed in a concise, real-time format.

These characteristics make HFOV conceptually attractive as an ideal lung-protective ventilatory mode for the management of ARDS, as the high mPaws prevent cyclical derecruitment of the lung and the small Vts limit alveolar overdistension. In this review, we will summarize the literature describing the use of HFOV in adult patients with ARDS. In addition, we will discuss recent experimental studies of HFOV that have advanced our understanding of its mechanical properties. We identified 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 12 case series evaluating HFOV in adults with ARDS. In these studies, HFOV appears to be safe and consistently improves oxygenation when used as a rescue mode of ventilation in patients with severe ARDS. The two RCTs comparing HFOV to conventional ventilation revealed encouraging results but failed to show a mortality benefit of HFOV over conventional ventilation. Further research is needed to identify optimal patient selection, technique, the actual Vt delivered, and the role of combining HFOV with other interventions, such as recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and nitric oxide.","publish_time":"2007-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Kenneth P.W.; Stewart, Thomas E.; Mehta, Sangeeta","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/38e90ac6ed74a02c089a7b6445a966c59851f5a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126113.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215375309; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215375309","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFOV","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of HFOV","mortality benefit of HFOV","recent experimental studies of HFOV","conventional ventilation","high mPaws","management of ARDS","severe ARDS","rescue mode of ventilation","High-frequency oscillatory ventilation","RCTs","adult patients","ideal lung-protective ventilatory mode","application of high mean airway pressures","small Vts limit alveolar overdistension","rapid delivery of small tidal volumes","gas","prone positioning","technique","case series","optimal patient selection","recruitment maneuvers","actual Vt","cyclical derecruitment","encouraging results","interventions","role","adults","nitric oxide","randomized controlled trials","oxygenation","understanding","literature","mechanical properties","research","addition","characteristics","review"],"language":"en"},

Although the epidemic was eventually controlled through the implementation of strict quarantine measures, there continues a need to investigate the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and develop interventions should it re-emerge. Numerous studies have shown that neutralizing antibodies against the virus can be found in patients infected with SARS-CoV within days upon the onset of illness and lasting up to several months. In contrast, there is little data on the kinetics of T cell responses during SARS-CoV infection and little is known about their role in the recovery process. However, recent studies in mice suggest the importance of T cells in viral clearance during SARS-CoV infection. Moreover, a growing number of studies have investigated the memory T cell responses in recovered SARS patients. This review covers the available literature on the emerging importance of T cell responses in SARS-CoV infection, particularly on the mapping of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, longevity, polyfunctionality and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association as well as their potential implications on treatment and vaccine development.","publish_time":"2012-09-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Janice Oh, Hsueh-Ling; Ken-En Gan, Samuel; Bertoletti, Antonio; Tan, Yee-Joo","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fa8abac6ce337d7597f4c0d4adac979c4e0b9b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3636424.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038429/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2012.26","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","SARS coronavirus","recovered SARS patients","memory T cell responses","kinetics of T cell responses","emerging importance of T cell responses","importance of T cells","mapping of cytotoxic T lymphocyte","Numerous studies","recent studies","epidemic","growing number of studies","little data","polyfunctionality","longevity","epitopes","CTL","viral clearance","human leukocyte antigen","association","potential implications","HLA","mice","severe acute respiratory syndrome","available literature","treatment","vaccine development","neutralizing antibodies","need","days","implementation of strict quarantine measures","onset of illness","continents","mortality rate","role","recovery process","review","contrast","interventions","months"],"language":"en"},

We detected influenza D virus in 8.7% of cases, often as the sole viral agent and always in conjunction with bacterial co\u2010infection with one or more agents. Viral RNA was present in both the upper and lower respiratory tract and pathological changes in lung tissues were observed alongside signs of concurrent bacterial infections. Sequencing of one UK isolate revealed that it is similar to viruses from the Republic of Ireland and Italy.","publish_time":"2019-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dane, Hannah; Duffy, Catherine; Guelbenzu, Maria; Hause, Ben; Fee, Sean; Forster, Fiona; McMenamy, Michael J.; Lemon, Ken","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a69bbf98f24e5bf8b02654e8b5d498367432b0dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168542.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228318/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY2LmNzdjs5Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1682230,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EO741A\u002B8i3fXRJgmuSS7gQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_66.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza D","UK"],"locations":["North America","United States","Europe","Asia"],"keyphrases":["influenza D virus","respiratory disease signs","described virus of cattle","Viral RNA","UK","development of bovine respiratory disease","lower respiratory tract","bacterial co\u2010infection","main viral reservoir","sole viral agent","molecular testing of cattle","signs of concurrent bacterial infections","post\u2010mortem examination","pathological changes","mounting evidence","lung tissues","conjunction","small ruminants","pigs","cases","Republic of Ireland","United States","viruses","Europe","Asia","North America","spring","Italy","agents","date","winter","Sequencing"],"language":"en"},

We sampled feces and/or anal swabs of 1,044 insectivorous bats of 2 families and 17 species from 21 different locations within Colorado from 2007 to 2009. We detected alphacoronavirus RNA in bats of 4 species: big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), 10% prevalence; long-legged bats (Myotis volans), 8% prevalence; little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), 3% prevalence; and western long-eared bats (Myotis evotis), 2% prevalence. Overall, juvenile bats were twice as likely to be positive for CoV RNA as adult bats. At two of the rural sampling sites, CoV RNAs were detected in big brown and long-legged bats during the three sequential summers of this study. CoV RNA was detected in big brown bats in all five of the urban maternity roosts sampled throughout each of the periods tested. Individually tagged big brown bats that were positive for CoV RNA and later sampled again all became CoV RNA negative. Nucleotide sequences in the RdRp gene fell into 3 main clusters, all distinct from those of Old World bats. Similar nucleotide sequences were found in amplicons from gene 1b and the spike gene in both a big-brown and a long-legged bat, indicating that a CoV may be capable of infecting bats of different genera. These data suggest that ongoing evolution of CoVs in bats creates the possibility of a continued threat for emergence into hosts of other species. Alphacoronavirus RNA was detected at a high prevalence in big brown bats in roosts in close proximity to human habitations (10%) and known to have direct contact with people (19%), suggesting that significant potential opportunities exist for cross-species transmission of these viruses.

A previous study suggested that PRRSV nsp4, a 3C-like protease, antagonizes interferon beta (IFN-\u03B2) production by cleaving the NF-\u03BAB essential modulator (NEMO) at a single site, glutamate 349 (E349). Here, we demonstrated that EAV nsp4 also inhibited virus-induced IFN-\u03B2 production by targeting NEMO for proteolytic cleavage and that the scission occurred at four sites: E166, E171, glutamine 205 (Q205), and E349. Additionally, we found that, besides the previously reported cleavage site E349 in NEMO, scission by PRRSV nsp4 took place at two additional sites, E166 and E171. These results imply that while cleaving NEMO is a common strategy utilized by EAV and PRRSV nsp4 to antagonize IFN induction, EAV nsp4 adopts a more complex substrate recognition mechanism to target NEMO. By analyzing the abilities of the eight different NEMO fragments resulting from EAV or PRRSV nsp4 scission to induce IFN-\u03B2 production, we serendipitously found that a NEMO fragment (residues 1 to 349) could activate IFN-\u03B2 transcription more robustly than full-length NEMO, whereas all other NEMO cleavage products were abrogated for the IFN-\u03B2-inducing capacity. Thus, NEMO cleavage at E349 alone may not be sufficient to completely inactivate the IFN response via this signaling adaptor. Altogether, our findings suggest that EAV and PRRSV nsp4 cleave NEMO at multiple sites and that this strategy is critical for disarming the innate immune response for viral survival. IMPORTANCE The arterivirus nsp4-encoded 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) plays an important role in virus replication and immune evasion, making it an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics. Previous work suggested that PRRSV nsp4 suppresses type I IFN production by cleaving NEMO at a single site. In contrast, the present study demonstrates that both EAV and PRRSV nsp4 cleave NEMO at multiple sites and that this strategy is essential for disruption of type I IFN production. Moreover, we reveal that EAV nsp4 also cleaves NEMO at glutamine 205 (Q205), which is not targeted by PRRSV nsp4. Notably, targeting a glutamine in NEMO for cleavage has been observed only with picornavirus 3C proteases (3C(pro)) and coronavirus 3CL(pro). In aggregate, our work expands knowledge of the innate immune evasion mechanisms associated with NEMO cleavage by arterivirus nsp4 and describes a novel substrate recognition characteristic of EAV nsp4.","publish_time":"2019-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jiyao; Wang, Dang; Sun, Zheng; Gao, Li; Zhu, Xinyu; Guo, Jiahui; Xu, Shangen; Fang, Liurong; Li, Kui; Xiao, Shaobo","journal":"Journal of Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db69147a86435a1d729a28b25d7df41d8be97c42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6613749.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00385-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944180/; https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/12/e00385-19.full.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EAV","PRRSV","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cleaving NEMO","PRRSV nsp4 scission","full-length NEMO","arterivirus nsp4","NEMO cleavage products","IFN production","different NEMO fragments","IFN response","IFN induction","IFN-\u03B2 transcription","novel substrate recognition characteristic of EAV nsp4","virus-induced IFN-\u03B2 production","proteolytic cleavage","reported cleavage site E349","multiple sites","glutamine","virus replication","additional sites","single site","C proteases","innate immune response","innate immune evasion mechanisms","respiratory syndrome virus","Equine arteritis virus","common strategy","E166","E171","Previous work","previous study","Q205","complex substrate recognition mechanism","disruption of type","present study","attractive target","NF-\u03BAB essential modulator","knowledge","place","important role","horse","interferon beta","major threats","family Arteriviridae","viral survival","members","picornavirus","swine-breeding industries","antiviral therapeutics","abilities","glutamate","coronavirus","findings","contrast","aggregate","residues","adaptor","IMPORTANCE","capacity","results"],"language":"en"},

Mean age was 51.4 years, and mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score was 5.35. Coronavirus serology was positive in 95% (19 of 20 patients). NIPPV was started 9.6 days (mean) from symptom onset, and mean duration of NIPPV usage was 84.3 h. Endotracheal intubation was avoided in 14 patients (70%), in whom the length of ICU stay was shorter (3.1 days vs 21.3 days, p \u003C 0.001) and the chest radiography score within 24 h of NIPPV was lower (15.1 vs 22.5, p = 0.005) compared to intubated patients. Intubation avoidance was predicted by a marked reduction in respiratory rate (9.2 breaths/min) and supplemental oxygen requirement (3.1 L/min) within 24 h of NIPPV. Complications were few and reversible. There were no infections among the 105 health-care workers caring for the patients receiving NIPPV. Conclusions: NIPPV was effective in the treatment of ARF in the patients with SARS studied, and its use was safe for health-care workers.","publish_time":"2004-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheung, Thomas M.T.; Yam, Loretta Y.C.; So, Loletta K.Y.; Lau, Arthur C.W.; Poon, Edwin; Kong, Bernard M.H.; Yung, Raymond W.H.","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0dea096a4f73085b277b6977c8c3367b2957a6e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094489.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215312289; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215312289","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY1LmNzdjszODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1657080,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"OI8EKoIlZ3w9lnR7B8CWOw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_65.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["h.

The single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12252-C, which is rare in Caucasian populations, but much more common in the Han Chinese population, has been found in much higher homozygous frequency in patients with severe acute influenza. Until now, there has been no study on the effect of this genetic variant on the clinical control of other viral infections. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of IFITM3-rs12252 genotypes on primary HIV-1 infection progression in an acute HIV-1-infected cohort in Beijing (PRIMO), China. DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified IFITM3-rs12252 genotypes of 178 acute HIV-1-infected patients and 196 HIV-negative candidates from the PRIMO cohort. HIV-1 viral load and CD4(\u002B) T-cell counts were monitored at multiple time points during the first year of infection, and the association between IFITM3-rs12252 genotype and disease progression was evaluated. RESULTS: The current study shows that the IFITM3-rs12252 genetic variant affects the progression of HIV-1 infection, but not the acquisition. A significantly higher frequency of the CC/CT genotypes was found in rapid progressors compared to nonprogressors. Patients with CC/CT genotypes showed an elevated peak viremia level and significantly lower CD4(\u002B) T-cell count at multiple time points during the first year of primary infection, and a significantly higher risk of rapid decline of the CD4(\u002B) T-cell count to below 350 cells/\u03BCl. CONCLUSION: A novel association between IFITM3 gene polymorphism and rapid disease progression is reported in an acute HIV-1-infected MSM cohort in China.","publish_time":"2015-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yonghong; Makvandi-Nejad, Shokouh; Qin, Ling; Zhao, Yan; Zhang, Tong; Wang, Lili; Repapi, Emmanouela; Taylor, Stephen; McMichael, Andrew; Li, Ning; Dong, Tao; Wu, Hao","journal":"AIDS","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d132c2b351eee236fe4f5c1c06bf90bd75ade661.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4442129.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25784441/; https://doi.org/10.1097/qad.0000000000000632","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CC/CT","MSM"],"locations":["Beijing","China"],"keyphrases":["acute HIV","progression of HIV","IFITM3-rs12252 genotypes","primary HIV","infection progression","IFITM3-rs12252 genetic variant","impact of IFITM3","IFITM3 gene polymorphism","CT genotypes","infected patients","rapid disease progression","HIV-negative candidates","infected cohort","year of infection","year of primary infection","higher frequency","PRIMO cohort","multiple time points","severe acute influenza","T-cell counts","infected MSM cohort","lower CD4","single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12252-C","rapid progressors","higher homozygous frequency","higher risk of rapid decline","CC","China","multiple pathogenic viruses","novel association","influenza virus","viral load","viral infections","current study","interferon-inducible transmembrane protein","elevated peak viremia level","clinical control","Beijing","Caucasian populations","Han Chinese population","BACKGROUND","cells","effect","CONCLUSION","METHODS","RESULTS","\u03BCl","nonprogressors","DESIGN","OBJECTIVES","acquisition"],"language":"en"},

Parainfluenza virus (PIV) is a common cause of acute respiratory tract infections, but little is known about PIV infection in children and adults in Africa, especially in settings where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence is high. Methods. We conducted active, prospective sentinel surveillance for children and adults hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) from 2009 to 2014 in South Africa. We enrolled controls (outpatients without febrile or respiratory illness) to calculate the attributable fraction for PIV infection. Respiratory specimens were tested by multiplex real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay for parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3. Results. Of 18 282 SARI cases enrolled, 1188 (6.5%) tested positive for any PIV type: 230 (19.4%) were type 1; 168 (14.1%) were type 2; 762 (64.1%) were type 3; and 28 (2.4%) had coinfection with 2 PIV types. After adjusting for age, HIV serostatus, and respiratory viral coinfection, the attributable fraction for PIV was 65.6% (95% CI [confidence interval], 47.1\u201377.7); PIV contributed to SARI among HIV-infected and -uninfected children \u003C5 years of age and among individuals infected with PIV types 1 and 3. The observed overall incidence of PIV-associated SARI was 38 (95% CI, 36\u201339) cases per 100 000 population and was highest in children \u003C1 year of age (925 [95% CI, 864\u2013989] cases per 100 000 population). Compared with persons without HIV, persons with HIV had an increased relative risk of PIV hospitalization (9.4; 95% CI, 8.5\u201310.3). Conclusions. Parainfluenza virus causes substantial severe respiratory disease in South Africa among children \u003C5 years of age, especially those that are infected with HIV.","publish_time":"2015-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cohen, Adam L.; Sahr, Philip K.; Treurnicht, Florette; Walaza, Sibongile; Groome, Michelle J.; Kahn, Kathleen; Dawood, Halima; Variava, Ebrahim; Tempia, Stefano; Pretorius, Marthi; Moyes, Jocelyn; Olorunju, Steven A.

Consumption of easily accessible modalities such as multivitamin (51.2%) and food products (32.1%) was most popular, and the majority of CAM users relied on mass media (52.4%) and the internet (27.4%) to obtain information on CAM. The use of CAM was associated with age between 40 and 49, age over 50, prior CAM use, and dissatisfaction with the government response to the MERS outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: CAM was commonly used by outpatients during the 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea, and mass media was the main source of information. Establishing a media platform is of paramount importance to provide reliable information and ensure the safety of its use.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hwang, Jung Hye; Cho, Hyun Jeong; Im, Hyea Bin; Jung, Young Sun; Choi, Soo Jeung; Han, Dongwoon","journal":"BMC Complement Med Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/08a76329625faa03777575af660b36e659dec428.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7220580.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-02945-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAM","MERS"],"locations":["South Korea","Middle East","Seoul"],"keyphrases":["use of CAM","characteristics of CAM use","prior CAM use","MERS outbreak","potential predictors of CAM use","types of CAM modalities","majority of CAM users","MERS infection","mass media","South Korea","community hospital","outpatients","media platform","age","reliable information","main source of information","health status","demographic characteristics","government response","accessible modalities","cross-sectional study","response rate","respondents\u2019 perceptions","largest event","logistic regression","concerns","paramount importance","alternative medicine","dissatisfaction","non-conventional solutions","data analysis","Seoul","questions","individuals","Chi-square test","Middle East","safety","epidemic","survey instrument","SPSS","METHODS","Consumption","BACKGROUND","food products","p-value","analyses","RESULTS","circumstances","CONCLUSIONS","internet"],"language":"en"},

To avoid investigation of artefacts in future ecoimmunological studies the influence of acute stress on the bacterial killing activity was assessed. Bats (Nyctalus noctula, n = 9) were repeatedly sampled in three time intervals up to 97 min after capture.

The profound transcriptional level of this effector of innate immunity was mapped within its unique cis-acting elements. This highly virus- and IFN-responsive chIFIT5 protein interacted with negative sense viral RNA structures that carried a triphosphate group on its 5\u2032 terminus (ppp-RNA). This interaction reduced the replication of RNA viruses in lentivirus-mediated IFIT5-stable chicken fibroblasts whereas CRISPR/Cas9-edited chIFIT5 gene knockout fibroblasts supported the replication of RNA viruses. Finally, we generated mosaic transgenic chicken embryos stably expressing chIFIT5 protein or knocked-down for endogenous chIFIT5 gene. Replication kinetics of RNA viruses in these transgenic chicken embryos demonstrated the antiviral potential of chIFIT5 in ovo.

The improvement of epidemiological surveillance has allowed live monitoring of epidemic progresses, while new molecular biological tools have allowed analysis of the various steps required for viral adaptation to their new hosts. These observations suggest lower transmissibility of viral strains at the start of epidemics. It is therefore essential to strengthen public health surveillance systems, so that swift moves can be made before viruses get adapted to humans.

It has become clear that viral genomic RNAs are not simply carriers of hereditary information, but rather are active players in many critical stages during replication. Indeed, functions such as cap-independent translation initiation mechanisms are, in some cases, primarily driven by RNA structural determinants. Other stages including reverse transcription initiation in retroviruses, nuclear export and viral packaging are specifically dependent on the proper 3-dimensional folding of multiple RNA domains to recruit necessary viral and host factors required for activity. Furthermore, a large-scale conformational change within the 5\u2032-untranslated region of HIV-1 has been proposed to regulate the temporal switch between viral protein synthesis and packaging. These RNA-dependent functions are necessary for replication of many human disease-causing viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus, West Nile virus, and HIV-1. The potential for antiviral development is currently hindered by a poor understanding of RNA-driven molecular mechanisms, resulting from a lack of structural information on large RNAs and ribonucleoprotein complexes. Herein, we describe the recent progress that has been made on characterizing these large RNAs and provide brief descriptions of the techniques that will be at the forefront of future advances. Ongoing and future work will contribute to a more complete understanding of the lifecycles of retroviruses and RNA viruses and potentially lead to novel antiviral strategies.","publish_time":"2014-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cantara, William A.; Olson, Erik D.; Forsyth, Karin Musier","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28a2d2486c20130148e9680d5204a52a8d3d28e3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/222deff053311aff793fe49a277b03a9fdb48987.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4252365.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214002500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24956407/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4252365?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214002500; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.06.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral packaging","viral genomic RNAs","structure of viral RNAs","RNA viruses","large RNAs","RNA-dependent functions","viral protein synthesis","poor understanding of RNA","RNA structural determinants","field of viral molecular biology","replication","molecular mechanisms","dimensional folding of multiple RNA domains","lack of structural information","lifecycles of retroviruses","critical stages","complete understanding","antiviral development","future work","cap-independent translation initiation mechanisms","human disease-causing viruses","reverse transcription initiation","carriers of hereditary information","novel antiviral strategies","untranslated region of HIV","forefront of future advances","SARS","severe acute respiratory syndrome","nuclear export","associated coronavirus","West Nile virus","active players","temporal switch","host factors","ribonucleoprotein complexes","brief descriptions","precipice","studies","cases","techniques","activity","large-scale conformational change","potential","recent progress","gap"],"language":"en"},

However, our understanding of the drivers of persistence of multiple AI subtypes is limited. We propose a stochastic model of AI transmission within an LBM that incorporates market size, turnover rate and the balance of direct versus environmental transmissibility. We investigate the relationship between these factors and the critical community size (CCS) for the persistence of single and multiple AI strains within an LBM. We fit different models of seeding from farms to two-strain surveillance data collected from Shantou, China. For a single strain and plausible estimates for continuous turnover rates and transmissibility, the CCS was approximately 11 800 birds, only a 4.2% increase in this estimate was needed to ensure persistence of the co-infecting strains (two strains in a single host). Precise values of CCS estimates were sensitive to changes in market turnover rate and duration of the latent period. Assuming a gradual daily sell rate of birds the estimated CCS was higher than when an instantaneous selling rate was assumed. We were able to reproduce prevalence dynamics similar to observations from a single market in China with infection seeded every 5\u201315 days, and a maximum non-seeding duration of 80 days. Our findings suggest that persistence of co-infections is more likely to be owing to sequential infection of single strains rather than ongoing transmission of both strains concurrently. In any given system for a fixed set of ecological and epidemiological conditions, there is an LBM size below which the risk of sustained co-circulation is low and which may suggest a clear policy opportunity to reduce the frequency of influenza co-infection in poultry.","publish_time":"2017-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pinsent, Amy; Pepin, Kim M.; Zhu, Huachen; Guan, Yi; White, Michael T.; Riley, Steven","journal":"Proc Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a7f47a771ace5d75afbd36064bb1a843f9821f83.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d0a5f35e229929f76c9c7fb1dcac16d5324c12e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5740266.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29212718/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.0715","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LBM","CCS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["persistence of single","single market","multiple AI strains","sequential infection of single strains","market turnover rate","co-infecting strains","market size","LBM size","multiple AI subtypes","persistence of co-infections","single host","estimated CCS","drivers of persistence","frequency of influenza co-infection","Precise values of CCS estimates","instantaneous selling rate","Multiple subtypes of avian influenza","stochastic model of AI transmission","days","China","gradual daily sell rate of birds","risk of sustained co-circulation","continuous turnover rates","critical community size","plausible estimates","maximum non-seeding duration","ongoing transmission","environmental transmissibility","strain surveillance data","different models of seeding","changes","farms","novel reassortants","observations","fixed set of ecological","epidemiological conditions","balance of direct","live bird markets","prevalence dynamics similar","LBMs","factors","Shantou","poultry","clear policy opportunity","given system","latent period","findings","relationship","increase","understanding"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We used the Global Burden of Diseases 2010 (GBD 2010) methodology to estimate the country-level burden of disease in KSA. We used data from systematic reviews of the literature, household survey data, antenatal clinic surveillance data, reportable disease notifications, disease registries, hospital admissions data, outpatient visit data, population-based cancer registries, active screening data, and other administrative data. RESULTS: Noncommunicable diseases and road traffic injuries became the leading cause of death and disability in KSA in 2010. Elevated body mass index was the leading risk factor for disease (7.02% for males and 4.61% for females in 2010). High glucose levels were the second leading disease risk factor for females (3.28%) and third for males (6.25%) in 2010. Preterm birth complications were the main cause for DALYs in 1990; however, in 2010, the leading cause of DALYs for males was road traffic injuries (12.40%) and for females it was major depressive disorder (7.88%). CONCLUSION: KSA is facing a rising burden of noncommunicable diseases and road traffic injuries as a result of rapid changes in behaviors. Our results demonstrate the need for major intervention to reduce these burdens and to engage other sectors of the government and the community in these efforts.","publish_time":"2014-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Memish, Ziad A.; Jaber, Sara; Mokdad, Ali H.; AlMazroa, Mohammad A.; Murray, Christopher J.L.; Al Rabeeah, Abdullah A.","journal":"Prev Chronic Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11e29fd44b612542dcb4724e582ed38d68cd93ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4184091.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd11.140176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275806/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease registries","administrative data","KSA","leading disease risk factor","leading cause of DALYs","household survey data","hospital admissions data","active screening data","road traffic injuries","leading cause of death","leading risk factor","country-level burden of disease","females","reportable disease notifications","Global Burden of Diseases","antenatal clinic surveillance data","rising burden of noncommunicable diseases","disability-adjusted life years","years of life lost attributable","main cause","risk factors","RESULTS","major intervention","major depressive disorder","population-based cancer registries","literature","outpatient","premature mortality","YLLs","Elevated body mass index","result of rapid changes","systematic reviews","Preterm birth complications","methodology","GBD","High glucose levels","YLDs","government","community","sectors","behaviors","burdens","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","need","efforts","METHODS","CONCLUSION","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

A surveillance programme has been put in place to determine etiological agents responsible for febrile, as well as afebrile respiratory illnesses in a military camp. The goal of the study is to better understand the epidemiology of these diseases and identify potential countermeasures to protect military recruits against them. METHODS: From Jan 2016 - Jan 2017, a total of 2647 respiratory cases were enrolled into the surveillance programme. The cases were further stratified into Febrile Respiratory Illness (FRI, with body temperature \u003E 37.5 \u00B0C) or Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI, with body temperature \u003C 37.5 \u00B0C). Nasal washes were collected and tested by multiplex PCR to detect 26 different pathogens. RESULTS: One thousand ninety five cases (41% of total cases) met the criteria of FRI in which 932 cases (85% of FRI cases) were screened positive for at least one virus. The most common etiological agents for FRI mono-infection cases were Adenovirus E and Rhinovirus. Recruits infected with H3N2 influenza, Influenza B and Adenovirus E viruses were most likely presented as FRI cases. Notably, H3N2 influenza resulted in the greatest rise in body temperature. The remaining 1552 cases (59% of total cases) met the criteria of ARI in which 1198 cases (77% of ARI cases) were screened positive for at least one virus. The most common etiological agent for ARI mono-infection was Rhinovirus. The distribution pattern for dual infections was different for ARI and FRI cases. Maximum number of pathogens detected in a sample was five for both groups. CONCLUSION: Previous studies on respiratory diseases in military focused largely on FRI cases. With the expanded surveillance to ARI cases, this study allows unbiased evaluation of the impact of respiratory disease pathogens among recruits in a military environment. The results show that several pathogens have a much bigger role in causing respiratory diseases in this cohort.

Literature review indicates that the governing factors can be categorized into architectural and environmental attributes. Among different methods commonly used for pricing, the hedonic price approach is viewed as the most suitable. However, the successful use of this method requires that homebuyers know and choose the attributes. Whilst choosing architectural attributes are not a problem for homebuyers, the same does not apply to environmental attributes. Previous studies by the authors have proposed some simple indicators for quantifying the environmental attributes. Based upon the developed performance indicators and the transaction records of two representative housing estates (Royal Ascot = RA and City One Shatin = COS), details of the properties, including transaction prices, architectural particulars and environmental characteristics were numerically transformed for the hedonic price analysis. The analysis results revealed that the willingness to pay (percentage of house price in parenthesis) for architectural and environmental attributes was HK$302.3/ft2 (5.8%) and HK$886.8/ft2 (28.2%), respectively, for RA and HK$1672.7/ft2 (31.9%) and HK$111.5/ft2 (3.5%) for COS.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CNKI (Chinese Database) for studies published as of March 2, 2020, and we searched references of identified articles. Studies were reviewed for methodological quality. A random-effects model was used to pool results. Heterogeneity was assessed using I(2). Publication bias was assessed using Egger\u0027s test. RESULTS: 43 studies involving 3600 patients were included. Among COVID-19 patients, fever (83.3% [95% CI 78.4\u201387.7]), cough (60.3% [54.2\u201366.3]), and fatigue (38.0% [29.8\u201346.5]) were the most common clinical symptoms. The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated C-reactive protein (68.6% [58.2\u201378.2]), decreased lymphocyte count (57.4% [44.8\u201369.5]) and increased lactate dehydrogenase (51.6% [31.4\u201371.6]). Ground-glass opacities (80.0% [67.3\u201390.4]) and bilateral pneumonia (73.2% [63.4\u201382.1]) were the most frequently reported findings on computed tomography. The overall estimated proportion of severe cases and case-fatality rate (CFR) was 25.6% (17.4\u201334.9) and 3.6% (1.1\u20137.2), respectively. CFR and laboratory abnormalities were higher in severe cases, patients from Wuhan, and older patients, but CFR did not differ by gender. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID-19 cases are symptomatic with a moderate CFR. Patients living in Wuhan, older patients, and those with medical comorbidities tend to have more severe clinical symptoms and higher CFR.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Leiwen; Wang, Bingyi; Yuan, Tanwei; Chen, Xiaoting; Ao, Yunlong; Fitzpatrick, Tom; Li, Peiyang; Zhou, Yiguo; Lin, Yifan; Duan, Qibin; Luo, Ganfeng; Fan, Song; Lu, Yong; Feng, Anping; Zhan, Yuewei; Liang, Bowen; Cai, Weiping; Zhang, Lin; Du, Xiangjun; Shu, Yuelong; Li, Linghua; Zou, Huachun","journal":"J Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0b42d2e142d27e329cb75ccd01e108c53696e77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151416.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320301705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283155/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.041; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301705?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["older patients","higher CFR","moderate CFR","studies","severe clinical symptoms","common laboratory abnormalities","Wuhan","common clinical symptoms","majority of COVID","results","overall estimated proportion of severe cases","comprehensive characterization of COVID","case-fatality rate","elevated C-reactive protein","Web of Science","CNKI","PubMed","EMBASE","current outbreak","Chinese Database","medical comorbidities","Publication bias","Egger\u0027s test","reported findings","computed tomography","random-effects model","references of identified articles","decreased lymphocyte count","increased lactate dehydrogenase","Ground-glass opacities","efforts","METHODS","methodological quality","CONCLUSIONS","fever","bilateral pneumonia","OBJECTIVE","gender","Heterogeneity","cough","fatigue"],"language":"en"},

Despite this heavy burden of disease, no concise studies have been published on the global research landscape so far. METHODS: We used the New Quality and Quantity Indices in Science platform to analyze global NSI research (n = 2987 articles) over the past 115 years using the Web of Science and parameters such as global versus country-specific research activities, semi-qualitative issues, and socioeconomic figures. RESULTS: Density-equalizing mapping showed that although a total of n = 106 countries participated in NSI research, large parts of Africa and South America were almost invisible regarding global participation in NSI research. Average citation rate (cr) analysis indicated a high rate for Switzerland (cr = 25.1), Italy (cr = 23.5), and Japan (cr = 19.2). Socioeconomic analysis revealed that the UK had the highest quotient Q(GDP) of 0.13 NSI-specific publications per bill. US-$ gross domestic product (GDP), followed by South Africa (Q(GDP) = 0.12). Temporal analysis of HIV versus hepatitis research indicated that NSI-HIV research culminated in the early 1990s, whereas NSI-hepatitis research increased over the observed period from the 1980s until the last decade. CONCLUSION: Albeit NSI research activity is generally increasing, the growth is asymmetrical from a global viewpoint. International strategies should be followed that put a focus on NSI in non-industrialized areas of the world.

A total of 450 ovines (250 sheep and 200 lambs) and 140 bovines (130 cows and 10 calves) were housed in two separated units, at the time of the outbreak. About half of the lambs had diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium sp. with a mortality rate of 80%; calves were not infected. Genomic DNA was extracted from an archived slide and from fecal specimens, and the parasite was identified as Cryptosporidium parvum by PCR and sequence analysis at the CpA135 gene. Genotyping at the GP60 gene showed the presence of a very rare genotype, IIaA20G2R1. Shortly after the outbreak was identified, the son of the farm\u0027s owner, aged 18 months, experienced an acute gastroenteritis and was hospitalized due to recurrent episodes of diarrhea, fever, vomiting and lack of appetite. The feces tested negative for bacteria and viruses, whereas cryptosporidiosis was diagnosed by microscopy and an immunochromatographic test. Molecular typing identified the C. parvum genotype IIaA20G2R1 in the feces of the child. This is the first case of transmission of cryptosporidiosis in Italy involving lambs as source of oocysts infectious to humans.","publish_time":"2013-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cacci\u00F2, Simone M.; Sannella, Anna Rosa; Mariano, Valeria; Valentini, Silvia; Berti, Franco; Tosini, Fabio; Pozio, Edoardo","journal":"Veterinary Parasitology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dac3bbf26b6f5e0785092144acd855176e341d13.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131239.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401712004232; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.08.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22954678/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401712004232","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs2NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lambs","outbreak of cryptosporidiosis","Cryptosporidium parvum","parvum genotype IIaA20G2R1","feces","calves","mixed sheep","rare genotype","CpA135 gene","GP60 gene","recurrent episodes of diarrhea","cattle farm of Central Italy","sequence analysis","fever","PCR","source of oocysts infectious","archived slide","months","fecal specimens","presence","parasite","bacteria","viruses","Molecular typing","case of transmission","farm\u0027s owner","humans","time","son","microscopy","mortality rate","bovines","acute gastroenteritis","Genomic DNA","separated units","lack of appetite","immunochromatographic test","Genotyping","cows","total","child","half"],"language":"en"},

Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of the virus-containing intestinal homogenate yielded two opalescent bands corresponding to the buoyant densities of 1.14\u20131.15 and 1.18\u20131.20g/ml, respectively. Coronaviral particles from intestinal contents or the sucrose density gradient preparation were mainly spherical in shape and had envelope and central depression. They were surrounded by a fringe of regularly spaced petal-shaped projections attached to the particles by a short stalk. Purified viruses hemagglutinated rabbit erythrocytes with a titer of 16.

The lymphoid chemokine, CXCL13, is critical for B cell recruitment and functional organization of peripheral lymphoid tissues, and CXCL13 levels are often elevated in the inflamed CNS. To more directly investigate the role of CXCL13 in CNS B cell migration, its role in animal models of infectious and inflammatory demyelinating disease was examined. During acute alphavirus encephalitis where viral clearance depends on the local actions of anti-viral antibodies, CXCL13 levels and B cell numbers increased in brain tissue over time. Surprisingly, however, CXCL13-deficient animals showed normal CNS B cell recruitment, unaltered CNS virus replication and clearance, and intact peripheral anti-viral antibody responses. During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), CNS levels of CXCL13 increased as symptoms emerged and equivalent numbers of B cells were identified among the CNS infiltrates of CXCL13-deficient mice compared to control animals. However, CXCL13-deficient mice did not sustain pathogenic anti-myelin T cell responses, consistent with their known propensity to develop more self-limited EAE. These data show that CXCL13 is dispensable for CNS B cell recruitment in both models. The disease course is unaffected by CXCL13 in a CNS infection paradigm that depends on a pathogen-specific B cell response, while it is heightened and prolonged by CXCL13 when myelin-specific CD4\u002B T cells drive CNS pathology. Thus, CXCL13 could be a therapeutic target in certain neuroinflammatory diseases, but not by blocking B cell recruitment to the CNS.","publish_time":"2011-07-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rainey-Barger, Emily K; Rumble, Julie M; Lalor, Stephen J.; Esen, Nilufer; Segal, Benjamin M; Irani, David N","journal":"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/129a9a36f9814b22fd37bfe550c6c746df954e96.json; document_parses/pdf_json/b830d94bad1731d4d22f0dc05b5b9d6f3b06ad83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3135968.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2010.10.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0889159110005088; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3135968?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20933590/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159110005088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs3NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS levels of CXCL13","CNS B cell migration","CNS infiltrates of CXCL13","CXCL13 levels","B cell numbers","normal CNS B cell recruitment","role of CXCL13","CNS pathology","inflamed CNS","CXCL13-deficient mice","CXCL13-deficient animals","importance of B cell surveillance","pathogen-specific B cell response","CNS infection paradigm","equivalent numbers of B cells","pathogenic anti-myelin T cell responses","unaltered CNS virus replication","viral clearance","intact peripheral anti-viral antibody responses","anti-CD20 antibody","local actions of anti-viral antibodies","T cells","myelin-specific CD4","control animals","lymphoid chemokine","self-limited EAE","disease course","functional organization of peripheral lymphoid tissues","animal models of infectious","inflammatory demyelinating disease","rituximab","symptoms","known propensity","central nervous system","therapeutic target","patients","brain tissue","certain neuroinflammatory diseases","acute alphavirus encephalitis","experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy","time","data"],"language":"en"},

A conceptual model of O(3) air pollution is developed based on the analysis of data obtained at Tung Chung (TC) in Hong Kong.

Backward trajectories simulation and graphical illustration of O(3) pollution suggested that super-regional (i.e. central and eastern China) and regional (i.e. Pearl River Delta, southern China) transport was another factor that contributed to high O(3) levels in Hong Kong. The photochemical O(3) formation, generally VOC-limited in Hong Kong, was controlled by a small number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Furthermore, the positive matrix factorization (PMF) simulation suggested that solvent usage and vehicular emissions are the major contributors to ambient VOCs in Hong Kong.

TLRs 1 and 3 were the most highly expressed TLRs. Protein expression for TLRs 2, 3, and 4 was observed on RPE cells and this expression was augmented by treatment with poly I:C or interferon-\u03B3 (IFN-\u03B3).

Although discussed here in the context of OM, during preceding or concurrent viral infection of the human respiratory tract, viral impairment of airway defenses and the resulting predisposition to subsequent bacterial coinfection are also known to be operational in the mid and lower airway as well.","publish_time":"2009-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bakaletz, Lauren O.","journal":"J Leukoc Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0663481b2eb5194d2a48d2ca2adec6fef3f2ec85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2812561.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1189/jlb.0709518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19843575/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OM","URT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial OM","lower airway","context of OM","viral impairment of airway defenses","concurrent viral infection","concurrent viral URT infection","primary host airway defenses","bacterial adherence","bacterial superinfection","rheological properties of airway mucus","subsequent bacterial coinfection","histopathology of airway mucosal epithelium","prevalent infection","URT viruses","human respiratory tract","molecular mechanisms","multifactorial disease","polymicrobial disease","host immune functions","resulting predisposition","multiple risk factors","general principle of compromise","expression of eukaryotic receptors","middle ear","incomplete understanding","inflammation","children"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we aimed to analyze candidate molecules for targeted therapy of scirrhous gastric cancer. We searched for molecules/metabolic activity that might be predominantly expressed in a subpopulation of scirrhous gastric cancer cells and might function as cancer stem cell markers. RESULTS: For this purpose, we investigated the expression of various cell surface markers and of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. These analyses showed that the scirrhous gastric cancer cell lines HSC-58 and HSC-44PE heterogeneously expressed CD13, while CD44, CDCP1, EpCAM and ABCG2 were expressed uniformly. Moreover, 10% of the total HSC-58 cell population expressed ALDH enzyme activity. A subpopulation of cells strongly positive for ALDH also expressed high levels of CD13, both of which are known as cancer stem cell markers. HSC-58 cells expressing high levels of CD13 showed lower sensitivity to a cancer drug cisplatin than cells with low levels of CD13. In contrast, CD13(-high) subpopulation of HSC-58 was more sensitive to an aminopeptidase N inhibitor bestatin. In terms of antibody-drug therapy, anti-CD13-immunotoxin was highly cytotoxic towards HSC-58 cells and was more cytotoxic than anti-EpCAM-immunotoxin. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CD13 is a suitable cell surface candidate for targeted antibody-drug therapy of scirrhous gastric cancer.","publish_time":"2016-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nohara, Shigeo; Kato, Kazunori; Fujiwara, Daisuke; Sakuragi, Naoya; Yanagihara, Kazuyoshi; Iwanuma, Yoshimi; Kajiyama, Yoshiaki","journal":"Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bcf62c5b4788a23d85b435de3ea35297d580320.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185882.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26774363/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinre.2015.11.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210740115002843; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210740115002843","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALDH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subpopulation of scirrhous gastric cancer cells","scirrhous gastric cancer cell lines HSC","cancer stem cell markers","targeted therapy of scirrhous gastric cancer","subpopulation of HSC","high levels of CD13","targeted antibody-drug therapy of scirrhous gastric cancer","cancer drug cisplatin","subpopulation of cells","low levels of CD13","anti-CD13-immunotoxin","cell population","total HSC","suitable cell surface candidate","expression of various cell surface markers","ALDH enzyme activity","candidate molecules","anti-EpCAM-immunotoxin","metabolic activity","terms of antibody","peritoneal dissemination","advanced lymph node metastasis","lower sensitivity","aldehyde dehydrogenase","early stage","CD44","aminopeptidase N inhibitor bestatin","CDCP1","prognosis","ABCG2","data","BACKGROUND","analyses","purpose","CONCLUSION","contrast","RESULTS","study"],"language":"en"},

A total of 199 calves from nine commercial farms aged between 21 and 55 days old at the start of study were included and randomly allocated to one of three groups. Calves on all farms were observed for a period of 78 days post treatment, using both parasitological (oocyst excretion), and clinical parameters (faecal score and body weight). The assessment of efficacy was based on both control of oocyst excretion, and on the average daily weight gains throughout the study. During the whole study period, the mean number of days with diarrhoea (\u22652) was similar (0.7 days) between treated groups. Excretion in the untreated group peaked at 21 days after treatment. In both the diclazuril and toltrazuril-treated groups, mean oocyst excretion decreased dramatically in the five days following treatment. Thereafter, particularly towards the end of the study period, oocyst counts and percentage levels of E. zuernii were highest in the toltrazuril-treated group. In pooled data from all trial sites, the average daily weight gain was significantly (p =0.01) higher (\u002B0.057kg/day) in the diclazuril group when compared to the toltrazuril group, and the average body weight gain of the diclazuril treated group was 4.4kg higher than the toltrazuril group. On eight of the nine trial sites, the average daily gain was greater in the diclazuril group than in the toltrazuril group. This study demonstrates that, over an extended observation period of 78 days, metaphylactic treatment with both diclazuril and toltrazuril reduces the impact of coccidiosis, but greater performance benefits based on average daily weight gains, were achieved following the use of diclazuril.","publish_time":"2014-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Philippe, P.; Alzieu, J.

Previous studies mainly focused on Wuhan and typical symptoms. We analysed 74 confirmed COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics. DESIGN: COVID-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type. Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province. RESULTS: Among enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8% had pre-existing liver disease. Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97%) and 23 (31.08%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14%) and 118 (20.45%).

Compared with VicS-v, the more attenuated VicS-del strain had two non-synonymous changes in the non-structural protein 6 (nsp6), a transmembrane (TM) domain that may participate in autocatalytic release of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, a polymorphic difference at the end of the S2 gene, which coincided with the body transcription-regulating sequence (B-TRS) of mRNA 3 and a truncated open reading frame for a peptide encoded by gene 4 (4b). These genetic differences could be responsible for the differences between these variants in pathogenicity in vivo, and replication in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome showed that VicS-v and VicS-del did not cluster with strains from other countries, supporting the hypothesis that Australian IBV strains have been evolving independently for some time, and analyses of individual polymerase peptide and S glycoprotein genes suggested a distant common ancestor with no recent recombination. This study suggests the potential role of the TM domain in nsp6, the integrity of the S2 protein and the B-TRS 3, and the putative accessory protein 4b, as well as the 3\u2032 untranslated region, in the virulence and replication of IBV and has provided a better understanding of relationships between the Australian vaccine strain of IBV and those used elsewhere.","publish_time":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quinteros, Jos\u00E9 A.; Markham, Philip F.; Lee, Sang-Won; Hewson, Kylie A.; Hartley, Carol A.; Legione, Alistair R.; Coppo, Mauricio J.

Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a rare primary human immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent cutaneous and systemic infections, as well as atopy and cancer susceptibility(5). DOCK8, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor highly expressed in lymphocytes, regulates actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for migration through collagen-dense tissues, such as skin(6). Analyzing deep metagenomic sequencing data from DOCK8-deficient skin samples demonstrated a notable increase in eukaryotic viral representation and diversity as compared to healthy volunteers.

Protecting the blood supply from emerging infectious threats remains a serious concern in the transfusion medicine community. Transfusion services can employ indirect measures such as surveillance, hemovigilance, and donor questioning (defense), protein-, or nucleic acid based direct testing (detection), or pathogen inactivation of blood products (destruction) as strategies to mitigate the risk of transmission-transmitted infection. In the North American context, emerging threats currently include dengue, chikungunya, and hepatitis E viruses, and Babesia protozoan parasites. The 2003 SARS and 2014 Ebola outbreaks illustrate the potential of epidemics unlikely to be transmitted by blood transfusion but disruptive to blood systems. Donor-free blood products such as ex vivo generated red blood cells offer a theoretical way to avoid transmission-transmitted infection risk, although biological, engineering, and manufacturing challenges must be overcome before this approach becomes practical. Similarly, next generation sequencing of all nucleic acid in a blood sample is currently possible but impractical for generalized screening. Pathogen inactivation systems are in use in different jurisdictions around the world, and are starting to gain regulatory approval in North America. Cost concerns make it likely that pathogen inactivation will be contemplated by blood operators through the lens of health economics and risk-based decision making, rather than in zero-risk paradigms previously embraced for transfusable products. Defense of the blood supply from infectious disease risk will continue to require innovative combinations of surveillance, detection, and pathogen avoidance or inactivation.","publish_time":"2016-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Walsh, Geraldine M.; Shih, Andrew W.; Solh, Ziad; Golder, Mia; Schubert, Peter; Fearon, Margaret; Sheffield, William P.","journal":"Transfusion Medicine Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d40f2e2126acaf365d3b5dbe93e3a2b7982907c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126603.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmrv.2016.02.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0887796316300050; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0887796316300050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26962008/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs5OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["North America"],"keyphrases":["blood transfusion","blood systems","blood supply","blood operators","blood sample","pathogen inactivation of blood products","risk of transmission","red blood cells","selected blood donors","Donor-free blood products","risk paradigms","transmission-transmitted infection risk","Pathogen inactivation systems","infectious disease risk","risk-based decision making","pathogen avoidance","Transfusion services","emerging threats","detection","emerging infectious threats","nucleic acid","transfusion medicine community","transfusable products","defense","known pathogens","donor questioning","direct testing","innovative combinations of surveillance","Abstract Testing donations","North American context","serious concern","hepatitis E viruses","theoretical way","lens of health economics","dengue","chikungunya","hemovigilance","low levels","indirect measures","engineering","protein","Babesia protozoan parasites","destruction","strategies","potential of epidemics unlikely","Ebola outbreaks","different jurisdictions","manufacturing challenges","Cost concerns","generalized screening","developed countries","world","regulatory approval","generation sequencing","approach","SARS"],"language":"en"},

The emergence of a new antigen type of influenza A virus (H5N1) in Hong Kong during 1997 and 1998 threatened a possible pandemic of a new influenza infection. The investigation for anti-influenza chemotherapies has progressed in the last decade whereas clinical trials of new compounds have been limited to amantadine, rimantadine and ribavirin. Fusion inhibitors which directly inhibit conformational change of haemagglutinin (HA), protease inhibitors which inhibit cleavage of HA to HA1 and HA2, RNA transcription inhibitors which inhibit cap formation of mRNA and antisense oligonucleotides targeted at mRNA of PB2 (a part of viral RNA polymerase) have been reported, in their development phases. Recently, 2 neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir (GS 4104), were used in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with influenza. Both agents showed promising results. A polyoxometalate, PM-523, inhibits fusion between the virus envelope and cell membrane and inhibits the penetration of the virus into cells. This compound has shown potent anti-influenza activity and synergistic inhibitory activity in combination with ribavirin or zanamivir in vitro and in vivo. Resistant strains for zanamivir, oseltamivir or PM-523 have been isolated. The analysis of mutation points of these strains have contributed to the investigation of the antiviral mechanisms of action of these compounds and the mechanism of resistance of the mutants to these compounds.","publish_time":"2012-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shigeta, Shiro","journal":"Drugs R D","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75db64673bd25ec409a30d07762a31bccbb1a939.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100840/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozcw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["Influenza virus infections","new influenza infection","Fusion inhibitors","anti-influenza chemotherapies","zanamivir","potent anti-influenza activity","new antigen type of influenza","protease inhibitors","virus envelope","clinical trials of new compounds","RNA transcription inhibitors","oseltamivir","ribavirin","investigation","cleavage of HA","mRNA of PB2","treatment of patients","Resistant strains","synergistic inhibitory activity","cap formation of mRNA","viral RNA polymerase","immunocompromised states","antisense oligonucleotides","HA1","HA2","high risk individuals","combination","cardiopulmonary disorders","infants","conformational change of haemagglutinin","H5N1","decade","severe manifestations","cell membrane","antiviral mechanisms of action","elderly","penetration","mechanism of resistance","possible pandemic","amantadine","analysis of mutation points","mutants","emergence","Hong Kong","neuraminidase","GS","agents","promising results","fatalities","rimantadine","cells","development phases","polyoxometalate"],"language":"en"},

The diagnostic approach to eosinophilia in travelers returning from the tropics primarily includes three stool examinations for worm eggs and, if necessary, serological tests for helminths. Additionally, a chest x\u2011ray, an ultrasound of the abdomen and an electrocardiogram (ECG) provide information about organ involvement. Recently, specialized laboratories use molecular techniques (multiplex PCR) to detect worm eggs and intestinal parasites in the stool, which provide a significantly higher sensitivity than traditional stool examination techniques.

In this review, an attempt has been made to discuss the available knowledge within the framework of a problem-oriented approach, which appears to provide a more clinically useful insight than a drug-centred review. Following a brief discussion of the scanty data and the most interesting models to which reference can be made from a pharmacokinetic point of view (the burn patient being taken as an example), the review concentrates on the main general intervention strategies in intensive care patients. These are based mainly on non-pharmacological measures (correction of fluid and electrolyte balance, total parenteral nutrition, enterai nutrition, oxygenation and ventilatory management) and are discussed with respect to the specific challenge they present in various clinical conditions and organ failure situations. In addition, 4 major selected clinical conditions where general management criteria and careful use of prophylactic and therapeutic drug treatments must interact to cope with the variety of presentations and problems are reviewed. These include: acute cerebral damage; anti-infective prophylaxis and therapy; cardiovascular emergencies; and problems of haemostasis. Each problem is analysed in such a way as to frame the pharmacological intervention in its broader context of the underlying (established or hypothesised) pathophysiology, with special attention being paid to those methodological issues which allow an appreciation of the degree of reliability of the data and the recommendations which appear to be practiced (often haphazardly) in intensive care units. The thorough review of the published literature provided (up to mid-1986) clearly shows that in this field the quality of randomised controlled and epidemiological studies is rather unsatisfactory. It would be highly beneficial to research and to clinical care if larger multicentric protocols and prospective epidemiological comparative investigations could be carried out to investigate more timely and adequately the variables which determine drug action, and the final outcome in the many subgroups of patients which must be considered in a proper stratification of intensive care unit populations.","publish_time":"2012-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farina, Maria Luisa; Bonati, Maurizio; Iapichino, Gaetano; Pesenti, Antonio; Procaccio, Francesco; Boselli, Luigi; Langer, Martin; Graziina, Augusta; Tognoni, Gianni","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0231e91dbdf6a9e93b6816f535331328e54982ed.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101565/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozkz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical care","intensive care patients","intensive care settings","intensive care units","various clinical conditions","evolving clinical conditions","drug-centred review","major selected clinical conditions","application of clinical pharmacological concepts","pharmacological intervention","review concentrates","thorough review","proper stratification of intensive care unit populations","therapeutic drug treatments","drug action","difficult problems","problems of haemostasis","general management criteria","non-pharmacological measures","enterai nutrition","main general intervention strategies","therapeutic standards","ventilatory management","epidemiological studies","scanty data","subgroups of patients","total parenteral nutrition","quality of randomised controlled","controlled background information","problem-oriented approach","prospective epidemiological comparative investigations","larger multicentric protocols","careful use of prophylactic","anti-infective prophylaxis","electrolyte balance","therapy","correction of fluid","cardiovascular emergencies","oxygenation","framework","lack","organ failure situations","acute cerebral damage","burn patient","final outcome","specific challenge","appreciation","pharmacokinetic point of view","interesting models","published literature","example","broader context","drugs","addition","research","special attention","methodological issues","degree of reliability","useful insight","pathophysiology","reference","brief discussion","field","respect","variables","way","available knowledge","recommendations","variety of presentations","impact","attempt"],"language":"en"},

However, no systematic approach has been developed for the study of inflammatory lung diseases with often complex and highly heterogeneous disease etiologies. We have devised an internally standardized flow cytometry approach that can identify parallel inflammatory alveolar macrophage phenotypes in both the mouse and human lungs. In mice, lung innate immune cell alterations during endotoxin challenge, influenza virus infection, and in two genetic models of chronic obstructive lung disease could be segregated based on the presence or absence of CD11b alveolar macrophage upregulation and lung eosinophilia. Additionally, heightened alveolar macrophage CD11b expression was a novel feature of acute lung exacerbations in the SHIP-1(\u2212/\u2212) model of chronic obstructive lung disease, and anti-CD11b antibody administration selectively blocked inflammatory CD11b(pos) but not homeostatic CD11b(neg) alveolar macrophages in vivo. The identification of analogous profiles in respiratory disease patients highlights this approach as a translational avenue for lung disease endotyping and suggests that heterogeneous innate immune cell phenotypes are an underappreciated component of the human lung disease microenvironment.

METHODS: Forty-seven patients underwent LDLT in our institute, 16 for emergencies and 31 as elective procedures. The emergency LDLT status was applied to cases in which the time period between referral to our institution and transplantation did not exceed 10 days, and in which liver failure was accompanied by the presence of any degree of hepatic encephalopathy. RESULTS: With regard to preoperative factors, age (P = 0.03), the model for end-stage liver disease score (P = 0.001), preoperative tracheal intubation (P = 0.001), ratio between arterial oxygen tension and fractional inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio) (P = 0.03), steroid therapy use (P = 0.001), lymphocyte count (P = 0.02), and cases requiring hemodiafiltration (P = 0.001) differed significantly between the two groups. Postoperative pneumonia occurred more frequently in emergency LDLT patients than in elective LDLT patients (P = 0.006). Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) was the main cause of postoperative death in emergency LDLT patients, and, in a univariate analysis, a preoperative status of high serum (1 \u2192 3)-\u03B2-d-glucan (\u003E20 pg/ml, P = 0.001), advanced age (\u003E52 years, P = 0.02), and a low PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (\u003C320, P = 0.01) were identified as factors predictive of IPA. CONCLUSION: Careful perioperative management, including preoperative investigation of aspergillosis and empiric antibiotic therapy, should be considered for emergency LDLT patients who fulfill IPA risk factors.","publish_time":"2011-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takeda, Kazuhisa; Tanaka, Kuniya; Kumamoto, Takafumi; Nojiri, Kazunori; Mori, Ryutaro; Taniguchi, Koichi; Matsuyama, Ryusei; Endo, Itaru","journal":"Surg Today","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/925ca3b33bea97841a8b51b24676eb5cc5d758a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101615.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101615/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzExMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["emergency LDLT patients","elective LDLT patients","emergency LDLT status","preoperative factors","IPA risk factors","preoperative investigation of aspergillosis","elective living-donor liver transplantation","preoperative tracheal intubation","liver failure","preoperative status of high serum","postoperative mortality","Postoperative pneumonia","elective procedures","cases","predictive of IPA","FiO","main cause of postoperative death","advanced age","low PaO","end-stage liver disease score","fractional inspired oxygen","arterial oxygen tension","empiric antibiotic therapy","Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis","steroid therapy use","Careful perioperative management","presence","model","referral","institution","time period","univariate analysis","regard","glucan","degree of hepatic encephalopathy","CONCLUSION","emergencies","days","pg","years","RESULTS","institute","lymphocyte count","\u03B2-d","PURPOSE","hemodiafiltration","METHODS","groups"],"language":"en"},

A small proportion of patients who had this condition developed severe respiratory failure that was unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions. In this report, we describe characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of critically ill patients in Canada who had H1N1-2009 infection and were treated with extracorporeal lung support (ECLS). METHODS: We report the findings of a case series of six patients supported with ECLS who were included in a cohort study of critically ill patients with confirmed H1N1-2009 infection. The patients were treated in Canadian adult and pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) from April 16, 2009 to August 12, 2009. We describe the nested sample treated with ECLS and compare it with the larger sample. RESULTS: During the study period, 168 patients in Canada were admitted to ICUs for severe respiratory failure due to confirmed H1N1-2009 infection. Due to profound hypoxemia unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions, six (3.6%) of these patients were treated with ECLS in four ICUs. Four patients were treated with veno-venous pump-driven extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO), and two patients were treated with pumpless lung assist (NovaLung iLA). The mean duration of support was 15 days. Four of the six patients survived (66.6%), one of the surviving patients was supported with iLA and the other three surviving patients were supported with ECMO. The two deaths were due to multiorgan failure, which occurred while the patients were on ECLS. INTERPRETATION: Extracorporeal lung support may be an effective treatment for patients who have H1N1-2009 infection and refractory hypoxemia. Survival of these patients treated with ECLS is similar to that reported for patients who have acute respiratory distress syndrome of other etiologies and are treated with ECMO.","publish_time":"2010-01-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freed, Darren H.; Henzler, Dietrich; White, Chris W.; Fowler, Robert; Zarychanski, Ryan; Hutchison, Jamie; Arora, Rakesh C.; Manji, Rizwan A.; Legare, Jean-Francois; Drews, Tanya; Veroukis, Stasa; Kesselman, Murray; Guerguerian, Anne-Marie; Kumar, Anand","journal":"Can J Anaesth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f0313e75e412911a91bd9914109d3b54d35fbf73.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101672.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101672/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzE0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECLS","ECMO"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["ill patients","surviving patients","small proportion of patients","ECLS","confirmed H1N1","infection","severe respiratory failure","extracorporeal lung support","ICUs","major cause of respiratory failure","multiorgan failure","Canada","conventional therapeutic interventions","vv-ECMO","report","acute respiratory distress syndrome","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","profound hypoxemia unresponsive","pumpless lung assist","mean duration of support","effective treatment","NovaLung iLA","study period","cohort study","refractory hypoxemia","nested sample","larger sample","pediatric intensive care units","Canadian adult","etiologies","veno-venous pump","outcomes","condition","mechanical ventilation","case series","findings","days","characteristics","virus","INTERPRETATION","RESULTS","deaths","Survival","METHODS","influenza","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: From October 21, 2009 to February 14, 2010 196 ILI patients were admitted, of which 66 tested positive for Influenza A H1N1. The patients with H1N1 infection were younger (43 years vs. 65 years; P \u003C 0.01), more patients were pregnant (P \u003C 0.01), had allergies (P \u003C 0.05) or, asthma (P \u003C 0.01).

While secondary pulmonary hypertension predominantly results from acute or chronic left ventricular failure, characteristic gene defects or predisposing risk factors lead to various forms of primary pulmonary hypertension. Despite its diverse pathogenesis, pulmonary hypertension exhibits a uniform cellular pathophysiology in the pulmonary microcirculation. The dysfunction of lung vascular endothelial cells, which are the front line in response to hemodynamic changes in the pulmonary circulation, is the pathophysiological driving force of pulmonary hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by a reduced production of vasodilative, anti-proliferative mediators and an increased release of vasoconstrictive, proliferative factors. This apparent imbalance not only enhances pulmonary vasoconstriction, but supports pathologic remodeling processes in the vascular intima and media. In addition, the pulmonary endothelium recruits platelets and leukocytes, thus, contributing to further release of vasoconstrictive and proliferative mediators and characteristic thrombus formation. These endothelium-derived pathomechanisms amplify each other, further enhance pulmonary vascular resistance, and finally result in fixation of the hypertensive state. Hence, pulmonary hypertension not only describes an alteration of lung hemodynamics, but comprises a complex set of pathophysiological events in both lung parenchymal cells and circulating blood cells. For development of new therapeutical strategies, the multifactorial character of the disease should be considered.","publish_time":"2014-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuebler, W.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the pulmonary pathology caused by H9N2 viral infection in mice. Six- to eight-week-old BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with 1 \u00D7 10(4) MID(50) of A/Chicken/Hebei/4/2008(H9N2) virus. Clinical signs, pathological changes and viral replication in lungs, arterial blood gas, and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were observed at different time points after infection. A control group was infected intranasally with noninfectious allantoic fluid. H9N2-infected mice exhibited severe respiratory syndrome, with a mortality rate of 60%. Gross observations showed that infected lungs were highly edematous. Major histopathological changes in infected lungs included diffuse pneumonia and alveolar damage, with neutrophil-dominant inflammatory cellular infiltration, interstitial and alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and severe bronchiolitis/peribronchiolitis. In addition, H9N2 viral infection resulted in severe progressive hypoxemia, lymphopenia, and a significant increase in neutrophils, tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 and interleukin-6 in BALF. The features described above satisfy the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Our data show that H9N2 viral infection resulted in ARDS in mice, and this may facilitate studies of the pathogenesis of future potential H9N2 disease in humans.","publish_time":"2009-11-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Guangcun; Bi, Jianmin; Kong, Fuli; Li, Xuezhu; Xu, Qiang; Dong, Jun; Zhang, Miaojie; Zhao, Lihong; Luan, Zhihua; Lv, Nana; Qiao, Jian","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/810a884b50ef799b45a0023d4682e12f6bd60fcb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7101852.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101852/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzIxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["A/Chicken/Hebei","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["H9N2-infected mice","H9N2 viral infection","infected lungs","viral replication","H9N2 avian influenza viruses","c mice","severe respiratory syndrome","pathogenesis of future potential H9N2 disease","severe bronchiolitis","BALF","ARDS","humans","severe progressive hypoxemia","alveolar edema","alveolar damage","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Major histopathological changes","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","noninfectious allantoic fluid","neutrophil-dominant inflammatory cellular infiltration","cytokines","diffuse pneumonia","arterial blood gas","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","significant increase","neutrophils","hemorrhage","pulmonary pathology","infections","interleukin","lymphopenia","criteria","Clinical signs","swine","week-old BALB","studies","different time points","present study","mortality rate","peribronchiolitis","Hebei","Gross observations","addition","data","control group","purpose","countries","Chicken","features"],"language":"en"},

Patients often suffer from life-threatening infections, suggesting an additional immunodeficiency. We describe for the first time the detailed infectious and immunological phenotype of MECP2 duplication syndrome. 17/27 analyzed patients suffered from pneumonia, 5/27 from at least one episode of sepsis. Encapsulated bacteria (S.pneumoniae, H.influenzae) were frequently isolated. T-cell immunity showed no gross abnormalities in 14/14 patients and IFNy-secretion upon ConA-stimulation was not decreased in 6/7 patients. In 6/21 patients IgG(2)-deficiency was detected \u2013 in 4/21 patients accompanied by IgA-deficiency, 10/21 patients showed low antibody titers against pneumococci. Supra-normal IgG(1)-levels were detected in 11/21 patients and supra-normal IgG(3)-levels were seen in 8/21 patients \u2013 in 6 of the patients as combined elevation of IgG(1) and IgG(3). Three of the four patients with IgA/IgG(2)-deficiency developed multiple severe infections. Upon infections pronounced acute-phase responses were common: 7/10 patients showed CRP values above 200 mg/l. Our data for the first time show systematically that increased susceptibility to infections in MECP2 duplication syndrome is associated with IgA/IgG(2)-deficiency, low antibody titers against pneumococci and elevated acute-phase responses. So patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome and low IgA/IgG(2) may benefit from prophylactic substitution of sIgA and IgG.

METHODS: We assessed the sublingual microcirculation in seven consecutive patients with acute lung injury related to influenza A (H1N1) infection. The evaluation was carried out using sidestream dark field (SDF) imaging within the first 96 hr after the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. Thenar oxygen saturation (StO(2)) was also measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a vascular occlusion test. In addition, the Lung Injury Score (LIS) and the APACHE II and SOFA scores were recorded. RESULTS: All patients received invasive mechanical ventilation and at least one of the following adjuvant therapies: inhaled nitric oxide (n = 4), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 1), prone position (n = 4), recruitment maneuver (n = 3), and hydrocortisone 50 mg\u00B7hr(\u22126) (n = 6). The median time from admission to microcirculatory assessment was 21 hr. Three patients had bacterial superinfection. The median LIS and PaO(2)/F(i)O(2) were 2.5 (2.25-3.25) and 178 (158-212), respectively. Three subjects were treated with norepinephrine. During a vascular occlusion test, the microcirculation was moderately to severely compromised with a NIRS ascending slope of 2.39%\u00B7sec(\u22121) (1.75-2.67%\u00B7sec(\u22121)), 66% (60-86%) of perfused small vessels in the sublingual microcirculation, and a microvascular flow index of 1.9 (1.3-2.6). The degree of microcirculatory abnormalities detected by the NIRS and SDF imaging techniques was correlated with the severity of the disease, as reflected by the SOFA and APACHE II scores.

Oseltamivir is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for use in the clinical management of pandemic and seasonal influenza of varying severity, and as the primary antiviral agent for treatment of avian H5N1 influenza infection in humans. This article is a nonsystematic review of the experience gained from the first 10 years of using oseltamivir for influenza infections since its launch in early 2000, emphasizing recent advances in our understanding of the product and its clinical utility in five main areas. The article reviews the pharmacokinetics of oseltamivir and its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, including information on special populations such as children and elderly adults, and the co-administration of oseltamivir with other agents. This is followed by a summary of data on the effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment and prophylaxis in patients with all types of influenza, including pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and avian H5N1 influenza. The implications of changes in susceptibility of circulating influenza viruses to oseltamivir and other antiviral agents are also described, as is the emergence of antiviral resistance during and after the 2009 pandemic. The fourth main section deals with the safety profile of oseltamivir in standard and special patient populations, and reviews spontaneously reported adverse event data from the pandemic and pre-pandemic periods and the topical issue of neuropsychiatric adverse events. Finally, the article considers the pharmacoeconomics of oseltamivir in comparison with vaccination and usual care regimens, and as a component of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies.","publish_time":"2011-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, James R.; Rayner, Craig R.; Donner, Barbara; Wollenhaupt, Martina; Klumpp, Klaus; Dutkowski, Regina","journal":"Adv Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/540d6dac7f1b43770697aec20776513d06cf999e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101998/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["F.

Free radical reactions have been implicated in the pathology of more than 50 human diseases. Radicals and other reactive oxygen species are formed constantly in the human body, both by deliberate synthesis (e.g. by activated phagocytes) and by chemical side- reactions. They are removed by enzymic and nonenzymic antioxidant defence systems. Oxidative stress, occurring when antioxidant defences are inadequate, can damage lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and DNA. A few clinical conditions are caused by oxidative stress, but more often the stress results from the disease. Sometimes it then makes a significant contribution to the disease pathology, and sometimes it does not. Several antioxidants are available for therapeutic use. They include molecules naturally present in the body [superoxide dismutase (SOD), \u03B1-tocopherol, glutathione and its precursors, ascorbic acid, adenosine, lactoferrin and carotenoids] as well as synthetic antioxidants [such as thiols, ebselen (PZ51), xanthine oxidase inhibitors, inhibitors of phagocyte function, iron ion chelators and probucol]. The therapeutic efficacy of SOD, \u03B1- tocopherol and ascorbic acid in the treatment of human disease is generally unimpressive to date although dietary deficiencies of the last two molecules should certainly be avoided. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors may be of limited relevance as antioxidants for human use. Exciting preliminary results with probucol (antiatherosclerosis), ebselen (anti-inflammatory), and iron ion chelators (in thalassaemia, leukaemia, malaria, stroke, traumatic brain injury and haemorrhagic shock) need to be confirmed by controlled clinical trials. Clinical testing of N-acetylcysteine in HIV-1-positive subjects may also be merited. A few drugs already in clinical use may have some antioxidant properties, but this ability is not widespread and drug- derived radicals may occasionally cause significant damage.","publish_time":"2012-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Halliwell, Barry","journal":"Drugs","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d54e2a8d34b11ab4c925b429270bd840dee8a8bc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102057/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzI5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human use","clinical use","human body","treatment of human disease","human diseases","therapeutic use","disease pathology","stress results","Oxidative stress","clinical conditions","clinical trials","xanthine oxidase inhibitors","ascorbic acid","iron ion chelators","\u03B1-tocopherol","\u03B1- tocopherol","probucol","ebselen","antioxidant defences","antioxidant properties","synthetic antioxidants","Clinical testing of N","Free radical reactions","significant damage","molecules","inhibitors of phagocyte function","therapeutic efficacy of SOD","nonenzymic antioxidant defence systems","significant contribution","drug- derived radicals","reactive oxygen species","Exciting preliminary results","species capable of independent existence","stroke","traumatic brain injury","limited relevance","malaria","leukaemia","antiatherosclerosis","thalassaemia","HIV","lipids","acetylcysteine","adenosine","carotenoids","superoxide dismutase","precursors","date","anti-inflammatory","glutathione","PZ51","haemorrhagic shock","proteins","dietary deficiencies","ability","lactoferrin","thiols","deliberate synthesis","phagocytes","carbohydrates","DNA","positive subjects","drugs","unpaired electrons"],"language":"en"},

Therapeutic actions are limited to vaccines and a few anti-viral drugs. Polygala (P.) japonica herba is rich in Polygalasaponin F (PSF, C(53)H(86)O(23)), used for acute bronchitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, amygdalitis, and respiratory tract infections treatment in China. Hypercytokinemia is often correlated with severe pneumonia caused by several influenza viruses. PSF was reported to have anti-inflammatory effects and its mechanism is associated with the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03BAB signaling pathway. The action of PSF to alleviate pulmonary inflammation caused by influenza A virus (IAV) infection requires careful assessment. In the present study, we evaluated the effect and mechanism of PSF on mice with pneumonia caused by influenza H1N1 (A/FM/1/47). METHODS: Mice were infected intranasally with fifteen 50% mouse lethal challenge doses (MLD(50)) of influenza virus. BALB/c mice were treated with PSF or oseltamivir (oral administration) for 2 h post-infection and received concomitant treatment for 5 days after infection. On day 6 post-infection, 10 mice per group were killed to collect related samples, measure body weight and lung wet weight, and detect the viral load, cytokine, prostaglandins, pathological changes, and cell pathway protein expression in the lungs. In addition, the survival experiments were carried out to investigate the survival of mice. The expression profile of cell pathway proteins was detected and analyzed using a broad pathway antibody array and confirmed the findings from the array by western blotting. RESULTS: Polygalasaponin F and oseltamivir can protect against influenza viral infection in mice. PSF and oseltamivir significantly relieved the signs and symptoms, reduced body weight loss, and improved the survival rate of H1N1-infected mice. Moreover, PSF efficiently decreased the level of interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03B1, IL-4, interferon (IFN)-\u03B3, thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)), and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in lung tissues of mice infected with influenza virus (p \u003C 0.05\u20130.01). Oseltamivir had a similar effect to lung cytokine of PSF, but did not decrease the levels of TXA(2) and PGE(2). There was a twofold or greater increase in four cell pathway protein, namely NF-\u03BAB p65 (2.68-fold), I-kappa-B-alpha (I\u03BAB\u03B1) (2.56-fold), and MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) (7.15-fold) assessed in the array induced by influenza virus. Western blotting showed that the expression of these proteins was significantly decreased in lung after influenza virus challenge in PSF and oseltamivir-treated mice (p \u003C 0.05\u20130.01). CONCLUSION: Polygalasaponin F appears to be able to augment protection against IAV infection in mice via attenuation of pulmonary inflammatory responses. Its effect on IAV-induced pulmonary inflammation was associated with suppression of Raf/MEK/ERK and NF-\u03BAB expressions.","publish_time":"2019-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ye, Yi; Wang, Huixian; Liu, Jinyuan; Zhao, Fang; Xu, Peiping","journal":"Inflammopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e55b25fed065fba0ac677e1e74577cb14d207c9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102181.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102181/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSF","PGE","MAPK/ERK","Raf/MEK/ERK"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["survival of mice","infected mice","influenza viral infection","c mice","oseltamivir-treated mice","influenza H1N1","mechanism of PSF","influenza virus challenge","lung cytokine of PSF","lung tissues of mice","influenza viruses","action of PSF","IAV infection","h post-infection","cell pathway protein expression","Polygalasaponin F","fold","expression profile of cell pathway proteins","lung wet weight","viral load","pulmonary inflammation","broad pathway antibody array","NF-\u03BAB p65","NF-\u03BAB expressions","acute viral respiratory illness","measure body weight","severe pneumonia","similar effect","anti-viral drugs","survival rate of H1N1","survival experiments","western blotting","PGE","reduced body weight loss","respiratory tract infections treatment","concomitant treatment","attenuation of pulmonary inflammatory responses","ERK kinase","nuclear factor","acute bronchitis","levels of TXA","tumor necrosis factor","mouse lethal challenge doses","amygdalitis","pathological changes","TNF","prostaglandins","symptoms","findings","signs","high morbidity","related samples","oral administration","vaccines","japonica herba","suppression of Raf","MLD","greater increase","group","IFN","interferon","I\u03BAB\u03B1","China","MAPK","MEK1","pharyngitis","lungs","protection","kappa-B","level of interleukin","careful assessment","alpha","mortality","thromboxane","days","anti-inflammatory effects","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","Therapeutic actions","prostaglandin E","addition","present study","Hypercytokinemia","CONCLUSION","FM","BALB","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Although originally proposed to have intracellular and extracellular functions, upon the discovery that perforin, in combination with GrB, could induce apoptosis, other potential functions for this protease were, for the most part, disregarded. As there are 5 granzymes in humans and 11 granzymes in mice, many studies used perforin knockout mice as an initial screen to evaluate the role of granzymes in disease. However, in recent years, emerging clinical and biochemical evidence has shown that the latter approach may have overlooked a critical perforin-independent, pathogenic role for these proteases in disease. This review focuses on GrB, the most characterized of the granzyme family, in disease. Long known to be a pro-apoptotic protease expressed by cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural killer cells, it is now accepted that GrB can be expressed in other cell types of immune and nonimmune origin. To the latter, an emerging immune-independent role for GrB has been forwarded due to recent discoveries that GrB may be expressed in nonimmune cells such as smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes, and chondrocytes in certain disease states. Given that GrB retains its activity in the blood, can cleave extracellular matrix, and its levels are often elevated in chronic inflammatory diseases, this protease may be an important contributor to certain pathologies. The implications of sustained elevations of intracellular and extracellular GrB in chronic vascular, dermatological, and neurological diseases, among others, are developing. This review examines, for the first time, the multiple roles of GrB in disease pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2009-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boivin, Wendy Anne; Cooper, Dawn Michelle; Hiebert, Paul Ryan; Granville, David James","journal":"Lab Invest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b203e6093b0b5a7aa7b4536d800927106c468be3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102238.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102238/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzM2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["extracellular GrB","multiple roles of GrB","nonimmune cells","role of granzymes","disease pathogenesis","certain disease states","cytotoxic lymphocytes","perforin pathway","extracellular functions","perforin knockout mice","critical perforin-independent","emerging immune-independent role","pathogenic role","smooth muscle cells","cytotoxic granzyme B","natural killer cells","extracellular matrix","review","pro-apoptotic protease","chronic inflammatory diseases","nonimmune origin","recent years","certain pathologies","neurological diseases","potential functions","granzyme family","recent discoveries","cell types of immune","implications of sustained elevations of intracellular","chondrocytes","keratinocytes","initial screen","biochemical evidence","studies","important contributor","levels","apoptosis","time","blood","discovery","combination","proteases","approach","humans","primary mechanism","activity"],"language":"en"},

Secondary necrosis involves activation of self-hydrolytic enzymes, and swelling of the cell or of the apoptotic bodies, generalized and irreparable damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, and culminates with cell disruption.

These mAbs were successfully used for detection and quantification of ACE by ELISA, Western blotting, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In all these applications mainly single mAbs were used. We hypothesized that we can obtain a completely new kind of information about ACE structure and function if we use the whole set of mAbs directed to different epitopes on the ACE molecule. When we finished epitope mapping of all mAbs to ACE (and especially, those recognizing conformational epitopes), we realized that we had obtained a new tool to study ACE. First, we demonstrated that binding of some mAbs is very sensitive to local conformational changes on the ACE surface\u2014due to local denaturation, inactivation, ACE inhibitor or mAbs binding or due to diseases. Second, we were able to detect, localize and characterize several human ACE mutations. And, finally, we established a new concept\u2014conformational fingerprinting of ACE using mAbs that in turn allowed us to obtain evidence for tissue specificity of ACE, which has promising scientific and diagnostic perspectives. The initial goal for the generation of mAbs to ACE 30 years ago was obtaining mAbs to organ-specific endothelial cells, which could be used for organ-specific drug delivery. Our systematic work on characterization of mAbs to numerous epitopes on ACE during these years has lead not only to the generation of the most effective mAbs for specific drug/gene delivery into the lung capillaries, but also to the establishment of the concept of conformational fingerprinting of ACE, which in turn gives a theoretical base for the generation of mAbs, specific for ACE from different organs. We believe that this concept could be applicable for any glycoprotein against which there is a set of mAbs to different epitopes.","publish_time":"2017-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Danilov, S.

In this study, we demonstrated that LPS activated the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibited lung fibroblast autophagy by depleting thymocyte differentiation antigen-1 (Thy-1) and upregulating integrin \u03B23 (Itgb3). Challenge of the human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cell line with LPS resulted in significant upregulation of integrin \u03B23, activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibition of autophagy, which could be abolished by integrin \u03B23 silencing by specific shRNA or treatment with the integrin \u03B23 inhibitor cilengitide. Meanwhile, LPS could inhibit Thy-1 expression accompanied with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation and lung fibroblast autophagy inhibition; these effects could be prevented by Thy-1 overexpression. Meanwhile, Thy-1 downregulation with Thy-1 shRNA could mimic the effects of LPS, inducing the activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and inhibiting lung fibroblast autophagy. Furthermore, protein immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that LPS reduced the binding of Thy-1 to integrin \u03B23. Thy-1 downregulation, integrin \u03B23 upregulation and autophagy inhibition were also detected in a mouse model of LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which could be prohibited by intratracheal injection of Thy-1 overexpressing adeno-associated virus (AAV) or intraperitoneal injection of the integrin \u03B23 inhibitor cilengitide.

In vitro and in vivo studies established that microRNAs (miRNAs) are decisive for endothelial cell gene expression and function in various pathological conditions associated with CVD. This review provides an overview of the miRNA role in controlling the key connections between endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. RECENT FINDINGS: Herein we summarize the present understanding of mechanisms underlying hypertension and its associated endothelial dysfunction as well as the miRNA role in endothelial cells with accent on the modulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, nitric oxide, oxidative stress and on the control of vascular inflammation and angiogenesis in relation to endothelial dysfunction in hypertension. In particular, latest insights in the identification of endothelial-specific microRNAs and their targets are added to the understanding of miRNA significance in hypertension. SUMMARY: This comprehensive knowledge of the role of miRNAs in endothelial dysfunction and hypertension and of molecular mechanisms proposed for miRNA actions may offer novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for controlling hypertension-associated endothelial dysfunction and other cardiovascular complications.","publish_time":"2016-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nemecz, Miruna; Alexandru, Nicoleta; Tanko, Gabriela; Georgescu, Adriana","journal":"Curr Hypertens Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecfec599d4b465666093270493a05ad6bd88957c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102349.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102349/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQxNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hypertension","associated endothelial dysfunction","identification of endothelial","endothelial cells","miRNA role","endothelial cell gene expression","miRNA actions","role of miRNAs","understanding of miRNA significance","CVD","present understanding of mechanisms","molecular mechanisms","therapeutic targets","cardiovascular disease","specific microRNAs","cardiovascular complications","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","system","major risk factor","novel diagnostic biomarkers","various pathological conditions","angiogenesis","accent","relation","oxidative stress","nitric oxide","angiotensin-aldosterone","key connections","modulation of renin","control of vascular inflammation","comprehensive knowledge","latest insights","cause","overview","consequence","SUMMARY","studies","RECENT FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

Although antibody secreting cells (ASC) within the inflamed CNS have been extensively examined, memory B cell (Bmem) characterization has been limited as they do not secrete antibody without stimulation. Moreover, unlike human Bmem, reliable surface markers for murine Bmem remain elusive. NEW METHOD: Using a viral encephalomyelitis model we developed a modified limiting dilution in vitro stimulation assay to convert CNS-derived virus specific Bmem into ASC. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Stimulation methods established for lymphoid tissue cells using prolonged stimulation with viral lysate resulted in substantial ASC loss and minimal Bmem to ASC conversion of CNS-derived cells. By varying stimulation duration, TLR activators, and culture supplements, we achieved optimal conversion by culturing cells with TLR7/8 agonist R848 in the presence of feeder cells for 2 days. RESULTS: Flow cytometry markers CD38 and CD73 characterizing murine Bmem from lymphoid tissue showed more diverse expression patterns on corresponding CNS-derived B cell subsets. Using the optimized TLR7/8 stimulation protocol, we compared virus-specific IgG Bmem versus pre-existing ASC within the brain and spinal cord. Increasing Bmem frequencies during chronic infection mirrored kinetics of ASC. However, despite initially similar Bmem and ASC accumulation, Bmem prevailed in the brain, but were lower than ASC in the spinal cord during persistence. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous enumeration of antigen-specific Bmem and ASC using the Bmem assay optimized for CNS-derived cells enables characterization of temporal changes during microbial or auto-antigen induced neuroinflammation.","publish_time":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"DiSano, Krista D.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.","journal":"Journal of Neuroscience Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/370fccf5a4e6e108db0581c8fe52665a8a66fa0e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5545894.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165027017301309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28495370/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027017301309; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.05.011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","ASC","IgG Bmem"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["murine Bmem","Bmem assay","minimal Bmem","Bmem frequencies","human Bmem","similar Bmem","ASC conversion of CNS","ASC accumulation","CNS-derived virus specific Bmem","CNS-derived cells","pre-existing ASC","virus-specific IgG Bmem","stimulation assay","Stimulation methods","substantial ASC loss","culturing cells","CNS inflammation","inflamed CNS","prolonged stimulation","stimulation protocol","lymphoid tissue cells","corresponding CNS-derived B cell subsets","antibody secreting cells","chronic infection mirrored kinetics of ASC","presence of feeder cells","varying stimulation duration","accumulation of diverse B cell subsets","memory B cell","brain","spinal cord","optimized TLR7","viral lysate","optimal conversion","EXISTING METHODS","reliable surface markers","diverse expression patterns","viral encephalomyelitis model","characterization of temporal changes","Simultaneous enumeration of antigen","Flow cytometry markers CD38","CD73","modified limiting dilution","TLR activators","agonist R848","culture supplements","injury","neurodegeneration","RESULTS","COMPARISON","NEW METHOD","CONCLUSION","days","BACKGROUND","persistence","neuroinflammation"],"language":"en"},

They develop in the bone marrow, emerge as either NK precursor cells, immature, or mature cells, and disperse throughout the body. In the periphery NK cells provide critical defense against pathogens and cancer and are noted to develop features of adaptive immune responses. In the tightly regulated and dynamic mucosal tissues, they set up residency via unknown mechanisms and from sources that are yet to be defined. Once resident, they appear to have the ability to functionally mature dependent on the mucosal tissue microenvironment. Mucosal NK cells play a pivotal role in early protection through their cytolytic function and IFN\u03B3 production against bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasitic infections. This review presents what is known about NK cell development and phenotypes of mucosal tissue resident conventional NK cells. The question of how they come to reside in their tissues and published data on their function against pathogens during mucosal infection are discussed. Dissecting major questions highlighted in this review will be important to the further understanding of NK cell homing and functional diversity and improve rational design of NK cell based therapies against mucosal infection.","publish_time":"2014-08-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ivanova, Daria; Krempels, Ryan; Ryfe, Jennyfer; Weitzman, Kaitlyn; Stephenson, David; Gigley, Jason P.","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8705d3a93c346b8b21e349c6263e680d844e7aea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4150440.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25197644/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/413982","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mucosal NK cells","NK precursor cells","periphery NK cells","mature cells","mucosal infection","NK cell development","phenotypes of mucosal tissue resident conventional NK cells","rational design of NK cell","understanding of NK cell homing","mucosal tissue microenvironment","dynamic mucosal tissues","Conventional natural killer cells","cancer","pathogens","review","cytolytic function","mature dependent","rapid responses","features of adaptive immune responses","functional diversity","pivotal role","continual surveillance","fungi","bacteria","IFN\u03B3 production","early protection","critical defense","therapies","viruses","residency","immature","published data","unknown mechanisms","sources","parasitic infections","bone marrow","major questions","ability","body"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetic network analysis of Ark isolates showed two predominant groups linked by 2 mutations, consistent with subpopulations found in commercial vaccines for this IBV type. In addition, a number of satellite groups surrounding the two predominant populations were observed for the Ark type virus, which is likely due to mutations associated with the nature of this vaccine to persist in flocks. The phylogenetic network analysis of Mass-type viruses shows two groupings corresponding to different manufacturers vaccine sequences. No satellite groups were observed for Mass-type viruses, which is consistent with no persistence of this vaccine type in the field. At the time of collection, no vaccine was being used for the DMV/1639 type viruses and phylogenetic network analysis showed a dispersed network suggesting no clear change in genetic distribution. Selection pressure analysis showed that the DMV/1639 and Mass-type strains were evolving under negative selection, whereas the Ark type viruses had evolved under positive selection.

Their tremendous diversity renders analysis of human viral communities (\u201Cviromes\u201D) to be highly complex. Because many of the viruses in humans are bacteriophage, their dynamic interactions with their cellular hosts add greatly to the complexities observed in examining human microbial ecosystems. We are only beginning to be able to study human viral communities on a large scale, mostly as a result of recent and continued advancements in sequencing and bioinformatic technologies. Bacteriophage community diversity in humans not only is inexorably linked to the diversity of their cellular hosts but also is due to their rapid evolution, horizontal gene transfers, and intimate interactions with host nucleic acids. There are vast numbers of observed viral genotypes on many body surfaces studied, including the oral, gastrointestinal, and respiratory tracts, and even in the human bloodstream, which previously was considered a purely sterile environment. The presence of viruses in blood suggests that virome members can traverse mucosal barriers, as indeed these communities are substantially altered when mucosal defenses are weakened. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of human viral communities is the extent to which they can carry gene functions involved in the pathogenesis of their hosts, particularly antibiotic resistance. Persons in close contact with each other have been shown to share a fraction of oral virobiota, which could potentially have important implications for the spread of antibiotic resistance to healthy individuals. Because viruses can have a large impact on ecosystem dynamics through mechanisms such as the transfers of beneficial gene functions or the lysis of certain populations of cellular hosts, they may have both beneficial and detrimental roles that affect human health, including improvements in microbial resilience to disturbances, immune evasion, maintenance of physiologic processes, and altering the microbial community in ways that promote or prevent pathogen colonization.","publish_time":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abeles, Shira R.; Pride, David T.","journal":"J Mol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49aeca6727e8e74c5a0fcdabe36db836c55d67d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172398.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25020228/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2014.07.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283614003301; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283614003301","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of human viral communities","human health","human microbiome","human bloodstream","human microbial ecosystems","interesting aspect of human viral communities","viral genotypes","microbial community","presence of viruses","Bacteriophage community diversity","transfers of beneficial gene functions","horizontal gene transfers","microbial resilience","lysis of certain populations of cellular hosts","humans","tremendous diversity","spread of antibiotic resistance","intimate interactions","dynamic interactions","large impact","large scale","mucosal barriers","mucosal defenses","fraction of oral virobiota","immune evasion","continued advancements","disturbances","mechanisms","maintenance of physiologic processes","sequencing","virome members","improvements","complexities","result of recent","ecosystem dynamics","host nucleic acids","genetic material","bioinformatic technologies","important implications","dependent biological entities","healthy individuals","ways","rapid evolution","body surfaces","detrimental roles","pathogenesis","viromes","extent","respiratory tracts","planet","cells","vast numbers","trillions","Persons","close contact","pathogen colonization","sterile environment"],"language":"en"},

This article aims to review the extent of civil society participation in China AIDS programmes over the past two decades. Methods A desk review was conducted to collect Chinese government policies, project documents and published articles on civil society participation of HIV/AIDS programmes in China over the past two decades. Assessment focused on five aspects: (i) the political environment; (ii) access to financial resources; (iii) the number of CSOs working on HIV/AIDS; (iv) the scope of work; and (v) the impact of CSO involvement on programmes. Results The number of CSOs specificly working on HIV/AIDS increased from 0 before 1988 to over 400 in 2009. Among a sample of 368 CSOs, 135 (36.7%) were registered. CSOs were primarily supported by international programmes. Government financial support to CSOs has increased from USD248 000 in 2002 to USD1.46 million in 2008. Initially, civil society played a minimal role. It is now widely involved in nearly all aspects of HIV/AIDS-related prevention, treatment and care efforts, and has had a positive impact; for example, increased adherence of anti-retroviral treatment and HIV testing among hard-to-reach groups. The main challenges faced by CSOs include registration, capacity and long-term financial support. Conclusion CSOs have significantly increased their participation and contribution to HIV/AIDS programmes in China. Policies for registration and financial support to CSOs need to be developed to enable them to play an even greater role in AIDS programmes.","publish_time":"2010-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Hui; Kuo, Nana Taona; Liu, Hui; Korhonen, Christine; Pond, Ellenie; Guo, Haoyan; Smith, Liz; Xue, Hui; Sun, Jiangping","journal":"Int J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26f94b094ce4d39665edddef1942f04dd041f363.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2992623.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyq223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21113039/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS","CSO","Conclusion CSOs"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["China AIDS programmes","number of CSOs","Conclusion CSOs","AIDS response","civil society participation of HIV","aspects of HIV","HIV testing","international programmes","AIDS-related prevention","civil society organizations","extent of civil society participation","Government financial support","long-term financial support","financial resources","registration","increased adherence of anti-retroviral treatment","decades","Chinese government policies","impact of CSO involvement","positive impact","minimal role","greater role","desk review","published articles","project documents","example","years","capacity","care efforts","access","contribution","main challenges","USD248","political environment","Methods","Background","scope of work","USD1","groups","Assessment","sample"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of this paper were 1) to simulate the inanition of poult enteritis mortality syndrome by restricting feed intake and 2) to develop a drinking water supplement that supports the immune functions of poults with inanition. Poults were restricted to 14 g of feed/d for 7 d beginning at 14 d of age then fed ad libitum until 36 d (recovery). The control was fed ad libitum. During the feed-restriction period, duplicate groups of 6 poults received 1 of 5 drinking water treatments: 1) restricted feed, unsupplemented water; 2) restricted feed \u002B electrolytes (RE); 3) RE \u002B glucose \u002B citric acid (REGC); 4) REGC \u002B betaine (REGCB); or 5) REGCB \u002B zinc-methionine (REGCBZ). Immunological functions were assessed by inoculating poults with SRBC and B. abortus (BA) antigen at 15, 22, and 29 d of age. Antibody (Ab) titers were determined 7 d later for primary, secondary, and recovery responses. The primary and secondary total Ab titers to SRBC for restricted feed were 4.71 and 6.16 log3, which where lower (P \u003C 0.05) than for controls (8.00 and 9.66 log3) and the other treatments. The recovery Ab titer for controls was 10.7, significantly higher than restricted feed (8.71) and RE (8.10) groups but not different from other treatments. The primary total Ab responses to BA were significantly lower in the restricted feed and RE groups as compared with the control and other treatments. Although feed restriction of poults to maintenance reduces the humoral immune responses, these responses can be significantly improved by drinking water containing electrolytes and especially sources of energy such as glucose and citric acid.","publish_time":"2004-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Hadri, L.; Garlich, J.

To assist frontline healthcare providers with detecting potential cases and initiating critical actions, investigators modified the \u201CIdentify-Isolate-Inform\u201D tool for mumps infection. The tool is applicable to regions with rare incidences or local outbreaks, especially seen in college students, as well as globally in areas where vaccination is less common. Mumps begins with a prodrome of low-grade fever, myalgias and malaise/anorexia, followed by development of nonsuppurative parotitis, which is the pathognomonic finding associated with acute mumps infection. Orchitis and meningitis are the two most common serious complications, with hearing loss and infertility occurring rarely. Providers should consider mumps in patients with exposure to a known case or international travel to endemic regions who present with consistent signs and symptoms. If mumps is suspected, healthcare providers must immediately implement standard and droplet precautions and notify the local health department and hospital infection control personnel.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koenig, Kristi L.; Shastry, Siri; Mzahim, Bandr; Almadhyan, Abdulmajeed; Burns, Michael J.","journal":"West J Emerg Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b7e0cb6554d2f871d6b09daa0b5505472873a20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5017829.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2016.6.30793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27625709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of mumps","mumps-rubella","acute mumps infection","local outbreaks","contagious viral infection","frontline healthcare providers","tool","hospital infection control personnel","endemic regions","rare incidences","known case","local health department","common serious complications","potential cases","international travel","introduction of measles","pathognomonic finding","anorexia","malaise","myalgias","hearing loss","droplet precautions","exposure","patients","prodrome of low-grade fever","industrialized countries","investigators","development of nonsuppurative parotitis","critical actions","consistent signs","MMR","standard","infertility","meningitis","vaccine","Isolate","college students","symptoms","areas","vaccination","past decade","Orchitis","clinicians","disease"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Across a large number of comparisons, aspirin was superior to placebo in treating pain, cold or fever. Efficacy was essentially similar to that of comparators used in equivalent doses. There was no serious GI adverse event attributed to ASA in any study, but mild-to-moderate dyspepsia in small percentages of cases was commonly reported. CONCLUSION: OTC aspirin is safe and effective.

CFPHV has also been detected recently by PCR in tissue samples from clinically healthy (non exhibiting fibropapilloma tumours) turtles, thus representing presumably latent infections of the pathogen. Given that template copy numbers of viruses in latent infections can be very low, extremely sensitive PCR assays are needed to optimize detection efficiency. In this study, efficiency of several PCR assays designed for CFPHV detection is explored and compared to a method published previously. The results show that adoption of a triplet set of singleplex PCR assays outperforms other methods, with an approximately 3-fold increase in detection success in comparison to the standard assay. Thus, a new assay for the detection of CFPHV DNA markers is presented, and adoption of its methodology is recommended in future CFPHV screens among sea turtles.","publish_time":"2014-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alfaro-N\u00FA\u00F1ez, Alonzo; Gilbert, M.

OBJECTIVE: To identify disparities in disaster preparedness among US households. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data from a nationally representative sample of US households from the 2017 American Housing Survey\u2019s topical section on preparedness to assess associations of disaster preparedness with households\u2019 socioeconomic characteristics, composition, and region. Logistic regressions were used to assess associations of household characteristics with overall preparedness, resource- and action-based preparedness, and specific preparedness items. Data analyses were completed on March 27, 2020. EXPOSURES: Combined household income, head of household\u2019s education level, race/ethnicity, marital status of head of household, head of household aged 65 years or older, presence of children or a household member with a disability, and region. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Nine actionable preparedness items, such as having an emergency carry-on kit (resource), food and water stockpiles (resource), and alternative communication plans and meeting locations (action). Items were summed for the measures of overall, resource-based, and action-based preparedness, with preparedness defined as meeting at least half of the criteria. RESULTS: Among 16 725 included households, 9103 household heads were men (54.4%), 11 687 were married (69.9%), and 10 749 (66.1%) had some college education or higher. In all, 1969 household heads (11.8%) were black, while 2696 were Hispanic/Latino (16.1%); 3579 household heads (21.4%) were 65 years or older. A total of 7163 households (42.8%) included children, and 3533 households (21.2%) included a person with a disability. Households were more likely to fulfill at least half of the criteria for resource-based preparedness (10 950 households [65.5%]) than for action-based preparedness (6876 households [41.1%]). Wealthy households and those with household heads aged 65 years or older were more likely to fulfill at least half of resource-based items (wealthy households: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] by logged income, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.13-1.22]; household heads age \u226565 years: aOR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.29-1.55) but less likely to fulfill action-based items (wealthy households: aOR: 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.99]; household heads age \u226565 years: aOR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84-0.99]). Households with black household heads were more likely to fulfill items directly related to emergencies (carry-on emergency kit: aOR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.14-1.39]; alternative communication plan: aOR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.39-1.72]; alternative meeting location: aOR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.07-1.31]) but less likely to fulfill resource-based items (at least half of resource items: aOR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.80-0.99]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that types of preparedness vary by household characteristics. Targeted strategies are needed to promote preparedness across communities.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zamboni, Lucila M.; Martin, Erika G.","journal":"JAMA Netw Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/12085a1cb12d08c6c7d4b5573ba6cdb4717d2957.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186859.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.6881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32338755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["household disaster preparedness","resource-based preparedness","action-based preparedness","overall preparedness","types of preparedness","actionable preparedness items","specific preparedness items","aOR","resource-based items","household heads age","black household heads","household member","Wealthy households","included households","action-based items","associations of disaster preparedness","half of resource items","associations of household characteristics","Combined household income","years","representative sample of US households","alternative meeting location","alternative communication plans","US government","meeting locations","emergency carry-on kit","carry-on emergency kit","MEASURES","criteria","region","disability","head of household\u2019s education level","marital status of head","households\u2019 socioeconomic characteristics","logged income","presence of children","college education","Data analyses","race","ethnicity","adjusted odds ratio","American Housing Survey\u2019s topical section","food","PARTICIPANTS","composition","emergencies","disparities","water stockpiles","cross-sectional study","findings","EXPOSURES","MAIN OUTCOMES","SETTING","RELEVANCE","terrorist attacks","IMPORTANCE","CONCLUSIONS","DESIGN","Logistic regressions","OBJECTIVE","Targeted strategies","RESULTS","Latino","person","total","communities"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the sputum cellular, mediator, and microbiome profiles of both asthma and COPD exacerbations. METHODS: Patients with severe asthma or moderate-to-severe COPD were recruited prospectively to a single center. Sputum mediators were available in 32 asthmatic patients and 73 patients with COPD assessed at exacerbation. Biologic clusters were determined by using factor and cluster analyses on a panel of sputum mediators. Patterns of clinical parameters, sputum mediators, and microbiome communities were assessed across the identified clusters. RESULTS: The asthmatic patients and patients with COPD had different clinical characteristics and inflammatory profiles but similar microbial ecology. Three exacerbation biologic clusters were identified. Cluster 1 was COPD predominant, with 27 patients with COPD and 7 asthmatic patients exhibiting increased blood and sputum neutrophil counts, proinflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-6 receptor, TNF-\u03B1, TNF receptors 1 and 2, and vascular endothelial growth factor), and proportions of the bacterial phylum Proteobacteria. Cluster 2 had 10 asthmatic patients and 17 patients with COPD with increased blood and sputum eosinophil counts, type 2 mediators (IL-5, IL-13, CCL13, CCL17, and CCL26), and proportions of the bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes. Cluster 3 had 15 asthmatic patients and 29 patients with COPD with increased type 1 mediators (CXCL10, CXCL11, and IFN-\u03B3) and proportions of the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. CONCLUSIONS: A biologic clustering approach revealed 3 subgroups of asthma and COPD exacerbations, each with different percentages of patients with overlapping asthma and COPD. The sputum mediator and microbiome profiles were distinct between clusters.","publish_time":"2018-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ghebre, Michael A.; Pang, Pee Hwee; Diver, Sarah; Desai, Dhananjay; Bafadhel, Mona; Haldar, Koirobi; Kebadze, Tatiana; Cohen, Suzanne; Newbold, Paul; Rapley, Laura; Woods, Joanne; Rugman, Paul; Pavord, Ian D.; Johnston, Sebastian L.; Barer, Michael; May, Richard D.; Brightling, Christopher E.","journal":"J Allergy Clin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36b70bcdd81d0088172f9acd042b27b67fd6d1ac.json; document_parses/pdf_json/131bd567befa85f74a01b837c52d475cdd62aa38.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5986707.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674918306250; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2018.04.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29709671/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674918306250","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","TNF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthmatic patients","COPD exacerbations","severe COPD","COPD predominant","different percentages of patients","panel of sputum mediators","sputum cellular","Exacerbations of asthma","proinflammatory mediators","severe asthma","sputum neutrophil counts","sputum eosinophil counts","microbiome profiles","subgroups of asthma","proportions","overlapping asthma","exacerbation biologic clusters","identified clusters","increased blood","increased type","cluster analyses","inflammatory profiles","microbiome communities","different clinical characteristics","biologic clustering approach","bacterial phylum Proteobacteria","bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes","TNF receptors","TNF-\u03B1","Patterns of clinical parameters","vascular endothelial growth factor","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","similar microbial ecology","CXCL11","CXCL10","IFN-\u03B3","phyla Actinobacteria","CCL26","Firmicutes","CONCLUSIONS","CCL13","CCL17","BACKGROUND","METHODS","RESULTS","single center","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Remarkably, many of the aptamers selected against biologically relevant protein targets are G-rich sequences that can fold into stable G-quadruplex (G4) structures. Aiming at disseminating novel inspiring ideas within the scientific community in the field of G4-structures, the emphasis of this review is placed on: 1) recent advancements in SELEX technology for the efficient and rapid identification of new candidate aptamers (introduction of microfluidic systems and next generation sequencing); 2) recurrence of G4 structures in aptamers selected by SELEX against biologically relevant protein targets; 3) discovery of several G4-forming motifs in important regulatory regions of the human or viral genome bound by endogenous proteins, which per se can result into potential aptamers; 4) an updated overview of G4-based aptamers with therapeutic potential and 5) a discussion on the most attractive G4-based aptamers for diagnostic applications.

The currently used live-attenuated vaccines have the tendency to mutate and/or recombine with circulating field strains resulting in the emergence of vaccine-derived variant viruses. In order to circumvent these issues, and to develop a vaccine that is more relevant to Egypt and its neighboring countries, a recombinant avirulent Newcastle disease virus (rNDV) strain LaSota was constructed to express the codon-optimized S glycoprotein of the Egyptian IBV variant strain IBV/Ck/EG/CU/4/2014 belonging to GI-23 lineage, that is prevalent in Egypt and in the Middle East. A wild type and two modified versions of the IBV S protein were expressed individually by rNDV. A high level of S protein expression was detected in vitro by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. All rNDV-vectored IBV vaccine candidates were genetically stable, slightly attenuated and showed growth patterns comparable to that of parental rLaSota virus. Single-dose vaccination of 1-day-old SPF White Leghorn chicks with the rNDVs expressing IBV S protein provided significant protection against clinical disease after IBV challenge but did not show reduction in tracheal viral shedding. Single-dose vaccination also provided complete protection against virulent NDV challenge. However, prime-boost vaccination using rNDV expressing the wild type IBV S protein provided better protection, after IBV challenge, against clinical signs and significantly reduced tracheal viral shedding. These results indicate that the NDV-vectored IBV vaccines are promising bivalent vaccine candidates to control both infectious bronchitis and Newcastle disease in Egypt.

RNase L is activated by viral infection and dsRNA. Because the role of swine RNase L (sRNase L) is not fully understood, in this study, we generated a sRNase L knockout PK-15 (KO-PK) cell line through the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to evaluate the function of sRNase L. After transfection with CRISPR-Cas9 followed by selection using puromycin, sRNase L knockout in PK-15 cells was further validated by agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA sequencing, and Western blotting. The sRNase L KO-PK cells failed to trigger RNA degradation and induced less apoptosis than the parental PK-15 cells after transfected with poly (I: C). Furthermore, the levels of ISGs mRNA in sRNase L KO-PK cells were higher than those in the parental PK-15 cells after treated with poly (I: C). Finally, both wild type and attenuated pseudorabies viruses (PRV) replicated more efficiently in sRNase L KO-PK cells than the parental PK-15 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that sRNase L has multiple biological functions including cellular single-stranded RNA degradation, induction of apoptosis, downregulation of transcript levels of ISGs, and antiviral activity against PRV. The sRNase L KO-PK cell line will be a valuable tool for studying functions of sRNase L as well as for producing PRV attenuated vaccine.","publish_time":"2019-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sui, Chao; Jiang, Dandan; Wu, Xiangju; Cong, Xiaoyan; Li, Feng; Shang, Yingli; Wang, Jinqiu; Liu, Sidang; Shan, Hu; Qi, Jing; Du, Yijun","journal":"Biomed Res Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95d1135211f245b882e54f2842ab328b89066452.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6421005.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941371/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/7398208","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRISPR/Cas9","PRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["KO-PK cells","parental PK","knockout PK","functions of sRNase","function of sRNase","KO-PK cell line","CRISPR-Cas9","PRV attenuated vaccine","poly","levels of ISGs mRNA","role of swine RNase","induction of apoptosis","downregulation of transcript levels of ISGs","antiviral activity","wild type","cellular single-stranded RNA degradation","multiple biological functions","attenuated pseudorabies viruses","important antiviral endoribonuclease","Cas9 gene editing system","DNA sequencing","valuable tool","agarose gel electrophoresis","selection","puromycin","transfection","Western blotting","viral infection","dsRNA","IFN","findings","study"],"language":"en"},

Other posttranslational modifications of HSV1 glycoproteins (designated gB, gC, gD and gE) were related temporally to the discrete shifts in electrophoretic mobilities that signal acquisition of the O-linked oligosaccharides. Fatty acid acylation (principally of gE) could be detected just prior to the shifts, whereas conversion of high-mannosetype N-linked oligosaccharides to the complex type occurred coincident with the shifts. The addition of O-linked oligosaccharides did not occur in cells treated with the ionophore monensin or in a ricinresistant cell line defective in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides. We conclude that extension of O-linked oligosaccharide chains on HSV1 glycoproteins, and probably also attachment of the first O-linked sugars, occurs as a late posttranslational modification in the Golgi apparatus.","publish_time":"1983-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, David C.; Spear, Patricia G.","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/507ca6291af719a7d32dab7474ff70d0036c4925.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867483900831; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0092867483900831","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["O-linked oligosaccharides","O-linked sugars","mannosetype N-linked oligosaccharides","linked oligosaccharide chains","extension of O","addition of O","mobilities of immature forms","posttranslational modifications of HSV1 glycoproteins","forms relative","lower electrophoretic mobilities","gE","discrete shifts","mature forms of herpes simplex virus type","processing of N","complex type","late posttranslational modification","designated gB","gC","ricinresistant cell line defective","acquisition","conversion of high","ionophore monensin","Golgi apparatus","gD","cells","attachment","Fatty acid acylation"],"language":"en"},

We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize existing evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of LUS for pneumonia in adults. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of published studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of LUS against a referent CXR or chest CT scan and/or clinical criteria for pneumonia in adults aged \u226518 years. Eligible studies were required to have a CXR and/or chest CT scan at the time of evaluation. We manually extracted descriptive and quantitative information from eligible studies, and calculated pooled sensitivity and specificity using the Mantel-Haenszel method and pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR) using the DerSimonian-Laird method. We assessed for heterogeneity using the Q and I(2) statistics. RESULTS: Our initial search strategy yielded 2726 articles, of which 45 (1.7%) were manually selected for review and 10 (0.4%) were eligible for analyses. These 10 studies provided a combined sample size of 1172 participants. Six studies enrolled adult patients who were either hospitalized or admitted to Emergency Departments with suspicion of pneumonia and 4 studies enrolled critically-ill adult patients. LUS was performed by highly-skilled sonographers in seven studies, by trained physicians in two, and one did not mention level of training. All studies were conducted in high-income settings. LUS took a maximum of 13 minutes to conduct. Nine studies used a 3.5-5 MHz micro-convex transducer and one used a 5\u20139 MHz convex probe. Pooled sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pneumonia using LUS were 94% (95% CI, 92%-96%) and 96% (94%-97%), respectively; pooled positive and negative LRs were 16.8 (7.7-37.0) and 0.07 (0.05-0.10), respectively; and, the area-under-the-ROC curve was 0.99 (0.98-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis supports that LUS, when conducted by highly-skilled sonographers, performs well for the diagnosis of pneumonia. General practitioners and Emergency Medicine physicians should be encouraged to learn LUS since it appears to be an established diagnostic tool in the hands of experienced physicians.","publish_time":"2014-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chavez, Miguel A; Shams, Navid; Ellington, Laura E; Naithani, Neha; Gilman, Robert H; Steinhoff, Mark C; Santosham, Mathuram; Black, Robert E; Price, Carrie; Gross, Margaret; Checkley, William","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e5c4cfb4582c7aa5e60455ae948554981054c47.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4005846.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-15-50; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24758612/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3NDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LUS","Emergency Medicine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Eligible studies","diagnosis of pneumonia","diagnostic accuracy of LUS","suspicion of pneumonia","chest CT scan","systematic search of published studies","pooled sensitivity","chest X-ray","referent CXR","chest computerized tomography","specificity","Emergency Medicine physicians","adults","trained physicians","meta-analysis","skilled sonographers","established diagnostic tool","hands of experienced physicians","ill adult patients","negative LRs","Emergency Departments","convex probe","negative likelihood ratios","Mantel-Haenszel method","initial search strategy","DerSimonian-Laird method","micro-convex transducer","existing evidence","clinical criteria","alternative","General practitioners","combined sample size","quantitative information","use of lung ultrasound","time of evaluation","area-under-","ROC curve","participants","RESULTS","articles","Guidelines","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","maximum","minutes","high-income settings","years","level of training","heterogeneity","statistics","BACKGROUND","analyses","review"],"language":"en"},

However, IFNs are species-specific and antibodies have been shown to develop in response to the high rHuIFN-\u03B1 doses necessary for an effective therapy. A recombinant feline IFN has been developed, which has been characterized as interferon-omega (rFeIFN-\u03C9), designed to overcome these problems. Nonetheless, very few studies have been undertaken to evaluate its efficacy in cats naturally infected with FIV or FeLV. In an initial study, we here demonstrated that rFeIFN-\u03C9 can dramatically improve the clinical condition of infected cats, and induce improvement of hematologic parameters. Minor changes or no change was observed for hypergammaglobulinemia, CD4/CD8 ratio, proviral load, viremia and RT activity, suggesting that the overall effect of IFN was on innate immunity.

Electronic medical record (EMR) use for contact tracing is time-consuming and may miss exposed individuals. Real-time location systems (RTLSs) may improve contact identification. Therefore, the relative effectiveness of these 2 contact tracing methodologies were evaluated. Methods During a pertussis outbreak in the United States, a retrospective case study was conducted between June 14 and August 31, 2016, to identify the contacts of confirmed pertussis cases, using EMR and RTLS data in the emergency department of a tertiary care medical center. Descriptive statistics and a paired t test (\u03B1 = 0.05) were performed to compare contacts identified by EMR versus RTLS, as was correlation between pertussis patient length of stay and the number of potential contacts. Results Nine cases of pertussis presented to the emergency department during the identified time period. RTLS doubled the potential exposure list (P \u003C .01). Length of stay had significant positive correlation with contacts identified by RTLS (\u03C1 = 0.79; P = .01) but not with EMR (\u03C1 = 0.43; P = .25). Conclusions RTLS doubled the potential pertussis exposures beyond EMR-based contact identification. Thus, RTLS may be a valuable addition to the practice of contact tracing and infectious disease monitoring.","publish_time":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hellmich, Thomas R.; Clements, Casey M.; El-Sherif, Nibras; Pasupathy, Kalyan S.; Nestler, David M.; Boggust, Andy; Ernste, Vickie K.; Marisamy, Gomathi; Koenig, Kyle R.; Hallbeck, M.

However, not all are equals in terms of access to networks or connected devices, or when it comes to the skills required to navigate computerized spaces optimally. Digital inequalities were already existing, yet the COVID-19 crisis is exacerbating them dramatically. On the one hand, the crisis will worsen digital inequalities within the population. On the other hand, digital inequalities represent a major risk factor of vulnerability for exposure to the virus itself, and for the non-sanitary consequences of the crisis. Therefore, this paper aims at exploring the reciprocal impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and digital inequalities, and to propose operative solutions to help fight the nefarious consequences of the crisis. We first describe how digital inequalities are a determinant of health. We then investigate how COVID-19 can potentiate digital inequalities, and how digital inequalities potentiate vulnerability to COVID-19.

The Phyllanthus extract has anti-HBV activity; however, its antiviral activity against lamivudine (LMV)-resistant mutants has not been examined. METHODS: HBV harboring LMV-resistant mutations (rtM204I, rtM204V, and rtM204S) in the P gene at the YMDD ((203)tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate(206)) reverse transcriptase (RT) active site were generated and their sensitivity to Phyllanthus urinaria koreanis extract examined. Southern blotting and real-time PCR were used to determine the concentration of plant extract required to inhibit HBV DNA synthesis by 50 and 90 % (EC(50) and EC(90), respectively). An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the EC(50) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV core antigen (HBcAg) secretion, and the 50 % cytotoxic concentration of the extract was measured in a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Real-time RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA expression levels. RESULTS: The expression of intracellular HBV DNAs in HBV WT- or mutant-transfected HepG2 cells decreased upon treatment with Phyllanthus extract. The secretion of HBsAg and HBcAg also fell in a dose-dependent manner. Phyllanthus extract induced interferon-beta (IFN-\u03B2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA expression in HBV WT-transfected HepG2 cells, possibly via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and c-jun N-terminal kinases and the induction of retinoic acid inducible gene-I, toll-like receptor 3, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, and/or tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 gene expression. HBV transfection in the absence of extract or exposure of cells to extract alone did not trigger these signaling cascades. CONCLUSIONS: Phyllanthus extract inhibited HBV DNA synthesis and HBsAg and HBcAg secretion by replicating cells harboring HBV wild-type and LMV-resistant mutants, likely by inducing the expression of IFN-\u03B2, COX-2, and IL-6. These data indicate that Phyllanthus extract may be useful as an alternative therapeutic agent for the treatment of drug-resistant CHB patients.

Numerous mutations have been identified in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different SARS-CoV strains isolated from humans or civets. Why these mutations were naturally selected or how SARS-CoV evolved to adapt to different host receptors has been poorly understood, presenting evolutionary and epidemic conundrums. In this study, we investigated the impact of these mutations on receptor recognition, an important determinant of SARS-CoV infection and pathogenesis. Using a combination of biochemical, functional, and crystallographic approaches, we elucidated the molecular and structural mechanisms of each of these naturally selected RBD mutations. These mutations either strengthen favorable interactions or reduce unfavorable interactions with two virus-binding hot spots on ACE2, and by doing so, they enhance viral interactions with either human (hACE2) or civet (cACE2) ACE2. Therefore, these mutations were viral adaptations to either hACE2 or cACE2. To corroborate the above analysis, we designed and characterized two optimized RBDs. The human-optimized RBD contains all of the hACE2-adapted residues (Phe-442, Phe-472, Asn-479, Asp-480, and Thr-487) and possesses exceptionally high affinity for hACE2 but relative low affinity for cACE2. The civet-optimized RBD contains all of the cACE2-adapted residues (Tyr-442, Pro-472, Arg-479, Gly-480, and Thr-487) and possesses exceptionally high affinity for cACE2 and also substantial affinity for hACE2. These results not only illustrate the detailed mechanisms of host receptor adaptation by SARS-CoV but also provide a molecular and structural basis for tracking future SARS-CoV evolution in animals.","publish_time":"2012-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Kailang; Peng, Guiqing; Wilken, Matthew; Geraghty, Robert J.; Li, Fang","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/40cc46308306c6de90805595358f3ed1a027212f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3308800.xml.json","url":"http://www.jbc.org/content/287/12/8904.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22291007/; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m111.325803","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["binding affinity","selected RBD mutations","different SARS-CoV strains","future SARS-CoV evolution","CoV infection","high affinity","Numerous mutations","human-optimized RBD","substantial affinity","hACE2-adapted residues","cACE2-adapted residues","civet-optimized RBD","important determinant of SARS","human receptor angiotensin","receptor-binding domain","receptor recognition","viral interactions","relative low affinity","detailed mechanisms of host receptor adaptation","unfavorable interactions","humans","structural mechanisms","Phe","optimized RBDs","Thr","different host receptors","structural basis","palm civets","viral adaptations","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","crystallographic approaches","capacity","Tyr","impact","animals","enzyme","hot spots","combination of biochemical","pathogenesis","epidemic conundrums","Arg","Gly","Asp","Asn","results","study","analysis"],"language":"en"},

Limited data are available in China to describe the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections, especially in small\u2013medium cities and rural areas. OBJECTIVES: To determine the viral etiology and seasonality of acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children, a 3-year study was conducted in Shenzhen, China. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates from eligible children were collected. Influenza and other respiratory viruses were tested by molecular assays simultaneously. Data were analyzed to describe the frequency and seasonality. RESULTS: Of the 2025 children enrolled in the study, 971 (48\u00B70%) were positive for at least one viral pathogen, in which 890 (91\u00B77%) were \u003C4 years of age. The three most prevalent viruses were influenza A (IAV; 35\u00B78%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 30\u00B75%) and human rhinovirus (HRV; 21\u00B75%). Co-infections were found in 302 cases (31\u00B71%), and dual viral infection was dominant. RSV, HRV and IAV were the most frequent viral agents involved in co-infection. On the whole, the obvious seasonal peaks mainly from March to May were observed with peak strength varying from 1 year to another. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a basic profile of the epidemiology of acute respiratory viral infection in hospitalized children in Shenzhen. The spectrum of viruses in the study site is similar to that in other places, but the seasonality is closely related to geographic position, different from that in big cities in northern China and neighboring Hong Kong.","publish_time":"2014-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"He, Ying; Lin, Guang-Yu; Wang, Qiong; Cai, Xiao-Ying; Zhang, Yin-Hui; Lin, Chuang-Xing; Lu, Chang-Dong; Lu, Xue-Dong","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef5fe7296ec8baf90d974cf5737af0da3ed403ea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4181804.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828783/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12257","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["epidemiology of viral respiratory infections","viral etiology","respiratory viruses","viral pathogen","epidemiology of acute respiratory viral infection","management of viral respiratory tract infections","dual viral infection","seasonality of acute respiratory infections","frequent viral agents","epidemiology of local viral etiologies","hospitalized children","Co-infections","year study","respiratory syncytial virus","eligible children","study site","northern China","IAV","spectrum of viruses","prevalent viruses","Shenzhen","RSV","HRV","Influenza","big cities","medium cities","Limited data","neighboring Hong Kong","basic profile","rural areas","METHODS","Nasopharyngeal aspirates","geographic position","molecular assays","BACKGROUND","human rhinovirus","obvious seasonal peaks","peak strength","places","CONCLUSIONS","frequency","OBJECTIVES","cases","years of age","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Peptide vaccines are an attractive alternative strategy that relies on usage of short peptide fragments to engineer the induction of highly targeted immune responses, consequently avoiding allergenic and/or reactogenic sequences. Conversely, peptide vaccines used in isolation are often weakly immunogenic and require particulate carriers for delivery and adjuvanting.

The PRV genome is large and difficult to manipulate, but it is feasible to use clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology. However, identification of single guide RNA (sgRNA) through screening is critical to the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and is traditionally time and labor intensive, and not suitable for rapid and high throughput screening of effective PRV sgRNAs. In this study, we developed a recombinant PRV strain expressing firefly luciferase and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter virus for PRV-specific sgRNA screens and rapid evaluation of antiviral compounds. Luciferase activity was apparent as soon as 4 h after infection and was stably expressed through 10 passages. In a proof of the principle screen, we were able to identify several PRV specific sgRNAs and confirmed that they inhibited PRV replication using traditional methods. Using the reporter virus, we also identified PRV variants lacking US3, US2, and US9 gene function, and showed anti-PRV activity for chloroquine. Our results suggest that the reporter PRV strain will be a useful tool for basic virology studies, and for developing PRV control and prevention measures.","publish_time":"2016-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Yan-Dong; Liu, Ji-Ting; Fang, Qiong-Qiong; Wang, Tong-Yun; Sun, Ming-Xia; An, Tong-Qing; Tian, Zhi-Jun; Cai, Xue-Hui","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5dd71c3b90ad6f642495062f9f591f78fccd8d75.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4848585.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27043610/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v8040090","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["PRV control","PRV variants","PRV genome","PRV replication","reporter PRV strain","PRV specific sgRNAs","recombinant PRV strain","anti-PRV activity","PRV-specific sgRNA screens","high throughput screening of effective PRV sgRNAs","reporter virus","CRISPR","Luciferase activity","Pseudorabies virus","firefly luciferase","Cas9 system","Cas9 technology","rapid evaluation of antiviral compounds","useful tool","interspaced short palindromic repeats","US2","green fluorescent protein","US9 gene function","basic virology studies","US3","EGFP","identification of single guide RNA","time","labor intensive","principle screen","traditional methods","prevention measures","chloroquine","results","proof","China","study","commercial vaccines","infection","passages"],"language":"en"},

A commercial TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR assay has been widely used for the differential detection of EV71 despite its relatively high cost and failure to detect samples with a low viral load (Ct value \u003E 35). In this study, a highly sensitive real-time nested RT-PCR (RTN RT-PCR) assay in a single closed tube for detection of EV71 in HFMD was developed. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay were evaluated using a reference EV71 stock and a panel of controls consisting of coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and common respiratory viruses, respectively. The clinical performance of this assay was evaluated and compared with those of a commercial TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay and a traditional two-step nested RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection for the RTN RT-PCR assay was 0.01 TCID(50)/ml, with a Ct value of 38.3, which was the same as that of the traditional two-step nested RT-PCR assay and approximately tenfold lower than that of the qRT-PCR assay. When testing the reference strain EV71, this assay showed favorable detection reproducibility and no obvious cross-reactivity. The testing results of 100 clinical throat swabs from HFMD-suspected patients revealed that 41 samples were positive for EV71 by both RTN RT-PCR and traditional two-step nested RT-PCR assays, whereas only 29 were EV71 positive by qRT-PCR assay.

Research method: 110 nurses recruited from the OAG unit of a large Hong Kong public hospital completed a structured questionnaire. Outcome measures: Attitudes towards perinatal bereavement support; required support and training needs for nurses on bereavement care. Results: Two-step cluster analysis yielded two clusters. Cluster A consisted of 55.5% (n=61) and cluster B consisted of 44.5% (n=49) of nurses. Cluster A nurses were younger, had less OAG experience, more junior ranking and less education than cluster B nurses. Cluster B nurses had additional midwifery and bereavement care training, personal grieving experiences and experience handling grieving clients. The majority held positive bereavement care attitudes. Significant differences towards perinatal bereavement support were found. Only 25.5% (n=28) had bereavement related training. Attitudes towards bereavement care were positively correlated with training needs (r s=0.59) and hospital policy support (r s=0.60). Conclusion: Hong Kong nurses emphasized need for increased bereavement care knowledge and experience, improved communication skills, and greater hospital and team members\u0027 support.

Our results suggest that higher cumulative doses and longer treatment durations of steroids are more likely to lead to the development of osteonecrosis in SARS patients. INTRODUCTION: The link between steroid treatment and the risk of osteonecrosis in SARS patients remains unknown. The present meta-analysis aimed to examine the dose-response association between steroid therapy and osteonecrosis incidence in SARS patients. The sex differences in the development of steroid-induced osteonecrosis were also examined. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI, and WANFANG for studies that involved steroid therapy and reported osteonecrosis data in SARS patients. Two authors independently extracted the data from the individual studies, and the rate ratio (RR) of osteonecrosis was calculated using random-effect models. RESULTS: Ten studies with 1137 recovered SARS patients met the inclusion criteria. Close relationships between osteonecrosis incidence and both the cumulative dose and treatment duration of steroids were observed. The summary RR of osteonecrosis was 1.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30\u20131.89, p \u003C 0.001) per 5.0 g increase in the cumulative dose of steroids and was 1.29 (95% CI 1.09\u20131.53, p = 0.003) for each 10-day increment of increase in treatment duration. The relationship was non-linear (p (non-linear) \u003C 0.001 and p (non-linear) = 0.022). There were no significant differences in the risk of developing osteonecrosis between the male and female patients (RR 0.01, 95% CI \u22120.03 to 0.06, p = 0.582). CONCLUSIONS: SARS patients who received higher cumulative doses and longer treatment durations of steroids were more likely to develop osteonecrosis, and there were no sex differences in this dose-dependent side effect. Our findings suggest that it is important to reduce osteonecrosis risk by modifying the cumulative dose and the treatment duration of steroids in SARS patients.

However, the role of other post-translational modifications, such as ADP-ribosylation, in host-virus interactions is less well characterized. ADP-ribosylation is carried out by proteins encoded by the PARP (also called ARTD) gene family. The majority of the 17 human PARP genes are poorly characterized. However, one PARP protein, PARP13/ZAP, has broad antiviral activity and has evolved under positive (diversifying) selection in primates. Such evolution is typical of domains that are locked in antagonistic \u2018arms races\u2019 with viral factors. To identify additional PARP genes that may be involved in host-virus interactions, we performed evolutionary analyses on all primate PARP genes to search for signatures of rapid evolution. Contrary to expectations that most PARP genes are involved in \u2018housekeeping\u2019 functions, we found that nearly one-third of PARP genes are evolving under strong recurrent positive selection. We identified a \u003E300 amino acid disordered region of PARP4, a component of cytoplasmic vault structures, to be rapidly evolving in several mammalian lineages, suggesting this region serves as an important host-pathogen specificity interface. We also found positive selection of PARP9, 14 and 15, the only three human genes that contain both PARP domains and macrodomains. Macrodomains uniquely recognize, and in some cases can reverse, protein mono-ADP-ribosylation, and we observed strong signatures of recurrent positive selection throughout the macro-PARP macrodomains. Furthermore, PARP14 and PARP15 have undergone repeated rounds of gene birth and loss during vertebrate evolution, consistent with recurrent gene innovation. Together with previous studies that implicated several PARPs in immunity, as well as those that demonstrated a role for virally encoded macrodomains in host immune evasion, our evolutionary analyses suggest that addition, recognition and removal of ADP-ribosylation is a critical, underappreciated currency in host-virus conflicts.","publish_time":"2014-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Daugherty, Matthew D.; Young, Janet M.; Kerns, Julie A.; Malik, Harmit S.","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0bace106b5562f5e1cf5b124331f9c526d46d21.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4038475.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24875882/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004403","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PARP protein","human PARP genes","PARP domains","primate PARP genes","additional PARP genes","macro-PARP macrodomains","ADP-ribosylation","human genes","host-virus interactions","strong recurrent positive selection","strong signatures of recurrent positive selection","host-virus conflicts","positive selection of PARP9","encoded macrodomains","protein mono-ADP","removal of ADP","host immune evasion","recurrent gene innovation","Post-translational protein modifications","evolutionary analyses","vertebrate evolution","gene family","post-translational modifications","signatures of rapid evolution","role","important host-pathogen specificity interface","repeated rounds of gene birth","typical of domains","amino acid disordered region of PARP4","phosphorylation","ubiquitinylation","loss","common molecular targets of conflict","ZAP","underappreciated currency","recognition","viruses","PARP13","broad antiviral activity","component of cytoplasmic vault structures","arms races\u2019","viral factors","PARP15","PARPs","PARP14","diversifying","primates","ARTD","housekeeping","expectations","majority","previous studies","immunity","hosts","mammalian lineages","cases","proteins","functions"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to quantify the total number of infections imported into mainland China by arriving travellers. METHODS: We actively surveyed arriving travellers at all 272 international entry\u2013exit ports in mainland China. Suspected cases were detected through fever screening, medical inspection, self-declaration, and reporting by on-board staff. Participants completed a standardised questionnaire with questions about demographics, their travel itinerary (including detailed information about all countries or regions visited), and clinical manifestations. Nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum samples, faecal samples, vomitus, blood, and serum were collected as appropriate for diagnoses. Diagnosis was made by specific laboratory tests according to the national technical guidelines. Infections were classified as respiratory, gastrointestinal, vector-borne, blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted, or mucocutaneous. We divided arriving travellers into two groups: travellers coming from countries other than China, and travellers coming from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. We integrated surveillance data for 2014\u201316, calculated incidences of travel-related infections, and compared the frequency of infections among subgroups. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2016, 22 797 cases were identified among 805 993 392 arriving travellers\u2014an overall incidence of 28\u00B73 per million. 45 pathogens were detected in participants: 18 respiratory (19 662 cases), ten gastrointestinal (189 cases), seven vector-borne (831 cases), seven blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted (1531 cases), and three mucocutaneous (584 cases). Both the overall number and incidence of infection were more than five times higher in 2016 than in 2014. Case numbers and incidences also varied substantially by province, autonomous region, and municipality. Overall, 17 643 (77%) infections were detected by fever screening, but 753 (49%) blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infections were identified through medical inspection. 14 305 (73%) cases of respiratory infection and 96 (51%) of gastrointestinal infections were in tourists. Tuberculosis, hepatitis A virus, vector-borne, and blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infections were common among Chinese labourers who worked abroad. Dengue and malaria were most commonly diagnosed in travellers arriving from Africa. 12 126 (93%) of the 12 985 cases arriving from Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan were respiratory infections. Hand, foot, and mouth disease accounted for 2\u00B790% of infections in travellers from Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan and 0\u00B731% of infections in international travellers. INTERPRETATION: This report is the first to characterise the profile of travel-related infections among arriving travellers in mainland China. Our findings should increase public awareness of the potential risk of imported infections, and help health-care providers to make evidence-based health recommendations to travellers.

We aimed to examine the health systems and contextual factors that might have contributed to the substantial decline in maternal mortality between 1997 and 2014. We chose to focus on western China because poverty, ethnic diversity, and geographical access represent particular challenges to ensuring universal access to maternal care in the region. METHODS: In this systematic assessment, we used data from national census reports, National Statistical Yearbooks, the National Maternal and Child Health Routine Reporting System, the China National Health Accounts report, and National Health Statistical Yearbooks to describe changes in policies, health financing, health workforce, health infrastructure, coverage of maternal care, and maternal mortality by region between 1997 and 2014. We used a multivariate linear regression model to examine which contextual and health systems factors contributed to the regional variation in maternal mortality ratio in the same period. Using data from a cross-sectional survey in 2011, we also examined equity in access to maternity care in 42 poor counties in western China. FINDINGS: Maternal mortality declined by 8\u00B79% per year between 1997 and 2014 (geometric mean ratio for each year 0\u00B791, 95% CI 0\u00B791\u20130\u00B792). After adjusting for GDP per capita, length of highways, female illiteracy, the number of licensed doctors per 1000 population, and the proportion of ethnic minorities, the maternal mortality ratio was 118% higher in the western region (2\u00B718, 1\u00B744\u20133\u00B728) and 41% higher in the central region (1\u00B741, 0\u00B799\u20132\u00B701) than in the eastern region. In the rural western region, the proportion of births in health facilities rose from 41\u00B79% in 1997 to 98\u00B74% in 2014. Underpinning such progress was the Government\u0027s strong commitment to long-term strategies to ensure access to delivery care in health facilities\u2014eg, professionalisation of maternity care in large hospitals, effective referral systems for women medically or socially at high risk, and financial subsidies for antenatal and delivery care. However, in the poor western counties, substantial disparity by education level of the mother existed in access to health facility births (44% of illiterate women vs 100% of those with college or higher education), antenatal care (17% vs 69%) had at least four visits), and caesarean section (8% vs 44%). INTERPRETATION: Despite remarkable progress in maternal survival in China, substantial disparities remain, especially for the poor, less educated, and ethnic minority groups in remote areas in western China. Whether China\u0027s highly medicalised model of maternity care will be an answer for these populations is uncertain. A strategy modelled after China\u0027s immunisation programme, whereby care is provided close to the women\u0027s homes, might need to be explored, with township hospitals taking a more prominent role.

Structure-based multiepitope-fusion-antigen (MEFA) technology using a backbone immunogen to present neutralizing epitopes of representing virulence factors capacitates development of broadly protective ETEC vaccines. Neutralizing epitopes have been identified from K88 fimbrial adhesin (FaeG) and enterotoxins but not F18 fimbrial adhesin. In this study, we in silico identified immunodominant epitopes from F18ac fimbrial subunit FedF which plays a critical role in F18 fimbrial adherence, genetically fused each epitope to a carrier, examined immunogenicity of each epitope fusion, and determined epitope-derived antibodies neutralizing activities against F18 fimbrial adherence. Data showed that seven immune-dominant epitopes were identified from FedF subunit. Fused to heterologous human ETEC adhesin subunit CfaB, epitope fusions induced anti-F18 antibodies in subcutaneously immunized mice. Moreover, antibodies derived from each fusion significantly blocked adherence of a F18-fimbrial E. coli bacteria to pig intestinal cell line IPEC-J2. While all seven epitopes exhibited neutralizing activity, results from this study identified FedF epitopes #3 (IPSSSGTLTCQAGT) and #7 (QPDATGSWYD) the most effective for antibodies against F18 fimbrial adherence, and suggested their future application in PWD vaccine development.","publish_time":"2019-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Ti; Seo, Hyesuk; Moxley, Rodney A.; Zhang, Weiping","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20e79fc5f7893e8decf5f86711ab3ea1802346e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173344.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518312239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827385/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518312239; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.02.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli","E. coli"],"organizations":["ETEC","PWD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["F18-fimbrial","F18 fimbrial adherence","F18 fimbrial adhesin","K88 fimbrial adhesin","F18 fimbrial ETEC bacterial attachment","FedF epitopes","anti-F18 antibodies","F18 fimbrial enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","F18ac fimbrial subunit FedF","present neutralizing epitopes","immunodominant epitopes","epitope-derived antibodies","FedF subunit","immune-dominant epitopes","epitope fusions","blocked adherence","neutralizing activity","PWD vaccine development","heterologous human ETEC adhesin subunit CfaB","protective ETEC vaccines","study","coli bacteria","Structure-based multiepitope-fusion","pig small intestines","colonization","virulence factors","critical role","MEFA","technology","backbone immunogen","major causes of post-weaning diarrhea","results","intestinal cell line IPEC-J2","enterotoxins","activities","enterotoxin enterotoxicity","future application","antigen","silico","FaeG","broad immunity","immunized mice","immunogenicity","pigs","QPDATGSWYD","carrier","IPSSSGTLTCQAGT","Data"],"language":"en"},

The pathological changes in several human organs of patients with SARS have been extensively described. However, to date, little has been reported about the effects of this infection on the thyroid gland. Femoral head necrosis and low serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels, commonly found in patients with SARS, raise the possibility of thyroid dysfunction. We have undertaken this study to evaluate for any potential injury to the thyroid gland caused by SARS on tissue samples obtained from 5 SARS autopsies. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUPT nick end\u2013labeling assay was performed to identify apoptotic cells. The follicular epithelium was found to be damaged with large numbers of cells exfoliated into the follicle. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUPT nick end\u2013labeling assay demonstrated many cells undergoing apoptosis. Follicular architecture was altered and showed distortion, dilatation, and collapse. No distinct calcitonin-positive cells were detectable in the SARS thyroids. In conclusion, both parafollicular and follicular cells were injured. This may provide an explanation both for low serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels and the osteonecrosis of the femoral head associated with patients with SARS. Apoptosis may play a role in the pathogenesis of SARS associated coronavirus infection in the thyroid gland.","publish_time":"2007-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Lan; Sun, Shen; Xu, Cai-hong; Zhang, Jing; Xu, Yun; Zhu, Hong; Peh, Suat-cheng; Korteweg, Christine; McNutt, Michael A.; Gu, Jiang","journal":"Human Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9c10c3b7be00f35f9b533f07a17368717c11b7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112059.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0046817706003807; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0046817706003807","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of SARS","SARS autopsies","SARS thyroids","follicular cells","thyroid gland","apoptotic cells","large numbers of cells","terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUPT nick end","labeling assay","low serum triiodothyronine","thyroxine levels","distinct calcitonin-positive cells","possibility of thyroid dysfunction","Follicular architecture","apoptosis","follicular epithelium","Femoral head necrosis","human organs of patients","coronavirus infection","severe acute respiratory syndrome","tissue samples","osteonecrosis","Summary","distortion","epidemic","potential injury","pathological changes","explanation","role","conclusion","dilatation","collapse","study","follicle","effects","date"],"language":"en"},

We expressed the antiviral lectin griffithsin (GRFT), which shows potent neutralizing activity against HIV, in the endosperm of transgenic rice plants (Oryza sativa), to determine whether rice can be used to produce inexpensive GRFT as a microbicide ingredient. The yield of (OS)GRFT in the best\u2010performing plants was 223 \u03BCg/g dry seed weight. We also established a one\u2010step purification protocol, achieving a recovery of 74% and a purity of 80%, which potentially could be developed into a larger\u2010scale process to facilitate inexpensive downstream processing. (OS)GRFT bound to HIV glycans with similar efficiency to GRFT produced in Escherichia coli. Whole\u2010cell assays using purified (OS)GRFT and infectivity assays using crude extracts of transgenic rice endosperm confirmed that both crude and pure (OS)GRFT showed potent activity against HIV and the crude extracts were not toxic towards human cell lines, suggesting they could be administered as a microbicide with only minimal processing. A freedom\u2010to\u2010operate analysis confirmed that GRFT produced in rice is suitable for commercial development, and an economic evaluation suggested that 1.8 kg/ha of pure GRFT could be produced from rice seeds. Our data therefore indicate that rice could be developed as an inexpensive production platform for GRFT as a microbicide component.","publish_time":"2016-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vamvaka, Evangelia; Arcalis, Elsa; Ramessar, Koreen; Evans, Abbey; O\u0027Keefe, Barry R.; Shattock, Robin J.; Medina, Vicente; St\u00F6ger, Eva; Christou, Paul; Capell, Teresa","journal":"Plant Biotechnol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/646d3092d14896e26c741391f0b5fe5b724f4a39.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4865440.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pbi.12507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26800650/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GRFT"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["inexpensive GRFT","ha of pure GRFT","rice seeds","HIV glycans","crude extracts of transgenic rice endosperm","endosperm of transgenic rice plants","potent activity","potent neutralizing activity","cell assays","inexpensive downstream processing","microbicide component","microbicide ingredient","inexpensive production platform","human cell lines","infectivity assays","neutralizing antibodies","antiviral lectins","minimal processing","human immunodeficiency virus","antiviral lectin griffithsin","cost affordable","\u03BCg","endemic regions","similar efficiency","large quantities","rate of infection","commercial development","scale process","Oryza sativa","g dry seed weight","Protein microbicides","recovery","components","best","economic evaluation","sub\u2010Saharan Africa","Escherichia coli","one\u2010step purification protocol","analysis","yield","purity","freedom","data"],"language":"en"},

A major driver of these gene expression changes is a virally encoded, messenger RNA (mRNA)-specific endonuclease termed SOX. SOX cleaves the majority of cytoplasmic mRNAs, but does so at specific internal sites loosely defined by a degenerate sequence motif. If and how RNA sequence directs SOX targeting remained unknown. To address these questions, we used recombinant, highly purified SOX endonuclease in a series of biochemical assays to reconstitute the cleavage reaction in vitro and gain significant insight into the biochemical mechanism of both SOX target recognition and endonucleolytic cleavage. Using this system, we determined that cut site specificity is preserved with purified SOX and a validated target RNA and thus does not require additional cellular cofactors. Furthermore, we showed that SOX displays robust, sequence-specific RNA binding to residues proximal to the cleavage site, which must be presented in a particular structural context. The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of target RNA susceptibility observed in cells. Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic human virus that causes Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease. During viral replication, KSHV expresses an enzyme called SOX that cuts and inactivates the majority of cellular messenger RNAs, preventing their translation into proteins. Some mRNAs are efficiently cleaved by SOX, while others are poorly cleaved, but the mechanistic basis underlying this selectivity has remained largely unknown. Here, we reveal that the efficiency of RNA cleavage is heavily impacted by RNA sequences proximal to the cleavage site, which serve as a SOX binding platform. This helps explain both the range of RNA cleavage efficiency observed in SOX-expressing cells as well as the sequence specificity underlying SOX targeting.","publish_time":"2018-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendez, Aaron S.; Vogt, Carolin; Bohne, Jens; Glaunsinger, Britt A.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/69a264b6ce4df3496146dfd0add9ffc47615605c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/532dc582abd41e833303742ca40976db63fe6fc1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/320929","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SOX","RNA","KSHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficiency of RNA cleavage","SOX target recognition","purified SOX endonuclease","SOX binding platform","cleavage site","range of RNA cleavage efficiency","strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency","sequence-specific RNA binding","validated target RNA","cleavage reaction","endonucleolytic cleavage","RNA sequences proximal","breadth of target RNA susceptibility","KSHV","sequence specificity","specific endonuclease","site specificity","viral replication","lytic replication of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus","degenerate sequence motif","cells","majority of cellular messenger RNAs","gene expression changes","specific internal sites","gene expression landscape","majority of cytoplasmic mRNAs","biochemical mechanism","residues proximal","series of biochemical assays","additional cellular cofactors","primary effusion lymphoma","explanation","oncogenic human virus","environment favorable","significant insight","multicentric Castleman disease","translation","major driver","enzyme","immune response","mechanistic basis","selectivity","particular structural context","proteins","questions","system"],"language":"en"},

In this sense, dental offices, both in the public and private sectors, are high-risk settings of cross infection among patients, dentists and health professionals in the clinical environment (including hospital\u0027s intensive dental care facilities). This manuscript aims to compile current available evidence on prevention strategies for dental professionals. Besides, we briefly describe promising treatment strategies recognized until this moment. The purpose is to clarify dental practitioners about the virus history and microbiology, besides guiding on how to proceed during emergency consultations based on international documents. Dentists should consider that a substantial number of individuals (including children) who do not show any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may be infected and can disseminate the virus. Currently, there is no effective treatment and fast diagnosis is still a challenge. All elective dental treatments and non-essential procedures should be postponed, keeping only urgent and emergency visits to the dental office. The use of teledentistry (phone calls, text messages) is a very promising tool to keep contact with the patient without being at risk of infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pereira, Luciano Jos\u00E9; Pereira, Cassio Vicente; Murata, Ramiro Mendon\u00E7a; Pardi, Vanessa; Pereira-Dourado, Stela M\u00E1rcia","journal":"Brazilian oral research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401931/; https://doi.org/10.1590/1807-3107bor-2020.vol34.0041","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dental professionals","dental practitioners","dental offices","elective dental treatments","health professionals","hospital\u0027s intensive dental care facilities","dentists","promising treatment strategies","hours","virus history","prevention strategies","promising tool","emergency visits","emergency consultations","risk of infection","symptoms of COVID","effective treatment","high-risk settings of cross infection","patients","clinical environment","current available evidence","high virulence","text messages","routes of transmission","phone calls","non-essential procedures","private sectors","growing concern","use of teledentistry","fast diagnosis","stainless-steel surfaces","substantial number of individuals","saliva aerosols","children","manuscript","expansion of coronavirus disease","international documents","contact","plastic","microbiology","air","moment","world","challenge","signs","sense","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Low mannan-binding lectin (MBL) levels, caused by MBL2 polymorphisms, are suggested to contribute to susceptibility to respiratory tract infections (RTIs), particularly early in life. Large-scale replication of previous associations is needed, however. We investigated the association between MBL2 polymorphisms and the frequency of RTI in a large population-based birth cohort of white children. Methods. The frequency of RTI was prospectively assessed by annual parental questionnaires until children were 4 years of age. Thirteen polymorphisms in MBL2 were determined in 987 Dutch children. Haplotypes, previously shown to be associated with functional levels of MBL, were constructed, and their associations with the frequency of RTI during year 1, year 2, and the first 4 years of life were assessed. High-producing, intermediate-producing, and deficient MBL2 genotypes were defined on the basis of exon 1 and Y/X promoter polymorphisms. Results. No differences were found between investigated polymorphisms and haplotype frequencies in the population as a whole or between the groups with frequent, moderately frequent, or no RTIs reported. Deficient MBL2 genotypes were not associated with an increased risk of RTI (odds ratio, 0.71 [95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 2.05]) during years 1\u20134 of life. This was also true when year 1 and year 2 were studied separately. Conclusion. These results suggest that, at the population level, MBL2 polymorphisms do not contribute to the risk of questionnaire-reported RTI in white children.","publish_time":"2008-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ruskamp, Jopje M.; Hoekstra, Maarten O.; Postma, Dirkje S.; Kerkhof, Marjan; Bottema, Renske W.; Koppelman, Gerard H.; Rovers, Maroeska M.; Wijga, Alet H.; de Jongste, Johan C.; Brunekreef, Bert; Sanders, Elisabeth A.","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f67766814dbcedf511eafe5b6348d87d082815a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109965.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18847375/; https://doi.org/10.1086/592989","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MBL2 polymorphisms","frequency of RTI","investigated polymorphisms","deficient MBL2 genotypes","years of life","increased risk of RTI","X promoter polymorphisms","Dutch children","population level","RTIs","years of age","Results","large population-based birth cohort of white children","functional levels of MBL","risk of questionnaire","Large-scale replication of previous associations","Low mannan-binding lectin","odds ratio","annual parental questionnaires","susceptibility","respiratory tract infections","basis of exon","haplotype frequencies","groups","differences","confidence interval","Background","Methods","Haplotypes","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of this retrospective observational study was to investigate the outcomes of emergency resuscitation after implementation of ICMs. Data were collected for the period 1 January to 4 July in 2003 from a 1732-bed tertiary care hospital in central Taiwan. Non-trauma patients who required emergency resuscitation were classified into two groups: before (period 1), and after (period 2), the date on which strict ICMs were implemented. The analysis variables included demographic data of patients, place of resuscitation, number of participating resuscitators, response time and duration of resuscitation, fever, pneumonia status and results of resuscitation. The response time was unchanged but the number of patient resuscitations without an emergency intubation, rapid sequence intubation or a \u2018do not resuscitate\u2019 order increased from 88 (24.4%), 23 (6.4%) and 16 (4.4%) in period 1 to 103 (33.0%), 32 (10.3%) and 29 (9.3%) in period 2, respectively.

The number of emergency resuscitations in patients with fever or pneumonia was not significantly different between these two periods. In conclusion, strict ICM implementation appeared to play a role in the increased failure rate in emergency resuscitation.

The aim of this study was to assess the immunogenicity of chimeric RHDV-VLPs as vaccine vectors in pigs. For this purpose, we have generated chimeric VLPs containing a well-known T epitope of 3A protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Firstly, RHDV-VLPs were able to activate immature porcine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (poBMDCs) in vitro. Secondly, pigs were inoculated twice in a two-week interval with chimeric RHDV-VLPs at different doses intranasally or intramuscularly. One intramuscularly treated group was also inoculated with adjuvant Montanide\u2122 ISA 206 at the same time. Specific IgG and IgA antibodies against RHDV-VLPs were induced and such levels were higher in the adjuvanted group compared with other groups. Interestingly, anti-RHDV-VLP IgA responses were higher in groups inoculated intramuscularly than those that received the VLPs intranasally. Two weeks after the last immunisation, specific IFN-\u03B3-secreting cells against 3A epitope and against RHDV-VLPs were detected in PBMCs by ELISPOT. The adjuvanted group exhibited the highest IFN-\u03B3-secreting cell numbers and lymphoproliferative specific T cell responses against 3A epitope and RHDV-VLP. This is the first immunological report on the potential use of chimeric RHDV-VLPs as antigen carriers in pigs.","publish_time":"2012-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crisci, E.; Fraile, L.; Moreno, N.; Blanco, E.; Cabez\u00F3n, R.; Costa, C.; Muss\u00E1, T.; Baratelli, M.; Martinez-Orellana, P.; Ganges, L.; Mart\u00EDnez, J.; B\u00E1rcena, J.; Montoya, M.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e532698cbb198415437014fb1427e4016b3d5e77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115503.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12001077; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.01.069; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X12001077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22306796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chimeric VLPs","immunogenicity of chimeric RHDV-VLPs","potential use of chimeric RHDV-VLPs","anti-RHDV-VLP IgA responses","pigs","adjuvanted group","specific IFN-\u03B3","well-known T epitope","lymphoproliferative specific T cell responses","immune responses","secreting cells","Specific IgG","inserted foreign epitope","mouth disease virus","Abstract Virus","treated group","groups","rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus","secreting cell numbers","highest IFN-\u03B3","potential application","IgA antibodies","immature porcine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells","protein of foot","vaccine vectors","antigen carriers","veterinary vaccines","considerable attention","two-week interval","poBMDCs","immunisation","particles","levels","different doses","adjuvant Montanide","immunological report","good platforms","mice","FMDV","PBMCs","study","weeks","ELISPOT","purpose","aim","time"],"language":"en"},

Herein, arthropod-borne disease are reviewed, with special emphasis on the existing risk to contract them in Spain according to different parameters, such as the presence of arthropod and the circulation or the possible circulation of the causative agents.","publish_time":"2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Portillo, Ar\u00E1nzazu; Ruiz-Arrondo, Ignacio; Oteo, Jos\u00E9 A.","journal":"Medicina Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91fcb3f81fe0f0c0a1538307330e5176668fd5f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094594.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025775318304433; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775318304433","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["D\u00EDpteros","Salud P\u00FAblica"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["artr\u00F3podo y","especial hincapi\u00E9 en","riesgo existente para contraerlas en Espa\u00F1a en funci\u00F3n","los artr\u00F3podos vectores para adaptarse","emergencia y reemergencia","diferentes par\u00E1metros","gran importancia en Salud P\u00FAblica","pulgas y piojos","cul\u00EDcidos y fleb\u00F3tomos","arthropod vectors","presence of arthropod","diferentes afecciones transmitidas por artr\u00F3podos vectores","En esta revisi\u00F3n se repasan","los agentes causales","circulaci\u00F3n o posible circulaci\u00F3n","gran capacidad","Resumen Diferentes aspectos relacionados","possible circulation","different parameters","numerosos procesos infecciosos transmitidos por los mismos","wide spectrum of diseases","Abstract Different aspects","reemergence of numerous infectious diseases","haciendo","mundo cambiante propician","enfermedades","entre otros","variado espectro","provocan","globalizaci\u00F3n junto","garrapatas","presencia","como","globalization","relevance","changing world","sandflies","ticks","special emphasis","existing risk","Spain","great capacity","public health","mosquitoes"],"language":"en"},

In this report, we describe the symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) in one infected patient with COVID-19, for the first time. We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection. The electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS. COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes. GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it. It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides. Further investigations should be conducted about the mechanism of GBS in patients with COVID-19, in the future.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sedaghat, Zahra; Karimi, Narges","journal":"J Clin Neurosci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3f5f8733398c14adde7dd0ee67923c9fe4a3735.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158817.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967586820308821; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2020.04.062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32312628/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0967586820308821","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GBS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","mechanism of GBS","infected patient","immune-mediated disorder","AMSAN variant of GBS","years- old male patient","mechanism of autoimmune disorder","immune-mediated processes","inflammatory cells","obvious symptoms","various inflammatory cytokines","symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome","complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis","molecular mimicry","respiratory complications","multiple systemic infections","result","RT-PCR","cough","fever","production of antibodies","important role","specific gangliosides","Coronaviruses","hospitalization","patients","Novel outbreak","electrodiagnostic test","weeks","report","investigations","future","time"],"language":"en"},

However, it is not clear whether the reported association relates to influenza infection severity. The aim of this study was to estimate the hospitalization risk associated with this variant in Influenza Like Illness (ILI) patients during the H1N1 pandemic influenza. METHODS: A case-control genetic association study was performed, using nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs collected during the H1N1 pandemic influenza. Laboratory diagnosis of influenza infection was performed by RT-PCR, the IFITM3 rs12252 was genotyped by RFLP and tested for association with hospitalization. Conditional logistic regression was performed to calculate the confounder-adjusted odds ratio of hospitalization associated with IFITM3 rs12252. RESULTS: We selected 312 ILI cases and 624 matched non-hospitalized controls. Within ILI Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive patients, no statistical significant association was found between the variant and the hospitalization risk (Adjusted OR: 0.73 (95%CI: 0.33\u20131.50)). Regarding ILI Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 negative patients, CT/CC genotype carriers had a higher risk of being hospitalized than patients with TT genotype (Adjusted OR: 2.54 (95%CI: 1.54\u20134.19)). CONCLUSIONS: The IFITM3 rs12252 variant was associated with respiratory infection hospitalization but not specifically in patients infected with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.","publish_time":"2016-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaio, V\u00E2nia; Nunes, Baltazar; Pechirra, Pedro; Conde, Patr\u00EDcia; Guiomar, Raquel; Dias, Carlos Matias; Barreto, Marta","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4ee51bb838b0cdc2e59317a4b837f2997795b665.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4924831.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27351739/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Interferon Inducible Transmembrane","Influenza Like Illness","RFLP","CT/CC","TT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ILI Influenza","H1N1 pandemic influenza","course of influenza infection","influenza infection severity","IFITM3 rs12252 variant","hospitalization risk","Laboratory diagnosis of influenza infection","respiratory infection hospitalization","pdm09 negative patients","pdm09 positive patients","reported association","ILI cases","statistical significant association","confounder-adjusted odds ratio of hospitalization","case-control genetic association study","higher risk","TT genotype","CC genotype carriers","matched non-hospitalized controls","Interferon Inducible Transmembrane","oropharyngeal swabs","RT-PCR","RFLP","Illness","Recent studies","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","Conditional logistic regression","RESULTS","aim"],"language":"en"},

The antigenicity, pathogenicity and epidemiology of this virus have been unclear. Here we first used a recombinant baculovirus expression system to express the 13 and 111 N-terminus amino-acid-truncated DcHEV ORF2 protein in insect Tn5 cells, and we obtained two types of virus-like particles (VLPs) with densities of 1.300g/cm3 and 1.285g/cm3, respectively. The small VLPs (Dc4sVLPs) were estimated to be 24nm in diameter, and were assembled by a protein with the molecular mass 53kDa. The large VLPs (Dc3nVLPs and Dc4nVLPs) were 35nm in diameter, and were assembled by a 64-kDa protein. An antigenic analysis demonstrated that DcHEV was cross-reactive with G1, G3\u2013G6, ferret and rat HEVs, and DcHEV showed a stronger cross-reactivity to G1 G3\u2013G6 HEV than it did to rat and ferret HEV. In addition, the antibody against DcHEV-LPs neutralized G1 and G3 HEV in a cell culture system, suggesting that the serotypes of these HEVs are identical.

Indeed, most viruses can also be transmitted through direct contact and droplets. Therefore, the importance of the airborne route in a clinical context is difficult to determine. The aim of this study was to design a chamber system to study the airborne transmission of viruses between ferrets. Methods: A system composed of three chambers connected in series, each one housing one ferret and preventing direct contact, was designed. The chambers were designed to house the ferrets for several days and to study the transmission of viruses from an infected (index) ferret to two na\u00EFve ferrets via aerosols and droplets or aerosols only. A particle separator was designed that can be used to modulate the size of the particles traveling between the chambers. The chamber system was validated using standard dust as well as with ferrets infected with influenza A virus. Conclusions: The 50% efficiency cut-off of the separator could be modulated between a 5-\u00B5m and an 8-\u00B5m aerodynamic diameter. In the described setup, influenza A virus was transmitted through the aerosol route in two out of three experiments, and through aerosols and droplets in all three experiments.","publish_time":"2019-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turgeon, Nathalie; Hamelin, Marie-\u00C8ve; Verreault, Daniel; L\u00E9vesque, Ariane; Rh\u00E9aume, Chantal; Carbonneau, Julie; Checkmahomed, Liva; Girard, Matthieu; Boivin, Guy; Duchaine, Caroline","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5eb20deb48c231973cf0a796ca1c6898cbf2d07d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6406687.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16040609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791478/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["importance of aerosols","influenza","droplets","chambers","study","airborne transmission of viruses","na\u00EFve ferrets","chamber system","spread of viruses","airborne route","direct contact","experiments","aerosol route","particle separator","\u00B5m aerodynamic diameter","index","clinical context","housing","standard dust","efficiency cut-off","described setup","series","subject of debate","Conclusions","particles","Background","days","size","aim","Methods"],"language":"en"},

While varicella is likely spread as cell-free virus to susceptible hosts, the virus is transmitted by cell-to-cell spread in the body and in vitro. Since VZV glycoprotein E (gE) is essential for virus infection, we postulated that gE binds to a cellular receptor. We found that insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) interacts with gE through its extracellular domain. Downregulation of IDE by siRNA, or blocking of IDE with antibody, with soluble IDE protein extracted from liver, or with bacitracin inhibited VZV infection. Cell-to-cell spread of virus was also impaired by blocking IDE. Transfection of cell lines impaired for VZV infection with a plasmid expressing human IDE resulted in increased entry and enhanced infection with cell-free and cell-associated virus. These studies indicate that IDE is a cellular receptor for both cell-free and cell-associated VZV.","publish_time":"2006-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Qingxue; Ali, Mir A.; Cohen, Jeffrey I.","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eba30aa66abb1e20a5e265b63f94c6734c909c93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125743.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867406012700; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867406012700","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VZV","IDE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell-free virus","cell-associated virus","cell-associated VZV","virus infection","human IDE","Transfection of cell lines","Downregulation of IDE","gE","soluble IDE protein","bacitracin inhibited VZV infection","enhanced infection","Summary Varicella-zoster virus","VZV glycoprotein E","cellular receptor","increased entry","liver","plasmid","susceptible hosts","chickenpox","antibody","enzyme","siRNA","extracellular domain","shingles","insulin","studies"],"language":"en"},

In this study, an original US, highly virulent PED virus (PEDV) strain PC22A was serially passaged in Vero CCL81 and Vero BI cells. The virus growth kinetics in cell culture, virulence in neonatal pigs and the whole genomic sequences of selected passages were examined. Increased virus titers and sizes of syncytia were observed at the 65th passage level (P65) and P120, respectively. Based on the severity of clinical signs, histopathological lesions and the distribution of PEDV antigens in the gut, the virulence of P100 and above, but not P95C13 (CCL81), was markedly reduced in 4-day-old, caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets. Subsequently, the attenuation of P120 and P160 was confirmed in 4-day-old, conventional suckling piglets. Compared with P120, P160 replicated less efficiently in the intestine of pigs and induced a lower rate of protection after challenge. Sequence analysis revealed that the virulent viruses [P3 and P95C13 (CCL81)] had one, one, sixteen (including an early termination of nine amino acids) and two amino acid differences in non-structure protein 1 (nsp1), nsp4, spike and membrane proteins, respectively, from the fully attenuated P160. However, the overall pattern of attenuation-related genetic changes in PC22A differed from those of the other four pairs of PEDV wild type strains and their attenuated derivatives. These results suggest that PEDV attenuation can occur through multiple molecular mechanisms. The knowledge provides insights into potential molecular mechanisms of PEDV attenuation.","publish_time":"2017-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Chun-Ming; Hou, Yixuan; Marthaler, Douglas G.; Gao, Xiang; Liu, Xinsheng; Zheng, Lanlan; Saif, Linda J.; Wang, Qiuhong","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef633a7b465c43413318b4e7545ffd10a8cde8d1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117544.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516306903; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.01.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28284624/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516306903","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjszMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Vero BI","PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["attenuation of P120","attenuated P160","potential molecular mechanisms of PEDV attenuation","Vero CCL81","virulent PED virus","distribution of PEDV antigens","overall pattern of attenuation","attenuated derivatives","attenuated vaccine","day-old","P95C13","pairs of PEDV wild type strains","virus growth kinetics","Increased virus titers","multiple molecular mechanisms","amino acids","virulent viruses","strain PC22A","neonatal pigs","virulence of P100","intestine of pigs","amino acid differences","Vero BI cells","colostrum-deprived piglets","conventional suckling piglets","cell culture","histopathological lesions","non-structure protein","pork industry","related genetic changes","huge economic losses","nsp4","nsp1","gut","original US","insights","sizes of syncytia","severity of clinical signs","porcine epidemic diarrhea","spike","genomic sequences of selected passages","lower rate of protection","knowledge","P3","passage level","membrane proteins","challenge","caesarian","early termination","Sequence analysis","P65","study","results"],"language":"en"},

In this study, to monitor rapidly and simply oseltamivir\u2010resistant A/H1N1pdm viruses possessing H275Y, a duplex one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR assay (H275Y RT\u2010PCR assay) was developed based on an endpoint genotyping analysis method. H275Y RT\u2010PCR assay evaluated using several subtypes/types of influenza A and B viruses and other respiratory pathogenic viruses and shown to have high sensitivity and high specificity. Forty\u2010four clinical specimens were tested after RNA purification using the H275Y RT\u2010PCR assay, resulting in one clinical specimen being found to contain a virus possessing the H275Y mutation. Seventy\u2010three clinical isolates were then tested with the H275Y assay by using clinical isolates in the cultured supernatants of cells directly, without RNA purification, and the results were consistent with the NA sequencing.

Together with toroviruses, they are classified in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. All coronaviruses have four common proteins, three in the envelope and one associated with the genome. Assembly of virus particles occurs at internal membranes. The genes for the structural proteins are at the 3\u2032 end of the genome. Most of the genome (\u223C20kb) is gene 1, which encodes 15\u201316 proteins associated with RNA replication and transcription. Translation of gene 1 involves ribosomal frameshifting. Transcription is by a discontinuous process which results in a 3\u2032 co-terminal nested set of mRNAs, each of which has a common leader sequence transcribed from the 5\u2032 terminus of the genome. Only the most 5\u2032-proximal gene of each mRNA is translated. Recombination is a feature of coronavirus evolution. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has resulted in the discovery of more coronaviruses in humans, other mammals, and avian species, and the realization that the host range of coronaviruses is wider than previously acknowledged. Coronaviruses are associated with a wide range of diseases, including the respiratory and enteric systems, though not necessarily restricted to these, for example, some coronaviruses affect the central nervous system, kidneys, and gonads.

In addition, we have studied the secondary structure of specific membrane\u2010interacting peptides from the HCV core protein, both in aqueous solution and in the presence of model membrane systems. Our results show that the HCV core protein region comprising the C\u2010terminus of domain 1 and the N\u2010terminus of domain 2 seems to be the most active in membrane interaction, although a role in protein\u2013protein interaction cannot be excluded. Significantly, the secondary structure of nearly all the assayed peptides changes in the presence of model membranes. These sequences most probably play a relevant part in the biological action of HCV in lipid interaction.

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 in China as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Two other coronavirus infections\u2014SARS in 2002-2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012\u2014both caused severe respiratory syndrome in humans. All 3 of these emerging infectious diseases leading to a global spread are caused by \u03B2-coronaviruses. Although coronaviruses usually infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, viral shedding in plasma or serum is common. Therefore, there is still a theoretical risk of transmission of coronaviruses through the transfusion of labile blood products. Because more and more asymptomatic infections are being found among COVID-19 cases, considerations of blood safety and coronaviruses have arisen especially in endemic areas.

Furthermore, there is an inverse relationship between exogenous supplementation and bioavailability, i.e., fairly high oral doses are not fully absorbed and thus a significant amount of carnitine remains in the gut. Human and rat enterobacteria can degrade unabsorbed l-carnitine to trimethylamine or trimethylamine-N-oxide, which, under certain conditions, may be transformed to the known carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine. Recent findings indicate that trimethylamine-N-oxide might also be involved in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. We therefore investigated whether a 1-year administration of different l-carnitine concentrations (0, 1, 2 and 5 g/l) via drinking water leads to an increased incidence of preneoplastic lesions (so-called aberrant crypt foci) in the colon of Fischer 344 rats as well as to the appearance of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta of these animals. No significant difference between the test groups regarding the formation of lesions in the colon and aorta of the rats was observed, suggesting that, under the given experimental conditions, l-carnitine up to a concentration of 5 g/l in the drinking water does not have adverse effects on the gastrointestinal and vascular system of Fischer 344 rats.

A questionnaire was designed and piloted prior to its administration to veterinarians at the annual Australian Veterinary Association Conference in May 2011. The questionnaire comprised 21 closed, semi-closed and open questions. Data from the questionnaire were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression analyses to determine significant factors for veterinarians\u2019 use of personal protective equipment (PPE). A total of 344 veterinarians completed the questionnaire of which 63.7% were women, 63.2% worked in small/companion animal practice, and 79.9% worked in private veterinary practice. Of the respondents, 44.9% reported contracting a zoonosis during their careers with 19.7% reporting a suspected case and 25.2% reporting a confirmed incidence. Around 40\u201360% of veterinarians perceived exposure to zoonosis likely or very likely in a variety of situations. With reference to current national industry guidelines, the reported use of PPE was less than \u201Cadequate\u201D for most scenarios except for performing postmortems, surgery or dental procedures. No PPE was used by 60\u201370% of veterinarians for treating respiratory and neurological cases and by 40\u201350% when treating gastrointestinal and dermatological cases. Workplace conditions need improvement as 34.8% of workplaces did not have isolation units for infected animals, 21.1% did not have separate eating areas for staff, and 57.1% did not have complete PPE kits for use. Veterinarians were more likely to use PPE if they had undertaken postgraduate education, perceived that zoonosis exposure from animals and procedures was likely, consciously considered PPE use for every case they dealt with and believed that liability issues and risks encouraged use of PPE. In contrast, those working in private practices, those who tended to \u2018just hope for the best\u2019 when trying to avoid zoonotic diseases, and those who were not aware of industry guidelines were less likely to use PPE. The results suggest that veterinarians\u2019 perceptions and workplace policies and culture substantially influence their use of PPE. Efforts should be made to encourage veterinarians and their workplaces to use infection control practices to protect themselves and their staff from zoonotic diseases.","publish_time":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dowd, Karen; Taylor, Melanie; Toribio, Jenny-Ann L.M.L.; Hooker, Claire; Dhand, Navneet K.","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/244d508764bc18484a07addd4497b215b0d64098.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127186.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587713001268; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2013.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587713001268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23664739/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPE use","reported use of PPE","Australian veterinarians","zoonosis likely","questionnaire","complete PPE kits","zoonotic diseases","veterinarians\u2019 use of personal protective equipment","protective practices","private practices","infection control practices","zoonosis exposure","veterinarians\u2019 perceptions","perceptions of zoonotic disease risk","workplaces","staff","private veterinary practice","aware of industry guidelines","significant factors","current national industry guidelines","workplace policies","dental procedures","infected animals","Workplace conditions","neurological cases","dermatological cases","suspected case","annual Australian Veterinary Association Conference","companion animal practice","ordinal logistic regression analyses","culture","postmortems","surgery","isolation units","open questions","reference","postgraduate education","risks","liability issues","scenarios","separate eating areas","improvement","results","administration","variety of situations","careers","women","contrast","total","confirmed incidence","study","Data","best","Efforts","respondents"],"language":"en"},

Treatment services for people who use drugs provide essential treatment services including opiate agonist treatment and needle syringe programmes alongside other important treatment programmes across all substance types including withdrawal and counselling services. Drug and alcohol hospital consultation-liaison clinicians support emergency departments and other services provided in hospital settings in efficiently managing patients who use drugs and present with other health problems. COVID-19 will impact on staff availability for work due to illness. Patients may require home isolation and quarantine periods. Ensuring ongoing supply of opiate treatment during these periods will require significant changes to how treatment is provided. The use of monthly depot buprenorphine as well as moving from a framework of supervised dosing will be required for patients on sublingual buprenorphine and methadone. Ensuring ready access to take-home naloxone for patients is crucial to reduce overdose risks. Delivery of methadone and buprenorphine to the homes of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections is likely to need to occur to support home isolation. People who use drugs are likely to be more vulnerable during the COVID-19 epidemic, due to poorer health literacy and stigma and discrimination towards this group. People who use drugs may prioritise drug use above other health concerns. Adequate supply of clean injecting equipment is important to prevent outbreaks of blood-borne viruses. Opiate users may misinterpret SARS-CoV2 symptoms as opiate withdrawal and manage this by using opioids. Ensuring people who use drugs have access to drug treatment as well as access to screening and testing for SARS-CoV2 where this is indicated is important.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dunlop, Adrian; Lokuge, Buddhima; Masters, Debbie; Sequeira, Marcia; Saul, Peter; Dunlop, Grace; Ryan, John; Hall, Michelle; Ezard, Nadine; Haber, Paul; Lintzeris, Nicholas; Maher, Lisa","journal":"Harm Reduct J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ea53141eb886a31e45fa2c12fc34ad33b583a17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201394.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00370-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32375887/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["drugs","drug treatment","drug use","essential treatment services","health services","important treatment programmes","opiate agonist treatment","patients","ongoing supply of opiate treatment","counselling services","homes of people","impact of COVID","use of monthly depot buprenorphine","opiate withdrawal","Opiate users","health problems","health concerns","confirmed COVID","poorer health literacy","ready access","sublingual buprenorphine","home isolation","high impact","SARS-CoV2 symptoms","hospital settings","quarantine periods","Delivery of methadone","needle syringe programmes","alcohol hospital consultation-liaison clinicians support emergency departments","Adequate supply of clean injecting equipment","substance types","stigma","discrimination","take-home naloxone","epidemic","screening","outbreaks of blood","testing","infections","significant changes","overdose risks","framework of supervised dosing","staff availability","illness","viruses","group","opioids"],"language":"en"},

The viral infected cells exhibit a complicated cross-talking between autophagy and virus. It has been shown that autophagy interacts with both adaptive and innate immunity. For adaptive immunity, viral antigens can be processed in autophagosomes by acidic proteases before major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II presentation. For innate immunity, autophagy may assist in the delivery of viral nucleic acids to endosomal TLRs and also functions as a part of the TLR-or-PKR-downstream responses. Autophagy was also reported to suppress the magnitude of host innate antiviral immunity in certain cases. On the other hand, viruses has evolved many strategies to combat or utilize the host autophagy for their own benefit. In this review we discussed recent advances toward clarifying the cross-talking between autophagy and viral infection in mammalian cells.","publish_time":"2010-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Hongya; Zhang, Lishu; Dai, Xinxian; Zheng, Yanpeng","journal":"Front Biol (Beijing)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2259a72aee5cd2fcd11ffd37e0e788e3f68e1167.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215004/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11515-010-0760-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host autophagy","viral infection","innate immunity","viral antigens","adaptive immunity","viral infected cells","antiviral immunity","delivery of viral nucleic acids","complicated cross","cellular process","mammalian cells","magnitude of host","cellular homeostasis","major histocompatibility complex","disease states","MHC","degradation of long-lived proteins","autophagosomes","acidic proteases","class","wide range of human health","cytosol","organelles","endosomal TLRs","certain cases","presentation","strategies","recent advances","PKR-downstream responses","hand","viruses","review","benefit"],"language":"en"},

Routine screening of foodstuffs for virus contamination is seldom performed, and may not be wholly cost-effective. Prevention of contamination through risk management of critical control points is more realistic, but physical means of virus elimination will always be required in case of failure of procedural controls.

In Colombia, the virus was first detected in the earliest 70\u0027s when the disease became a major public health concern. Since then, all four serotypes of the virus have been reported. Although most of the huge outbreaks reported in this country have involved dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1), there are not studies about its origin, genetic diversity and distribution. RESULTS: We used 224 bp corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of envelope (E) gene from 74 Colombian isolates in order to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and to estimate time divergences. Analyzed DENV-1 Colombian isolates belonged to the formerly defined genotype V. Only one virus isolate was clasified in the genotype I, likely representing a sole introduction that did not spread. The oldest strains were closely related to those detected for the first time in America in 1977 from the Caribbean and were detected for two years until their disappearance about six years later. Around 1987, a split up generated 2 lineages that have been evolving separately, although not major aminoacid changes in the analyzed region were found. CONCLUSION: DENV-1 has been circulating since 1978 in Colombia. Yet, the phylogenetic relationships between strains isolated along the covered period of time suggests that viral strains detected in some years, although belonging to the same genotype V, have different recent origins corresponding to multiple re-introduction events of viral strains that were circulating in neighbor countries. Viral strains used in the present study did not form a monophyletic group, which is evidence of a polyphyletic origin. We report the rapid spread patterns and high evolution rate of the different DENV-1 lineages.","publish_time":"2010-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mendez, Jairo A; Usme-Ciro, Jose A; Domingo, Cristina; Rey, Gloria J; Sanchez, Juan A; Tenorio, Antonio; Gallego-Gomez, Juan C","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a776acb66d26bc9ad550cb9909e0f1ef35b57fec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2944171.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20836894/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Colombia","America","Caribbean"],"keyphrases":["different DENV","oldest strains","years","multiple re-introduction events of viral strains","virus isolate","dengue virus serotype","Colombian isolates","defined genotype","phylogenetic relationships","genotype V","time divergences","lineages","important viral re-emergent diseases","sub-tropical countries","covered period of time","sole introduction","Dengue Fever","analyzed region","neighbor countries","polyphyletic origin","different recent origins","major aminoacid changes","rapid spread patterns","major public health concern","high evolution rate","country","order","carboxyl terminus of envelope","present study","evidence","people","world","monophyletic group","bp","genetic diversity","distribution","huge outbreaks","BACKGROUND","Caribbean","America","disappearance","RESULTS","serotypes","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

DATA SOURCES Literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were conducted on April 19, 2020, to include articles written in English that reported the prevalence of olfactory or gustatory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. REVIEW METHODS Search strategies developed for each database contained keywords such as anosmia, dysgeusia, and COVID-19. Resulting articles were imported into a systematic review software and underwent screening. Data from articles that met inclusion criteria were extracted and analyzed. Meta-analysis using pooled prevalence estimates in a random-effects model were calculated. RESULTS Ten studies were analyzed for olfactory dysfunction (n = 1627), demonstrating 52.73% (95% CI, 29.64%-75.23%) prevalence among patients with COVID-19. Nine studies were analyzed for gustatory dysfunction (n = 1390), demonstrating 43.93% (95% CI, 20.46%-68.95%) prevalence. Subgroup analyses were conducted for studies evaluating olfactory dysfunction using nonvalidated and validated instruments and demonstrated 36.64% (95% CI, 18.31%-57.24%) and 86.60% (95% CI, 72.95%-95.95%) prevalence, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Olfactory and gustatory dysfunction are common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and may represent early symptoms in the clinical course of infection. Increased awareness of this fact may encourage earlier diagnosis and treatment, as well as heighten vigilance for viral transmission.

However, chronic communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis persist worldwide. Furthermore, emerging new infections such as H1N1 influenza pose a new threat to public health. However, most studies have focused on non-communicable diseases because of their increasing incidence, with fewer studies investigating communicable diseases. Therefore, we estimated the burden of communicable diseases in Korea using national representative 2012 data. To estimate the disability-adjusted life years (DALY), we used cause of death data from the Statistics Korea to estimate the years of life lost (YLL), applied the Korean garbage code algorithm, and used national claims data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) to estimate years lived with disability (YLD). In 2012, the total DALYs of communicable disease were 445 per 100,000, with 129 YLLs per 100,000 and 316 YLDs per 100,000. The total DALYs in men were 468 per 100,000, greater than the 422 per 100,000 DALYs seen in women. The DALYs of lower respiratory infections were the highest value among communicable diseases at 143/100,000 DALYs followed by tuberculosis and upper respiratory infections. The 40-49 years old age group had the largest number of total DALYs. In contrast, the over 80 years old age group had the largest number of total DALYs per 100,000 followed by the 70-79 and 0-9 years old age groups.

Several studies indicate that these densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on traffic could increase the potential spread of COVID-19. This study investigated the association between changes in traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. Methods This study analyzed the daily national traffic and traffic trend for 3 months from January 1st, 2020. Traffic data was measured by the 6,307 vehicle detection system (VDS). This study analyzed the traffic gap between 2019 and 2020. And non-linear regression was performed to analyze the change in traffic trend in 2020. The relationship between traffic and COVID-19 confirmed cases was analyzed using single linear regression. Results The mean daily nationwide in 2020 was 143,655,563 vehicles, which was 9.7% lower than the same period in 2019 (159,044,566 vehicles). All regions showed a decreasing trend for traffic in February, which shifted to an increasing trend from March. In Incheon, there only was a positive but insignificant (\u03B2 = 43,146, p = .056) linear relationship with the increasing numbers of new confirmed cases associated with increased traffic. Conclusions New confirmed COVID-19 patients have been decreasing since March, while the traffic has been increasing. Particularly, the fact that traffic is increasing indicates greater contact between people, which in turn increases the risk of COVID-19 spread. Therefore, the government will need to devise suitable policies, such as total social distancing.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Hocheol; Park, Sung Jong; Lee, Ga Ram; Kim, Ji Eon; Lee, Ji Ho; Jung, Yeseul; Nam, Eun Woo","journal":"International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c90f0c81cba97cfa42af1aa6fbd1442be48d1bba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220303398?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.05.031; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220303398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417247/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["traffic trend","traffic volume","increased traffic","Traffic data","traffic gap","daily national traffic","increasing trend","potential spread of COVID","risk of COVID","study","decreasing trend","Conclusions New confirmed COVID","increasing numbers of new confirmed cases","linear relationship","vehicles","single linear regression","non-linear regression","heavy dependence","populated urban environments","changes","suitable policies","Abstract Objective World Health Organization","turn","greater contact","association","patients","total social distancing","vehicle detection system","VDS","people","Methods","regions","months","South Korea","government","studies","period","fact","Incheon","pandemic","mean"],"language":"en"},

Previously, it was demonstrated that passive immunization by providing hyperimmune egg yolk through the feed reduces Campylobacter jejuni colonization in broilers. Campylobacteriosis is the most commonly reported bacterial foodborne zoonosis worldwide, and poultry products are the number one origin of these bacteria for human infection. To date, no effective control measures exist to limit Campylobacter colonization in the chicken\u0027s intestinal tract. Here, the effect of lyophilization of hyperimmune egg yolk on protection of broilers against C. jejuni was investigated. During an in vivo trial, broiler chickens were prophylactically given feed with lyophilized hyperimmune or non-immunized egg yolk powder starting from day 1 after hatch. At day 11, broilers were inoculated with C. jejuni according to a seeder model. Five days later, all broilers were euthanized and cecal content was examined for C. jejuni colonization. No decrease in C. jejuni colonization was found. The freeze-drying resulted in a 16-fold decrease of the antibody titer in the yolk powder compared to the fresh yolks, presumably caused by structural changes in the antibodies. In conclusion, applying freeze-dried hyperimmune egg yolk failed to protect broilers against C. jejuni colonization, possibly because lyophilization affected the antibodies\u0027 functionality.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vandeputte, Jasmien; Martel, An; Antonissen, Gunther; Verlinden, Marc; De Zutter, Lieven; Heyndrickx, Marc; Haesebrouck, Freddy; Pasmans, Frank; Garmyn, An","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bf5937b44288e2aa1a099fe696fe8ade64f5c1e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102654.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32241501/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119580555; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.11.054; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119580555","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Campylobacter jejuni colonization","freeze-dried hyperimmune egg yolk","Campylobacter colonization","protection of broilers","non-immunized egg yolk powder","lyophilized hyperimmune","feed","effect of lyophilization","fold decrease","Abstract Oral administration of antibodies","promising strategy","origin","poultry products","antibody titer","effective control measures","fresh yolks","various infectious diseases","bacterial foodborne zoonosis","number","chicken\u0027s intestinal tract","passive immunization","conclusion","structural changes","broiler chickens","cecal content","human infection","date","trial","antibodies\u0027 functionality","hatch","seeder model","Campylobacteriosis","freeze-drying","days"],"language":"en"},

PSM research using scenarios aligns with Corley and Gioia\u2019s (2011) call for prescience-oriented research in which academics aim for more impactful research, enhancing sense-giving potential and theoretical relevance to practice to better perform their adaptive role in society.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Knight, Louise; Meehan, Joanne; Tapinos, Efstathios; Menzies, Laura; Pfeiffer, Alexandra","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2a7b8f5a32b86a548153a01540abde647d354207.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1478409220300777; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1478409220300777?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gioia"],"organizations":["PSM"],"locations":["Corley"],"keyphrases":["PSM research","future research","future of PSM","prior research","PSM academics","impactful research","PSM context","PSM scholars","important research opportunities","criteria of research quality","prescience-oriented research","practitioners","developing scenarios","profession","implications present new","value of scenario planning","methodology","complex interaction of macro-environmental factors","assumptions","sense","rigour","incremental thinking","units","change","significance","markets","sectors","levels of analysis","potential","originality","identification of uncertainties","leaders","Corley","ABSTRACT Drawing","significant blind spots","theoretical relevance","discipline","Gioia\u2019s"],"language":"en"},

Recent work has shown using B lymphoma cells that infection by Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and expression of its latent membrane protein (LMP)-1, cause increases in the expression of \u03B2-catenin and cellular transformation. Conversely, results from cell-based small molecule screening studies have shown that the antibiotic hexachlorophene can down-regulate \u03B2-catenin in colon cancer cells. Here we report that hexachlorophene also counteracts the elevated \u03B2-catenin levels in EBV-infected B lymphomas. This is associated with restoration in levels of Siah-1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is active in \u03B2-catenin regulation) which had been diminished by LMP-1. Our results suggest that Siah-1 is targeted by both LMP-1 and hexachlorophene with opposite effects. The hexachlorophene modulation of Siah-1 and \u03B2-catenin is independent of p53 and results in reduced expression of cyclin-D1 and c-Myc (target genes of \u03B2-catenin), leading to the growth arrest of B lymphoma cells. From these results we propose that hexachlorophene may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for EBV-infected B lymphoma cells by reducing \u03B2-catenin levels via the restoration of Siah-1.","publish_time":"2009-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Min, Hye-Jin; Cho, Il-Rae; Srisuttee, Ratakorn; Park, Eun-Hee; Cho, Dae Ho; Ahn, Jin-Hyun; Lee, Im-Soon; Johnston, Randal N.; Oh, Sangtaek; Chung, Young-Hwa","journal":"Cancer Letters","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f922896f5ca5faf171912e7fda57cf1f631dd87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116996.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304383508008707; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304383508008707; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2008.10.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19091460/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["\u03B2-catenin regulation","expression of \u03B2","elevated \u03B2-catenin levels","activation of \u03B2","results","levels of Siah","target genes of \u03B2","EBV-infected B lymphoma cells","hexachlorophene modulation of Siah","antibiotic hexachlorophene","restoration of Siah","LMP","growth arrest of B lymphoma cells","EBV-infected B lymphomas","colon cancer cells","reduced expression of cyclin","small molecule screening studies","Epstein","D1","c-Myc","infection","novel therapeutic strategy","Barr virus","independent of p53","E3 ubiquitin ligase","latent membrane protein","cause increases","Recent work","cellular transformation","opposite effects","oncogenesis","agents","pathway"],"language":"en"},

Objectives This study evaluated the performance of the Altona RealStar HEV RNA kit for detecting and quantifying HEV in faeces. Study design RNA was extracted from 94 stool samples by two methods: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit and MagNA Pure 96 automate. The Altona results were compared to a reference laboratory-developed accredited ISO15189 RT-PCR assay. Results The Altona and reference assays detect HEV RNA in 77/93 (82.8%) and 83/93 (89.2%) of the QIAamp extracted samples, respectively, after exclusion of invalid result; they detected HEV RNA in 67/92 (72.8%) and 66/92 (71.7%) of the MagNA Pure extracted samples, respectively, which emphasizes the importance of the RNA extraction method. The HEV RNA concentrations obtained with Altona RT-PCR and the reference RT-PCR were well correlated whatever the extraction method, and Bland Altman analyses indicated that the Altona values were higher than the reference assay values. The Altona values for QIAamp-extracted and MagNA Pure-extracted HEV RNA were very similar. Conclusions The Altona RealStar assay is suitable for quantifying HEV RNA in the faeces and monitoring HEV RNA shedding during ribavirin therapy.

Initially, the epicenter of H1N1 in the United States was in the New York area. Our hospital, like others, was inundated with large numbers of patients who presented at the Emergency Department (ED) with influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) for swine influenza testing and evaluation. Methods The Winthrop-University Hospital ED used rapid influenza (QuickVue A/B) tests to screen for H1N1 infection. Patients who were rapid influenza A test-positive were also reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for H1N1. In our ED, 30% of patients with ILIs and possible H1N1 pneumonia had negative rapid influenza A screening tests. Because H1N1 RT-PCR testing was restricted, there was no laboratory test to confirm or rule out H1N1. Other rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs), e.g., the respiratory fluorescent antibody (FA) viral panel test, were used to identify H1N1 patients with negative RIDTs. Results Unfortunately, there was not a good correlation between RIDT results and RT-PCR results. There was a critical need to develop a clinical syndromic approach for diagnosing hospitalized adults with probable H1N1 pneumonia with negative RIDTs. Early in the pandemic, the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division developed a diagnostic weighted point score system to diagnose H1N1 pneumonia clinically in RIDT-negative adults. The point score system worked well, but was time-consuming. As the \u201Cherald wave\u201D of the pandemic progressed, our ED staff needed a rapid, simplified method to diagnose probable H1N1 pneumonia in hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs. A rapid and simplified diagnosis was based on the diagnostic weighted point score system, which we simplified into a triad of key, nonspecific laboratory indicators. In adults hospitalized with an ILI, a fever \u003E102\u00B0F with severe myalgias, and a chest x-ray without focal segmental/lobar infiltrates, the presence of three indicators, i.e., otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, elevated serum transaminases, and an elevated creatinine phosphokinase, constituted the diagnostic swine influenza triad. The Infectious Disease Division\u0027s diagnostic swine flu triad was used effectively as the pandemic progressed, and was not only useful in correctly diagnosing probable H1N1 pneumonia in hospitalized adults with negative RIDTs, but was also in ruling out mimics of swine influenza, e.g., exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, asthma, or congestive heart failure, as well as bacterial community-acquired pneumonias (CAPs), e.g., legionnaire\u0027s disease. Conclusion Clinicians can use the Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division\u0027s Diagnostic swine influenza triad to make a rapid clinical diagnosis of probable H1N1 pneumonia in hospitalized adult patients with negative RIDTs.","publish_time":"2010-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cunha, Burke A.; Syed, Uzma; Mickail, Nardeen; Strollo, Stephanie","journal":"Heart \u0026 Lung","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f344bb5c8ad86b9d68ae79293a4bb811e33dd38e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112666.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20109989/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2009.10.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147956309002386; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147956309002386","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs4OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["RIDT","Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division"],"locations":["Mexico","United States","New York"],"keyphrases":["H1N1 patients","H1N1 pandemic","negative rapid influenza","epicenter of H1N1","H1N1 infection","possible H1N1 pneumonia","negative RIDTs","rapid influenza diagnostic tests","rapid clinical diagnosis of probable H1N1 pneumonia","swine influenza testing","H1N1 RT-PCR testing","mimics of swine influenza","hospitalized adults","RIDT-negative adults","Winthrop-University Hospital Infectious Disease Division\u0027s Diagnostic swine influenza triad","hospitalized adult patients","Infectious Disease Division\u0027s diagnostic swine flu triad","Winthrop-University Hospital ED","diagnostic weighted point score system","RT-PCR results","legionnaire\u0027s disease","triad of key","test-positive","ED staff","simplified diagnosis","RIDT results","laboratory test","large numbers of patients","ILIs","United States","screening tests","simplified method","herald wave","viral panel test","nonspecific laboratory indicators","elevated serum transaminases","clinical syndromic approach","elevated creatinine phosphokinase","chest x-ray","reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","asthma","lobar infiltrates","unexplained relative lymphopenia","QuickVue","respiratory fluorescent antibody","congestive heart failure","CAPs","exacerbations of chronic bronchitis","Mexico","illnesses","bacterial community","severe myalgias","presence","good correlation","Emergency Department","Methods","New York area","critical need","fever","pneumonias","spring","evaluation","Conclusion Clinicians"],"language":"en"},

This project was conducted to determine whether negative-pressure isolation for multiple patients can be achieved quickly and effectively using general hospital space not previously dedicated to respiratory isolation. Methods The physical therapy gymnasium was the area designated to test the ability to create a negative-pressure isolation environment in a large space. The conversion was planned in advance of an unscheduled drill to convert the space. Four high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtered forced air machines were used to generate negative pressure. The units were vented to the outside air by a 25-foot length of 10-inch-diameter reusable duct. We evaluated the time needed for equipment setup and room conversion and noted any subjective difficulty with either setup or operation of the equipment. We measured the ability of the equipment to generate a negative air pressure relative to adjacent areas and determined the noise levels created during the use of different combinations of machines at various power settings. Results After drill activation and the request for equipment setup, 1 hour was required to convert the physical therapy gymnasium into an operational negative-pressure environment. The room pressure readings \u201Chigh\u201D power ranged from \u22121.5 to \u221213 Pa (\u22120.006 to \u22120.052 inches of water), and noise levels ranged from 70 to 76 dB. Calculated air changes per hour using 1, 2, 3, or 4 units running simultaneously at \u201Chigh\u201D power were 4.1, 8.2, 12.3, and 16.4, respectively. Using 4 units at once running at \u201Clow\u201D power setting yielded 8.2 air changes per hour and generated a room pressure reading of \u22128.0 Pa, or \u22120.032 inches of water. Conclusion Portable HEPA filtered forced air units are an effective means of creating large patient care areas with the negative-pressure environment required for respiratory isolation. This design results in a significantly lower-cost alternative compared with construction of individual rooms or units with similar capability and can be retrofitted to existing space. This type of unit would allow treatment of many more patients than current hospital capability would permit and would be an important asset in meeting the needs created by bioterrorism or a naturally occurring epidemic.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosenbaum, Robert A.; Benyo, Jeffrey S.; O\u0027Connor, Robert E.; Passarello, Brent A.; Williams, Daniel R.; Humphrey, Brian D.; Ross, Robert W.; Berry, James M.; Krebs, Jeffrey G.","journal":"Annals of Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/46c9bd4aa92ac01a99efa2f82e2e6c105fcdd078.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118873.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064404002793; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064404002793","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["negative pressure","negative air pressure relative","negative-pressure isolation environment","forced air units","operational negative-pressure environment","outside air","room pressure readings","respiratory isolation","forced air machines","equipment setup","Calculated air changes","high-efficiency particulate air","hour","large space","room conversion","existing space","general hospital space","physical therapy gymnasium","multiple patients","various power settings","noise levels","inches of water","large patient care areas","Study objective Patients","current hospital capability","adjacent areas","similar capability","drill activation","unscheduled drill","design results","health care workers","Conclusion Portable HEPA","use of different combinations of machines","effective means","construction of individual rooms","communicable diseases","request","chance of transmission","lower-cost alternative","subjective difficulty","treatment","foot length","inch-diameter reusable duct","needs","public","advance","Methods","time","bioterrorism","important asset","type of unit","epidemic","dB","project"],"language":"en"},

The UPS is reportedly downregulated in various neurodegenerative disorders, with increased proteasome activity shown to be beneficial in many related disease models. Proteasomes function under tonic inhibitory conditions, possibly via the ubiquitin chain-trimming function of USP14, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). We identified three specific RNA aptamers of USP14 (USP14-1, USP14-2, and USP14-3) that inhibited its deubiquitinating activity. The nucleotide sequences of these non-cytotoxic USP14 aptamers contained conserved GGAGG motifs, with G-rich regions upstream, and similar secondary structures. They efficiently elevated proteasomal activity, as determined by the increased degradation of small fluorogenic peptide substrates and physiological polyubiquitinated Sic1 proteins. Additionally, proteasomal degradation of tau proteins was facilitated in the presence of the UPS14 aptamers in vitro. Our results indicate that these novel inhibitory UPS14 aptamers can be used to enhance proteasome activity, and to facilitate the degradation of proteotoxic proteins, thereby protecting cells from various neurodegenerative stressors.","publish_time":"2015-06-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Jung Hoon; Shin, Seung Kyun; Jiang, Yanxialei; Choi, Won Hoon; Hong, Chaesun; Kim, Dong-Eun; Lee, Min Jae","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc5e4a2de7d202adad95ea3fe26625bdebe817cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4455164.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26041011/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep10757","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["function of USP14","degradation of proteotoxic proteins","increased proteasome activity","intracellular proteins","non-cytotoxic USP14 aptamers","specific RNA aptamers of USP14","deubiquitinating activity","proteasomal degradation of tau proteins","ubiquitin-proteasome system","elevated proteasomal activity","novel inhibitory UPS14 aptamers","physiological polyubiquitinated Sic1 proteins","various neurodegenerative disorders","various neurodegenerative stressors","increased degradation of small fluorogenic peptide substrates","Proteasomes function","ubiquitin chain","deubiquitinating enzyme","tonic inhibitory conditions","similar secondary structures","aggregation-prone structures","conserved GGAGG motifs","G-rich regions","transcription factors","primary mechanism","cells","nucleotide sequences","presence","related disease models","results","DUB"],"language":"en"},

The first case infected with H7N9 virus in Beijing involved a family member of a chicken dealer and was reported in April 2013. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of this case and her parents were examined to illustrate some key traits regarding this novel H7N9 virus. METHODS: The index case was subjected to intensive clinical examination in order to observed the clinical process. Real-time PCR was used to confirm cases infected with H7N9 virus. The index case was administered oseltamivir (45 mg, twice daily) at the early stage of the infection. Sera were collected from the index case and her parents from the onset of illness onwards. The subjects were followed for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The sera were confirmed by neutralizing antibody tests. The index case\u2019s clinical manifestation progressed quickly. The pharyngeal swab tested positive for influenza A based on the detection of influenza A antigen (rapid influenza diagnostic test) 15 h after the onset of fever and was positive for H7N9 virus. The patient\u2019s temperature dropped to 36.2 \u00B0C 18 h after treatment by oseltamivir (32 h after fever). Cough and other symptoms alleviated rapidly. A number of specimens from the environment of this cluster and from the feces specimens tested positive for viral RNA of the H7N9 virus on the fourth day following onset of the index case\u2019s illness. Pharyngeal swabs of the mother tested positive for H7N9 virus twice, but she showed no clinical symptoms. Four weeks after disease onset, the family did not present any clinical symptoms, and the results of the physical examination and blood tests were normal. The mother and the case\u2019s sera had a fourfold increased neutralizing antibody titer. CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis and early initiation of the treatment of confirmed infections is the most effective strategy for managing H7N9 virus infection. Human beings exposed to H7N9 virus may develop asymptomatic infection.","publish_time":"2013-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, R.; Pang, X.; Yang, P.; Shu, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, Q.; Chen, Z.; Liu, J.; Cheng, J.; Jiao, Y.; Jiang, R.; Lu, L.; Chen, L.; Ma, J.; Li, C.; Zeng, H.; Peng, X.; Huang, L.; Zheng, Y.; Deng, Y.; Li, X.","journal":"Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f33c5ab9f64e046ed247d8db9984349cd24a2a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102393.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102393/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["H7N9 virus infection","novel H7N9 virus","clinical symptoms","index case\u2019s clinical manifestation","clinical process","index case\u2019s illness","case\u2019s sera","intensive clinical examination","onset of fever","onset of illness","avian influenza","detection of influenza","disease onset","early initiation","Early diagnosis","Human infections","treatment of confirmed infections","early stage","oseltamivir","parents","mother","antibody tests","RESULTS","asymptomatic infection","weeks","rapid influenza diagnostic test","family member","physical examination","feces specimens","blood tests","number of specimens","Human beings","Pharyngeal swabs","fourfold increased neutralizing antibody titer","antigen","viral RNA","effective strategy","order","Beijing","day","key traits","cluster","CONCLUSION","PURPOSE","cases","epidemiological characteristics","environment","chicken dealer","Real-time PCR","patient\u2019s temperature","METHODS","China","subjects","Cough"],"language":"en"},

There are no sequence or structure requirements to encapsidate single-stranded nucleic acid cargo. In this work, we wanted to determine how the length of the cargo impacts the stability and structure of the assembled CLPs. We hypothesized that cargo neutralizes the basic region of the alphavirus capsid protein and if the cargo is long enough, it will also act to scaffold the CP monomers together. Experimentally we found that CLPs encapsidating short 27mer oligonucleotides were less stable than CLPs encapsidating 48mer or 90mer oligonucleotides under different chemical and thermal conditions. Furthermore, cryo-EM studies showed there were structural differences between CLPs assembled with 27mer and 48mer cargo. To mimic the role of the cargo in CLP assembly we made a mutant (4D) where we substituted a cluster of four Lys residues in the CP with four Asp residues. We found that these few amino acid substitutions were enough to initiate CLP assembly in the absence of cargo. The cargo-free 4D CLPs show higher resistance to ionic strength and increased temperature compared to wild-type cargo containing CLPs suggesting their CLP assembly mechanism might also be different.","publish_time":"2017-12-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rayaprolu, Vamseedhar; Moore, Alan; Wang, Joseph Che-Yen; Goh, Boon Chong; Perilla, Juan R; Zlotnick, Adam; Mukhopadhyay, Suchetana","journal":"J Phys Condens Matter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a7db2b9578b0fe1eb9a77e67d0deee30def9f89.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103146.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103146/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzQ3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CLP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mer cargo","cargo-free","absence of cargo","polyanionic cargo","assembled CLPs","nucleic acid cargo","wild-type cargo","mer oligonucleotides","CLPs encapsidating short","CLP assembly mechanism","assembly of alphavirus nucleocapsid cores","different chemical","structure requirements","Lys residues","Asp residues","CP monomers","alphavirus capsid protein","amino acid substitutions","higher resistance","increased temperature","ionic strength","encapsidate single","basic region","stability","thermal conditions","structural differences","sequence","cryo-EM studies","cluster","particles","mutant","role","length","work"],"language":"en"},

Specialized fluorescent probes can benefit the study of interactions within viruses, especially during cell studies. In this work, we developed a strategy based on F\u00F6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study the assembly of viruses without labeling the exterior of viruses. Instead, we exploit their encapsulation of nucleic cargo, using three different fluorescent ATTO dyes linked to single-stranded DNA oligomers, which are hybridised to a longer DNA strand. FRET is induced upon assembly of the cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, which forms monodisperse icosahedral particles of about 22 nm, thereby increasing the FRET efficiency by a factor of 8. Additionally, encapsulation of the dyes in virus-like particles induces a two-step FRET. When the formed constructs are disassembled, this FRET signal is fully reduced to the value before encapsulation. This reversible behavior makes the system a good probe for studying viral assembly and disassembly. It, furthermore, shows that multi-component supramolecular materials are stabilized in the confinement of a protein cage.","publish_time":"2018-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Ruiter, Mark V; Overeem, Nico J; Singhai, Gaurav; Cornelissen, Jeroen J L M","journal":"J Phys Condens Matter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c526c8e6e3dc7759c4696106e4c5eb143163a8fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104908.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104908/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Specialized"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral assembly","disassembly of viruses","FRET signal","FRET efficiency","two-step FRET","exterior of viruses","encapsulation of nucleic cargo","different fluorescent ATTO dyes","viral diseases","icosahedral particles","study of interactions","Specialized fluorescent probes","longer DNA strand","cowpea chlorotic mottle virus","single-stranded DNA oligomers","good probe","crucial role","strategy","system","developing cures","F\u00F6rster resonance energy transfer","confinement","nm","multi-component supramolecular materials","reversible behavior","cell studies","formed constructs","protein cage","value","factor","Insight","work"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the study was to analyze viral coinfection and its relationship to clinical severity. METHODS: Hospitalized pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of respiratory infection were studied during the period between 2009 and 2010. Clinical and epidemiological data, duration of hospitalization, need for oxygen therapy, bacterial coinfection and need for mechanical ventilation were collected. Etiology was studied by multiplex PCR and low-density microarrays for 19 viruses. RESULTS: A total of 385 patients were positive, 44.94% under 12 months. The most frequently detected viruses were RSV-B: 139, rhinovirus: 114, RSV-A: 111, influenza A H1N1-2009: 93 and bocavirus: 77. Coinfection was detected in 61.81%, 36.36% with two viruses, 16.10% and 9.35% with three to four or more. Coinfection was higher in 2009 with 69.79 vs 53.88% in 2010. Rhinovirus/RSV-B on 10 times and RSV-A/RSV-B on five times were the most detected coinfections. Hospitalization decreased with greater number of viruses (P\u003C.001). Oxygen therapy was required by 26.75% (one virus was detected in 55.34% of cases). A larger number of viruses resulted in less need for oxygen (P\u003C.001). Ten cases required mechanical ventilation, four patients with bacterial coinfection and five with viral coinfection (P=.69). CONCLUSIONS: An inverse relationship was found between the number of viruses detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate, the need for oxygen therapy and hospitalization days. More epidemiological studies and improved quantitative detection techniques are needed to define the role of viral coinfections in respiratory disease and its correlation with the clinical severity.","publish_time":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDnez-Roig, A.; Salvad\u00F3, M.; Caballero-Rabasco, M.A.; S\u00E1nchez-Buenavida, A.; L\u00F3pez-Segura, N.; Bonet-Alcaina, M.","journal":"Arch Bronconeumol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8179a15e73fbe20321358ee8992894bc9d101d0c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105245.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105245/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Rhinovirus"],"organizations":["RSV-A/RSV-B"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detected viruses","bacterial coinfection","RSV-B","need","oxygen therapy","detected coinfections","greater number of viruses","larger number of viruses","clinical severity","clinical diagnosis of respiratory infection","respiratory disease","pediatric patients","duration of hospitalization","role of viral coinfections","hospitalization days","times","mechanical ventilation","rhinovirus","cases","etiology of respiratory tract infections","introduction of molecular techniques","epidemiological studies","epidemiological data","inverse relationship","improved quantitative detection techniques","better understanding","nasopharyngeal aspirate","correlation","multiplex PCR","low-density microarrays","children","total","study","H1N1","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHODS","period","influenza","bocavirus","vs","months","objective"],"language":"en"},

This is a very ambitious goal, and one that has yet to be achieved. One approach is to shun the \u2018one size fits all\u2019 concept and to target pathogen-reduction agents at the Individual component types. This permits the development of technologies that might be compatible with, for example, plasma products but that would be cytocidal and thus incompatible with platelet concentrates or red blood cell units. The technologies to be discussed include solvent detergent and methylene blue treatments\u2014designed to inactivate plasma components and derivatives; psoralens (S-59\u2014amotosalen) designed to pathogen-reduce units of platelets; and two products aimed at red blood cells, S-303 (a Frale\u2014frangible anchor-linker effector compound) and Inactine (a binary ethyleneimine). A final pathogen-reduction material that might actually allow one material to inactivate all three blood components\u2014riboflavin (vitamin B2)\u2014is also under development. The sites of action of the amotosalen (S-59), the S-303 Frale, Inactine, and riboflavin are all localized in the nucleic acid part of the pathogen. Solvent detergent materials act by dissolving the plasma envelope, thus compromising the integrity of the pathogen membrane and rendering it non-infectious. By disrupting the pathogen\u0027s ability to replicate or survive, its infectivity is removed. The degree to which bacteria and viruses are affected by a particular pathogen-reducing technology relates to its Gram-positive or Gram-negative status, to the sporulation characteristics for bacteria, and the presence of lipid or protein envelopes for viruses. Concerns related to photoproducts and other breakdown products of these technologies remain, and the toxicology of pathogen-reduction treatments is a major ongoing area of investigation. Clearly, regulatory agencies have a major role to play in the evaluation of these new technologies. This chapter will cover the several types of pathogen-reduction systems, mechanisms of action, the inactivation efficacy for specific types of pathogens, toxicology of the various systems and the published research and clinical trial data supporting their potential usefulness. Due to the nature of the field, pathogen reduction is a work in progress and this review should be considered as a snapshot in time rather than a clear picture of what the future will bring.","publish_time":"2005-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pelletier, J.P.R.; Transue, S.; Snyder, E.L.","journal":"Best Pract Res Clin Haematol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106341.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106341/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogen reduction","toxicology of pathogen","pathogen-reduction agents","pathogen membrane","particular pathogen","final pathogen-reduction material","development of technologies","reduction treatments","reduction systems","blood components","red blood cells","plasma products","new technologies","blood supply of pathogens","plasma components","red blood cell units","specific types of pathogens","plasma envelope","Individual component types","Inactine","Frale","breakdown products","viruses","riboflavin","bacteria","amotosalen","various systems","mechanisms of action","major role","Solvent detergent materials act","sites of action","units of platelets","ambitious goal","methylene blue treatments","toxic chemical agents","major ongoing area of investigation","clinical trial data","published research","inactivation efficacy","frangible anchor-linker effector compound","presence of lipid","work","psoralens","Gram-negative status","sporulation characteristics","vitamin B2","potential usefulness","protein envelopes","technology","evaluation","cytocidal","integrity","derivatives","concept","progress","field","clear picture","time","snapshot","review","regulatory agencies","photoproducts","example","nature","eradication","binary ethyleneimine","nucleic acid","future","size fits","Concerns","degree","desire","pathogen\u0027s ability","chapter","approach","infectivity"],"language":"en"},

Turkey SSTs were dissected from freshly obtained uterovaginal junction (UVJ) tissue and placed in explant culture on various substrates and media. Primary cultures of SST epithelium only survived and grew from SST explants that were cultured on inactivated Sandoz inbred strain, thioguanine- and ouabain-resistance (STO) mouse feeder-cell layers in 12% fetal bovine serum-supplemented Dulbecco\u0027s Modified Eagle Medium mixed 1:1 with F12 nutrient mixture. Three independent primary colonies gave rise to 3 finite cell lines, SST-1, -2, and -3, which were continuously cultured for 8 to 16 passages at 1:3 passage ratios over a period of 3 to 4 mo. The cells were passaged by pretreatment with Y27632 and dissociation with Accutase. The SST cells grew as tightly knit monolayers on top of the feeder cells at a slow rate (approximately 96 h doubling time) at a medium pH of approximately 6.9. Lipid vacuoles were visible by light microscopy in the cells particularly at the periphery of growth. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the cells to be a polarized epithelium with apical microvilli and to have lateral tight-junction-like unions and associated desmosomes. Numerous secretory vesicles filled the upper portion of the cells\u2019 cytoplasm, and nuclei and other major organelles such as mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus were distributed somewhat lower in the cytoplasm. The secretory vesicles resembled mucin secretory vesicles.

Adequate caloric intake can improve weight gain, but has little effect on height velocity and lean body mass (Henderson et al. 1994, Miller et al. 1992). Long-term survivors with HIV infection are shorter than anticipated, and these changes cannot be explained solely by inadequate nutrition or by endocrine abnormalities.

We report the incidence and impact of cases of SARS imported to Singapore between 25 February and 31 May 2003, and describe national measures to prevent further importation. METHODS: Information on imported cases of SARS and measures taken at entry points to Singapore was retrieved from the Ministry of Health and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. RESULTS: Of the 6 imported cases, which all occurred before screening measures were implemented at the airport, only the first resulted in extensive secondary transmission. Of 442,973 air passengers screened after measures were implemented, 136 were sent to a designated hospital for further SARS screening; none was diagnosed as having SARS. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS outbreak in Singapore can be traced to the first imported case. The absence of transmission from the other imported cases was probably a result of relatively prompt identification and isolation of cases, together with a low potential for transmission. New imported SARS cases therefore need not lead to major outbreaks if systems are in place to identify and isolate them early. Screening at entry points is costly, has a low yield and is not sufficient in itself, but may be justified in light of the major economic, social and international impact which even a single imported SARS case may have.","publish_time":"2006-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Goh, Kee Tai; Paton, Nicholas I","journal":"J Travel Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/152b9f61013ab57a8a696b2cdbdd696dea14a941.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107530/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore"],"locations":["Hong Kong","Vietnam","Singapore"],"keyphrases":["imported cases of SARS","New imported SARS cases","SARS screening","importation of SARS","SARS outbreak","single imported SARS case","impact of cases","isolation of cases","screening measures","national measures","major outbreaks","Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore","entry points","absence of transmission","extensive secondary transmission","international impact","low yield","low potential","new disease","Canada","Vietnam","Hong Kong","time","Ministry of Health","prompt identification","Information","light","systems","place","designated hospital","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","incidence","air passengers","airport","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia, making diagnosis difficult. Hematological and biochemical abnormalities, particularly lymphopenia, are common in patients with SARS. Methods. With the use of 2 databases, we compared the ability of the absolute lymphocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, lactate dehydrogenase level, creatine kinase level, alanine aminotransferase level, and serum calcium level at hospital admission to discriminate between cases of SARS and cases of community-acquired pneumonia. The SARS database contained data for 144 patients with SARS from the 2003 Toronto SARS outbreak. The community-acquired pneumonia database contained data for 8044 patients with community-acquired pneumonia from Edmonton, Canada. Patients from the SARS database were matched to patients from the community-acquired pneumonia database according to age, and receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each laboratory variable. Results. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) demonstrated fair to poor discriminatory ability for all laboratory variables tested except absolute neutrophil count, which had an AUC of 0.80, indicating good discriminatory ability (although there was no cutoff value of the absolute neutrophil count at which reasonable sensitivity or specificity could be obtained). Combinations of any 2 tests did not perform significantly better than did the absolute neutrophil count alone. Conclusions. Routine laboratory tests, including determination of absolute lymphocyte count, should not be used in the diagnosis of SARS or incorporated into current case definitions of SARS. The role of the absolute neutrophil count in SARS diagnosis is likely limited, but it should be assessed further.","publish_time":"2005-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muller, Matthew P.; Tomlinson, George; Marrie, Thomas J.; Tang, Patrick; McGeer, Allison; Low, Donald E.; Detsky, Allan S.; Gold, Wayne L.","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3ed733a3ab1038472d3cc38d221e8944f73279b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107805.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107805/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzcxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Edmonton","Canada"],"keyphrases":["SARS database","diagnosis of SARS","SARS diagnosis","absolute neutrophil count","cases of SARS","patients","pneumonia database","determination of absolute lymphocyte count","Toronto SARS outbreak","cases of community","current case definitions of SARS","etiologies of community","creatine kinase level","lactate dehydrogenase level","alanine aminotransferase level","serum calcium level","laboratory variables","characteristic curves","poor discriminatory ability","good discriminatory ability","receiver","Routine laboratory tests","diagnosis difficult","AUCs","clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome","hospital admission","lymphopenia","age","reasonable sensitivity","cutoff value","biochemical abnormalities","specificity","areas","Edmonton","role","databases","Canada","use","Combinations","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The high prevalence of viral and mixed viral-bacterial infections supports the notion that the presence of a virus, acting either as a direct or an indirect pathogen, may be the rule rather than the exception in the development of CAP in school-age children requiring hospitalization.","publish_time":"2004-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsolia, M.

This hypothesis should be evaluated by using administrative databases to search for reduced rates of hospitalization and death due to influenza-related conditions among people taking statins. These studies should be followed by laboratory studies of statins in animal and cell-based models of influenza virus infection and, later, by clinical trials. Positive results from such studies would provide physicians in all countries with something to offer patients for treatment and prophylaxis of pandemic influenza.

Method Doctors and nurses were encouraged to participate. The survey consisted of self-report measures: demographics, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 28 and Impact of Events Scale (IES). A questionnaire enquiring about changes in life\u0027s priorities due to SARS and circumstances that helped with coping was used. Participation was strictly voluntary and responses anonymous. Results In total 177 out of 661 (27%) participants [40 out of 113 (35%) doctors and 137 out of 544 (25%) nurses] had a GHQ 28 score \u22655. Doctors [P = 0.026, odds ratio (OR) = 1.6 and 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1\u20132.5] and single health care workers were at higher risk (P = 0.048, OR = 1.4 and 95% CI = 1.02\u20132.0) compared to nurses and those who were married. Approximately 20% of the participants had IES scores \u226530, indicating the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Four areas were classified as more important using factor analysis: health and relationship with the family, relationship with friends/colleagues, work and spiritual. The areas for coping strategies were clear directives/precautionary measures, ability to give feedback to/obtain support from management, support from supervisors/colleagues, support from the family, ability to talk to someone and religious convictions. Support from supervisors/colleagues was a significant negative predictor for psychiatric symptoms and PTSD. Work and clear communication of directives/precautionary measures also helped reduce psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions Many health care workers were emotionally affected and traumatized during the SARS outbreak. Hence, it is important for health care institutions to provide psychosocial support and intervention for their health care workers.","publish_time":"2004-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Angelina O.

We aimed to investigate the potential role of vernakalant for facilitated electrical cardioversion in cardioversion-resistant AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: The subjects of this study were 63 patients referred to the Heart Centre Leipzig between November 2011 and May 2014 for transthoracic electrical cardioversion of AF. All patients experienced after antiarrhythmic-na\u00EFve electrical cardioversion either IRAF (n = 44; 70%) or FECV (n = 19; 30%). After drug infusion, electrical cardioversion was successful in 66.7% of vernakalant-treated as opposed to 46.7% of amiodarone-treated patients (P = 0.109). Multivariate analysis revealed treatment with vernakalant (OR 0.057, 95% CI 0.006\u20130.540, P = 0.013), treatment with ACEI or ARB (OR 0.101, 95% CI 0.015\u20130.691 P = 0.019), and IRAF after initial CV (OR 0.047, 95% CI 0.004\u20130.498, P = 0.011) as predictors for successful, drug-facilitated electrical cardioversion. Subgroup analysis of 18 patients with previous AF ablation revealed a significantly higher success rate of electrical cardioversion after infusion of vernakalant than after infusion of amiodarone (66.7 vs. 11.1%, P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Vernakalant may therefore be considered as a useful agent for facilitated electrical cardioversion in cardioversion-resistant AF.","publish_time":"2015-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FCssigbrodt, Andreas; John, Silke; Kosiuk, Jedrzej; Richter, Sergio; Hindricks, Gerhard; Bollmann, Andreas","journal":"Europace","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e76bee644c4971b20d6693dc956afef90289388.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108474.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108474/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Heart Centre Leipzig","AF","ARB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transthoracic electrical cardioversion of AF","cardioversion-resistant AF","antiarrhythmic-na\u00EFve electrical cardioversion","higher success rate of electrical cardioversion","infusion of vernakalant","IRAF","previous AF ablation","immediate AF recurrence","amiodarone-treated patients","drug infusion","infusion of amiodarone","potential role of vernakalant","treatment","FECV","Subgroup analysis","Multivariate analysis","rhythm control strategy of atrial fibrillation","cornerstone","subjects","useful agent","RESULTS","Heart Centre Leipzig","study","ARB","initial CV","predictors","METHODS","ACEI","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

We also measured the mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 content and nonsteroidogenic enzymes specific for subcellular fractions. Mitochondria and microsomal fractions were isolated from the adrenals of 2-, 12-, and 18- month-old animals and used for various enzyme measurements. Mitochondrial side-chain cleavage enzyme activity (nanomoles per min mg protein(-1)) increased from a mean of 0.43 \u00B1 0.06 in 2-month-old rats to 1.26 \u00B1 0.11 and 1.51 \u00B1 0.06 in 12- and 18-month old rats, respectively.

Finally, mitochondrial 11\u03B2- hydroxylase was comparable in both age groups. In addition, activities of mitochondrial nonsteroidogenic enzymes, such as monoamine oxidase, amytal insensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, did not change with age.

The human counterpart is known as biliary glycoprotein (BGP) or CD66a. It is involved in different cellular functions ranging from intercellular adhesion, microbial receptor activity, signaling and tumor suppression. In the present study N-glyco-sylation of C-CAM immunopurified from rat liver was analyzed in detail. The primary sequence of rat C-CAM contains 15 potential N-glycosylation sites. The N-glycans were enzymatically released from glycopeptides, fluorescently labeled with 2-aminobenzamide, and separated by two-dimensional HPLC. Oligosaccharide structures were characterized by enzymatic sequencing and MALDI-TOF-MS. Mainly bi- and triantennary complex structures were identified. The presence of type I and type II chains in the antennae of these glycans results in heterogeneous glycosylation of C-CAM. Sialylation of the sugars was found to be unusual; bi- and triantennary glycans contained three and four sialic acid residues, respectively, and this linkage seemed to be restricted to the type I chain in the antennae. Approximately 20% of the detected sugars contain these unusual numbers of sialic acids. C-CAM is the first transmembrane protein found to be over-sialylated.","publish_time":"1999-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kannicht, Christoph; Lucka, Lothar; Nuck, Rolf; Reutter, Werner; Gohlke, Martin","journal":"Glycobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6b3e84d82e68e49187b748983017cd3292c57653.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108558.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108558/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["primary sequence of rat C-CAM","N-glycans","heterogeneous glycosylation of C","triantennary glycans","glycans results","rat liver","antennae","presence of type","potential N-glycosylation sites","triantennary complex structures","intercellular adhesion","transmembrane protein","unusual numbers of sialic acids","present study N-glyco","Oligosaccharide structures","detected sugars","sialic acid residues","carcino-embryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule","microbial receptor activity","biliary glycoprotein","enzymatic sequencing","different cellular functions","MALDI-TOF","chains","tumor suppression","human counterpart","BGP","CD66a","aminobenzamide","two-dimensional HPLC","linkage","Sialylation","glycopeptides"],"language":"en"},

Whooping Cough and Parkinson\u0027 Disease. International Journal of Epidemiology 1996; 25: 1301\u20131311. BACKGROUND: We reported high levodopa use and prevalences of Parkinson\u0027s Disease (PD) in periodically, time-clustered, Icelandic cohorts born after major whooping cough epidemics (MWCE). METHODS: In order to quantify a possible relationship between age at first post-birth MWCE and risk of PD we: 1) calculated cumulative incidences of PD during the period 1954\u20131963 in one-year Icelandic cohorts born between 1869 and 1927, using raw material from a reported survey; 2) identified MWCE from 1869 onwards in Iceland; 3) estimated cohort ages at onset of incidence period and at first MWCE; and 4) combined the above-mentioned information using log-linear models. In addition, we studied the prevalence of levodopa users in Icelandic birth cohorts during a recent period. RESULTS: The curves of the above-mentioned incidences and prevalences in one-year birth-cohorts showed: 1) a similar, age-related, inverted V profile; and 2) a systematic notchy pattern, with peak values for one or both measurements for cohorts born during or after each of nine MWCE identified during the period 1869\u20131927. When 13 cohorts bom in years with MWCE were excluded from the analysis, the risk of PD rose with age at first defined MWCE, with the linear increase being 8.4% per year (95% Cl: \u22120.1\u201318.3%). CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with reported effects of age at exposure in animal models of toxic parkinsonism, age-related changes in the dopamine receptor-GPT-binding protein-adenylatecyclase system observed in rats treated with pertussis toxin, and some PD epidemiological features. They suggest that pertussis neurotoxicity could be causally related to PD worldwide.","publish_time":"1996-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"DE PEDRO-CUESTA, JES\u00DAS; GUDMUNDSSON, GRETAR; ABRAIRA, VICTOR; GUDMUNDSSON, GUNNAR; L\u014CVE, ARTHUR; TULINIUS, HRAFN; VEIGA, JORGE; ALMAZ\u00C1N, JAVIER; PETERSEN, INGOLF J","journal":"Int J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af14a06572f3f6ffcc708b2a121f398b11a0a5cc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108570/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sinesio Delgado"],"organizations":["Centro Nacional de Epidemiolog\u00EDa, Departamento de Epidemiolog\u00EDa Aplicada","Tulinius H, Veiga J","EUROPARKINSON Preparatory Activity Research Group","International Journal of Epidemiology","PD","MWCE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Icelandic birth cohorts","year birth-cohorts","year Icelandic cohorts","defined MWCE","risk of PD","post-birth MWCE","cohorts bom","cumulative incidences of PD","PD epidemiological features","Veiga J","Almaz\u00E1n J","recent period","reported effects of age","Gudmundsson G","Pedro-Cuesta J","above-mentioned incidences","onset of incidence period","reported survey","RESULTS","prevalences of Parkinson\u0027s Disease","log-linear models","Epidemiolog\u00EDa Aplicada","age-related changes","Abraira V","major whooping cough epidemics","above-mentioned information","linear increase","pertussis toxin","pertussis neurotoxicity","high levodopa use","prevalence of levodopa users","inverted V profile","animal models of toxic parkinsonism","L\u014Dve","exposure","Tulinius H","Petersen","dopamine receptor-GPT","Salud Carlos","binding protein-adenylatecyclase system","Sinesio Delgado","Centro Nacional","Instituto","Departamento","Madrid","Spain","EUROPARKINSON Preparatory Activity Research Group","peak values","rats","cohort ages","possible relationship","systematic notchy pattern","curves","time-clustered","order","BACKGROUND","raw material","measurements","years","analysis","International Journal of Epidemiology","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","addition"],"language":"en"},

Following infection with LDV, a strong activator of B cells, an early and transient IL-6 production was observed, that originated predominantly from macrophages. Whereas LDV-induced B lymphocyte proliferation appeared independent of IL-6, mice deficient for this cytokine showed a marked reduction in their total T-dependent IgG2a production when compared to their normal counterparts. By contrast, specific responses directed against either LDV or non-viral antigens administered at the time of infection were not decreased in the absence of IL-6. Similarly, polyclonal, but not anti-parasite IgG2a production triggered by T. gondii infection was strongly dependent on the presence of IL-6. Finally, T-independent total IgG3 secretion triggered by LPS was also markedly reduced in IL-6-deficient mice. These results suggest that IL-6 plays a major role in T-dependent and T-independent polyclonal Ig production following B lymphocyte activation by viruses, and parasites, but not in specific antibody responses induced by the same microorganisms.","publish_time":"2001-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Markine-Goriaynoff, Dominique; Nguyen, Trung D.; Bigaignon, Geoffroy; Van Snick, Jacques; Coutelier, Jean-Paul","journal":"Int Immunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108634.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108634/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzkwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["independent of IL","role of IL","transient IL","presence of IL","absence of IL","T-independent polyclonal Ig production","total T-dependent IgG2a production","LDV-induced B lymphocyte proliferation","gondii infection","anti-parasite IgG2a production","T-independent total IgG3 secretion","B lymphocyte activation","LPS","time of infection","specific responses","mice deficient","deficient mice","specific antibody responses","strong activator of B cells","Toxoplasma gondii","major role","lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus","mouse","parasites","marked reduction","viruses","non-viral antigens","cytokine","lipopolysaccharide","normal counterparts","microorganisms","contrast","results","macrophages"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Patients with stage I or II pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had undergone surgical resection (R0 or R1) received adjuvant gemcitabine with TG01/GM-CSF using two schedules of vaccination. Immune response was defined as a positive delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response and/or positive T-cell proliferation assay. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were enrolled between February 2013 and May 2016. Nineteen were treated with the high antigen burden, with four serious adverse reactions considered possibly related to TG01 treatment, including three allergic reactions. On this basis, a further 13 patients received a modified vaccination schedule with reduced antigen burden, with no serious adverse events related to TG01. Ninety-five percent patients in the main cohort and 92% in the modified cohort had a positive immune response. Median overall survival (OS) was 33.1 months, and median disease-free survival (DFS) was 13.9 months for the main cohort.

We aimed to compare CD10, which has limited value in this scenario, with interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1), a recently described sensitive and specific marker of endometrial stroma. Methods: We reviewed 25 hysterectomies containing endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma and adenomyosis. Tumor areas were classified as unequivocally myoinvasive or unequivocally noninvasive. Foci equivocal for invasion were also recorded. Immunohistochemistry for IFITM1 and CD10 was performed and scored in terms of intensity and distribution and classified as negative or positive. Results: Unlike CD10, IFITM1 staining showed significant differences in mean intensity (P \u003C .0001) and distribution (P \u003C .0001) between invasive vs noninvasive areas. Sixteen (84.2%) invasive and 34 (97.1%) noninvasive areas were positive for CD10 (P = .22). In contrast, none of the invasive vs 25 (71.4%) noninvasive areas were positive for IFITM1 (P \u003C .0001). IFITM1 had 71.4% sensitivity and 100% specificity in detecting stroma surrounding endometrioid adenocarcinoma, hence excluding myoinvasion. Eleven (45.8%) of 24 foci designated as equivocal stained with IFITM1. Conclusions: Compared with CD10, IFITM1 has superior performance distinguishing endometrial stroma of adenomyosis from mesenchyma surrounding invasive endometrial adenocarcinoma.

Three strains showed amino acid insertions: PEDv/MEX/GTO/LI\u2010DMZC15/2015 and PEDv/MEX/QRO/LI\u2010DMZC45/2016 showed one amino acid insertion ((424)Y(425) and (447)D(448), respectively), and PEDv/MEX/QRO/LI\u2010DMZC49/2019 showed one and two amino acid insertions ((422)C(423) and (537)SQ(538)), with the second insertion in the COE region. These results provide evidence of the prevalence of emerging, non\u2010Indel\u2010S strains of the virus are currently circulating in Mexico during 2016\u20132018, when three of which have amino acid insertions: PEDv/MEX/GTO/IN\u2010DMZC15/2015 and PEDv/MEX/QRO/IN\u2010DMZC45/2016 have one amino acid insertion each ((424)Y(425) and (447)D(448), respectively), and PEDv/MEX/QRO/IN\u2010DMZC49/2019 has one ((422)C(423)) and two amino acid insertions ((537)SQ(538)), the latter being in the COE region, which could generate new antigenic variants.","publish_time":"2019-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reveles\u2010F\u00E9lix, Sa\u00FAl; Carre\u00F3n\u2010N\u00E1poles, Rosalba; Mendoza\u2010Elvira, Susana; Quintero\u2010Ram\u00EDrez, V\u00EDctor; Garc\u00EDa\u2010S\u00E1nchez, Juvencio; Mart\u00EDnez\u2010Bautista, Rebeca; Saavedra\u2010Monta\u00F1ez, Manuel; Mosqueda Gualito, Juan Joel; S\u00E1nchez\u2010Betancourt, Jos\u00E9 Ivan","journal":"Transbound Emerg Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49a3d19ec21a9bd8258582d673b54001440259cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159366.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31733175/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COE"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["PEDv","amino acid insertions","QRO","states of Mexico","samples","S strains","S emerging variants","non\u2010Indel","prevalence of emerging","emerging disease","GTO","DMZC15","DMZC45","Mexican strains","PCR","spike gene","DMZC49","COE region","SQ","porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","pork industry","pork farms","real\u2010time RT","endpoint RT","new antigenic variants","substantial economic losses","week","old piglets","genetic characterization","sequencing","sequences","presence","piglet mortality rates","detection","evidence","phylogenetic analysis","Group","results","total"],"language":"en"},

Among ERVA strains infecting foals, the genotypes G3P[12] and G14P[12] are the most prevalent, while infections by strains with other genomic arrangements are infrequent. The identification of circulating strains of ERVA is critical for diagnostic and surveillance purposes, as well as to understand their molecular epidemiology. Current genotyping methods available for ERVA and rotaviruses affecting other animal species rely on Sanger sequencing and are significantly time-consuming, costly and labor intensive. Here, we developed the first one-step multiplex TaqMan(\u00AE) real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the NSP3 and VP7 genes of ERVA G3 and G14 genotypes for the rapid detection and G-typing directly from fecal specimens. METHODS: A one-step multiplex TaqMan(\u00AE) RT-qPCR assay targeting the NSP3 and VP7 genes of ERVA G3 and G14 genotypes was designed. The analytical sensitivity was assessed using serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA containing the target sequences while the analytical specificity was determined using RNA and DNA derived from a panel of group A rotaviruses along with other equine viruses and bacteria. The clinical performance of this multiplex assay was evaluated using a panel of 177 fecal samples and compared to a VP7-specific standard RT-PCR assay and Sanger sequencing. Limits of detection (LOD), sensitivity, specificity, and agreement were determined. RESULTS: The multiplex G3 and G14 VP7 assays demonstrated high specificity and efficiency, with perfect linearity. A 100-fold difference in their analytical sensitivity was observed when compared to the singleplex assays; however, this difference did not have an impact on the clinical performance. Clinical performance of the multiplex RT-qPCR assay demonstrated that this assay had a high sensitivity/specificity for every target (100% for NSP3, \u003E 90% for G3 VP7 and \u003E 99% for G14 VP7, respectively) and high overall agreement (\u003E 98%) compared to conventional RT-PCR and sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: This new multiplex RT-qPCR assay constitutes a useful, very reliable tool that could significantly aid in the rapid detection and G-typing of ERVA strains circulating in the field.","publish_time":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Carossino, Mariano; Barrandeguy, Maria E.; Erol, Erdal; Li, Yanqiu; Balasuriya, Udeni B.

METHODS: This was a single-center simulation study performed from December 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016. Each participant underwent quantitative fit test (QNFT) of N95 respirators according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration protocol. Adequacy of respirator fit was represented by the fit factor (FF), which is calculated as the number of ambient particles divided by the number inside the respirator. We divided all participants into the group that passed the overall fit test but failed at least one individual exercise (partially passed group [PPG]) and the group that passed all exercises (all passed group [APG]). Then, the participants performed three sessions of continuous chest compressions, each with a duration of 2 min, while undergoing real-time fit testing. The primary outcome was any failure (FF \u003C 100) of the fit test during the three bouts of chest compression. RESULTS: Forty-four participants passed the QNFT. Overall, 73% (n = 32) of the participants failed at least one of the three sessions of chest compression; the number of participants who failed was significantly higher in the PPG than in the APG (94% vs. 61%; p = 0.02). Approximately 18% (n = 8) of the participants experienced mask fit failures, such as strap slipping.

The lockdown of large parts of society and economic life has come as an exogenous shock to many economic actors, not least innovative startups. This rapid response research combines a qualitative research design informed by entrepreneurial ecosystem actors with an analysis of policy measures called for, announced, and reportedly implemented in the international press. Interviews from an entrepreneurial ecosystem offer a first-hand account of the adversity startups face during a crisis and how by utilizing bricolage responses they cope, and the analysis of policy measures can serve as an inspiration to design support initiatives to protect startups from the consequences of the current lockdown and to alleviate the effects of future crises. Managerial summary The lockdown measures as a response to the spread of the new coronavirus threaten the existence of many innovative startups. Our rapid response research first illustrates the challenges entrepreneurs face as a consequence of the crisis. Second, we illustrate how entrepreneurs are dealing with the effects of the crisis and what they are doing to protect their ventures. Finally, we present measures that could be utilized by policymakers to assist entrepreneurs facing challenges. The research conducted suggests that while startups are successfully leveraging their available resources as a first response to the crisis, their growth and innovation potential are at risk. Therefore, policy measures should not only provide first aid to startups by alleviating the pressure caused by constrained cashflow, but also involve long-term measures embedded in and supported by the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem to ensure rapid recovery and growth.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuckertz, Andreas; Br\u00E4ndle, Leif; Gaudig, Anja; Hinderer, Sebastian; Morales Reyes, Carlos Arturo; Prochotta, Alicia; Steinbrink, Kathrin; Berger, Elisabeth S.C.","journal":"Journal of Business Venturing Insights","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd9819a737ad66fe0dc403771c0e351f48ac28ca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352673420300251?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352673420300251; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbvi.2020.e00169","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lockdown measures","rapid response research","innovative startups","crisis","analysis of policy measures","long-term measures","drastic measures","present measures","adversity startups face","entrepreneurial ecosystem actors","qualitative research design","Abstract Research summary","wider entrepreneurial ecosystem","challenges entrepreneurs face","economic actors","rapid recovery","growth","current lockdown","economic life","new coronavirus","lockdown of large parts of society","Managerial summary","spread of COVID","effects of future crises","first-hand account","discovery","exogenous shock","pressure","innovation potential","consequences","inspiration","existence","constrained cashflow","support initiatives","risk","SARS-CoV","governments","available resources","aid","policymakers","bricolage responses","Interviews","international press","ventures"],"language":"en"},

Finally, X-ray photoelectron spectral (XPS) analyses revealed and quantified the elemental ratios in these composite formulations.","publish_time":"2017-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheong, Yuen-Ki; Calvo-Castro, Jesus; Ciric, Lena; Edirisinghe, Mohan; Cloutman-Green, Elaine; Illangakoon, Upulitha Eranka; Kang, Qiang; Mahalingam, Suntharavathanan; Matharu, Rupy Kaur; Wilson, Rory M.; Ren, Guogang","journal":"Nanomaterials (Basel)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab5bba6cb4c6f9a00931f232ac3be14667c4f807.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5535218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28644384/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nano7070152","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FTIR","NMR","WC/WC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AMNP1","AMNP2","AMNP0","C vibrational motions","multiple phases of WC","high state of purity","antimicrobial nanoparticle types","high concentration","solid state NMR spectra","FTIR spectra","observed sizes","X-ray powder diffraction","X-ray photoelectron spectral","strong Raman active vibrational bands","organic impurities","analyses","absence of polar bonds","single phase Tungsten carbide","ppm","morphology","hybridised carbons","Tesima","thermal plasma technology","elemental ratios","TM","particles","XPS","composite formulations","compositions","electron micrographs","Carbon signals","combination of analytical methods"],"language":"en"},

The separate reservoirs for a washing solution, an elution solution, and an RT-LAMP cocktail were designed with capillary valves for stable storage. Three influenza A virus strains (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and A/H5N1) were used for RNA templates, and RT-LAMP primer sets were designed to detect hemagglutinin (HA) and conserved M gene. Sequential sample flow to the microbeads for RNA purification was achieved by centrifugal force with optimization of capillary valves and a siphon channel. Furthermore, the purified RNA solution was successfully isolated from the waste solution by changing the rotational direction, and combined with the RT-LAMP cocktail in the RT-LAMP reaction chamber for target gene amplification. Total process from the sample injection to the result was completed in 47min. Influenza A H1N1 virus was confirmed on the integrated RT-LAMP microdevice even with 10 copies of viral RNAs, which revealed 10-fold higher sensitivity than that of a conventional RT-PCR. Subtyping and specificity test of influenza A H1N1 viral lysates were also performed and clinical samples were successfully genotyped to confirm influenza A virus on our proposed integrated microdevice.","publish_time":"2015-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jung, Jae Hwan; Park, Byung Hyun; Oh, Seung Jun; Choi, Goro; Seo, Tae Seok","journal":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1f2675c541a771450c1ec1195d8e7bd91977504.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111304.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S095656631400997X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25569879/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.12.043; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095656631400997X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsxOTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RT-LAMP cocktail","integrated RT-LAMP microdevice","RT-LAMP reaction chamber","RT-LAMP primer sets","purified RNA solution","viral RNA sample","conventional RT-PCR","RNA purification","elution solution","washing solution","waste solution","RNA templates","purified influenza","H1N1 viral lysates","proposed integrated microdevice","H1N1 virus","waste chamber","specificity test of influenza","sample injection","copies of viral RNAs","virus strains","integrated reverse transcriptase loop","optimization of capillary valves","target gene amplification","Sequential sample flow","isothermal amplification","separate reservoirs","real-time monitoring","centrifugal force","microbeads","RNase-free water","miniaturized optical detector","hemagglutinin","ethanol","chambers","siphon channel","rotational direction","Total process","stable storage","H5N1","clinical samples","higher sensitivity","H3N2","result"],"language":"en"},

The worldwide incidence of asthma has increased dramatically in the last 40 years. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, over 300 million children and adults worldwide currently suffer from this incurable disease and 255,000 die from the disease each year. It is now well accepted that asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome and many clinical subtypes have been described. Viral infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (hRV) have been implicated in asthma exacerbation in children because of their ability to cause severe airway inflammation and wheezing. Infections with atypical bacteria also appear to play a role in the induction and exacerbation of asthma in both children and adults. Recent studies confirm the existence of an infectious asthma etiology mediated by Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP) and possibly by other viral, bacterial and fungal microbes. It is also likely that early-life infections with microbes such as CP could lead to alterations in the lung microbiome that significantly affect asthma risk and treatment outcomes. These infectious microbes may exacerbate the symptoms of established chronic asthma and may even contribute to the initial development of the clinical onset of the disease. It is now becoming more widely accepted that patterns of airway inflammation differ based on the trigger responsible for asthma initiation and exacerbation. Therefore, a better understanding of asthma subtypes is now being explored more aggressively, not only to decipher pathophysiologic mechanisms but also to select treatment and guide prognoses. This review will explore infection-mediated asthma with special emphasis on the protean manifestations of CP lung infection, clinical characteristics of infection-mediated asthma, mechanisms involved and antibiotic treatment outcomes.","publish_time":"2017-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Webley, Wilmore C.; Hahn, David L.","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50d0f5fd4187d914ff40cacb3c436edc5b5bcc00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5437656.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-017-0584-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28526018/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma exacerbation","exacerbation of asthma","asthma risk","asthma initiation","infection-mediated asthma","infectious asthma etiology","worldwide incidence of asthma","symptoms of established chronic asthma","better understanding of asthma subtypes","children","chronic respiratory disease","airway hyperresponsiveness","clinical subtypes","Viral infections","infectious microbes","incurable disease","clinical characteristics of infection","severe airway inflammation","patterns of airway inflammation","reversible airway obstruction","protean manifestations of CP lung infection","clinical onset","antibiotic treatment outcomes","fungal microbes","adults","early-life infections","lung microbiome","pathophysiologic mechanisms","respiratory syncytial virus","non-specific bronchoconstriction agonists","special emphasis","RSV","ability","trigger responsible","existence","Chlamydia pneumoniae","heterogeneous syndrome","primary underlying pathophysiology","human rhinovirus","estimates","hRV","World Health Organization","role","initial development","alterations","wheezing","induction","review","Recent studies","atypical bacteria","guide prognoses","years"],"language":"en"},

Meta-analysis offers the opportunity to confirm and expand our knowledge by combining and studying at one time a vast set of independent studies creating large datasets with increased statistical power. In this study, we performed two meta-analyses of porcine transcriptomic data: i) scrutinized the global immune response to different challenges, and ii) determined the specific response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) infection. To gain an in-depth knowledge of the pig response to PRRSV infection, we used an original approach comparing and eliminating the common genes from both meta-analyses in order to identify genes and pathways specifically involved in the PRRSV immune response. The software Pointillist was used to cope with the highly disparate data, circumventing the biases generated by the specific responses linked to single studies. Next, we used the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software to survey the canonical pathways, biological functions and transcription factors found to be significantly involved in the pig immune response. We used 779 chips corresponding to 29 datasets for the pig global immune response and 279 chips obtained from 6 datasets for the pig response to PRRSV infection, respectively. RESULTS: The pig global immune response analysis showed interconnected canonical pathways involved in the regulation of translation and mitochondrial energy metabolism. Biological functions revealed in this meta-analysis were centred around translation regulation, which included protein synthesis, RNA-post transcriptional gene expression and cellular growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondria dysfunctions, associated with stress signalling, were highly regulated. Transcription factors such as MYCN, MYC and NFE2L2 were found in this analysis to be potentially involved in the regulation of the immune response. The host specific response to PRRSV infection engendered the activation of well-defined canonical pathways in response to pathogen challenge such as TREM1, toll-like receptor and hyper-cytokinemia/ hyper-chemokinemia signalling. Furthermore, this analysis brought forth the central role of the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune response and the regulation of anti-inflammatory response. The most significant transcription factor potentially involved in this analysis was HMGB1, which is required for the innate recognition of viral nucleic acids. Other transcription factors like interferon regulatory factors IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and IRF8 were also involved in the pig specific response to PRRSV infection. CONCLUSIONS: This work reveals key genes, canonical pathways and biological functions involved in the pig global immune response to diverse challenges, including PRRSV infection. The powerful statistical approach led us to consolidate previous findings as well as to gain new insights into the pig immune response either to common stimuli or specifically to PRRSV infection.","publish_time":"2013-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Badaoui, Bouabid; Tuggle, Christopher K; Hu, Zhiliang; Reecy, James M; Ait-Ali, Tahar; Anselmo, Anna; Botti, Sara","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd18b402ae6cf0913a3a12aef3a8819964d8057e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3623894.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23552196/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Porcine Reproductive","PRRSV","Ingenuity Pathways Analysis","MYCN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pig response","PRRSV immune response","pig immune response challenges","pig specific response","adaptive immune response","pig global immune response analysis","host specific response","PRRSV infection","regulation of anti-inflammatory response","Meta-analysis","host immune system","Ingenuity Pathways Analysis","transcription factors","interconnected canonical pathways","activation of well-defined canonical pathways","regulation of translation","translation regulation","biological functions","common genes","specific responses","meta-analyses of porcine transcriptomic data","large datasets","diverse challenges","key genes","availability of gene expression data","different challenges","disparate data","significant transcription factor","chips","interferon regulatory factors IRF1","transcriptional gene expression","hyper-chemokinemia signalling","powerful statistical approach","hyper-cytokinemia","common stimuli","single studies","stress signalling","original approach","software Pointillist","in-depth knowledge","increased statistical power","vast set of independent studies","innate recognition of viral nucleic acids","Respiratory Syndrome Virus","pathogen challenge","compelling material","toll","receptor","IRF3","understanding","crosstalk","protein synthesis","mitochondria dysfunctions","IRF5","cellular growth","RNA","TREM1","work","IPA","order","new insights","time","proliferation","IRF8","mitochondrial energy metabolism","biases","central role","MYCN","RESULTS","oxidative phosphorylation","previous findings","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","NFE2L2","opportunity","study","HMGB1"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies have determined that CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes are required to restrict acute, productive MCMV infection within the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we investigated the contribution of humoral immune responses in control of MCMV brain infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Utilizing our MCMV brain infection model, we investigated B-lymphocyte-lineage cells and assessed their role in controlling the recovery of reactivated virus from latently infected brain tissue. Brain infiltrating leukocytes were first phenotyped using markers indicative of B-lymphocytes and plasma cells. Results obtained during these studies showed a steady increase in the recruitment of B-lymphocyte-lineage cells into the brain throughout the time-course of viral infection. Further, MCMV-specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) were detected within the infiltrating leukocyte population using an ELISPOT assay. Immunohistochemical studies of brain sections revealed co-localization of CD138(\u002B) cells with either IgG or IgM. Additional immunohistochemical staining for MCMV early antigen 1 (E1, m112\u2013113), a reported marker of viral latency in neurons, confirmed its expression in the brain during latent infection. Finally, using B-cell deficient (Jh(\u2212/\u2212)) mice we demonstrated that B-lymphocytes control recovery of reactivated virus from latently-infected brain tissue. A significantly higher rate of reactivated virus was recovered from the brains of Jh(\u2212/\u2212) mice when compared to Wt animals. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate that MCMV infection triggers accumulation and persistence of B-lymphocyte-lineage cells within the brain, which produce antibodies and play a significant role in controlling reactivated virus.","publish_time":"2012-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mutnal, Manohar B.; Hu, Shuxian; Lokensgard, James R.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df23488abbb0cbdb69b7afe7f1da1d7b38df19e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3295797.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22412996/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control of MCMV brain infection","MCMV brain infection model","mouse brain","productive MCMV infection","acute infection","viral infection","infected brain tissue","Experimental infection","latent infection","MCMV infection triggers accumulation","lymphocyte-lineage cells","Immunohistochemical studies of brain sections","plasma cells","MCMV-specific antibody secreting cells","MCMV early antigen","B-lymphocytes control recovery of reactivated virus","persistence of B","recruitment of B","higher rate of reactivated virus","B-cell deficient","Previous studies","mice","Results","neuroimmune responses","significant role","brains of Jh","Additional immunohistochemical staining","markers indicative of B-lymphocytes","infiltrating leukocyte population","contribution of humoral immune responses","reported marker of viral latency","murine CMV","central nervous system","co-localization of CD138","neurons","ASC","expression","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","time-course","m112","ELISPOT assay","CD8","E1","steady increase","extensive bystander damage","CNS","T lymphocytes","BACKGROUND","leukocytes","antibodies","METHODOLOGY","Wt animals","IgM","study","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an Arterivirus that has been devastating the swine industry worldwide. Interstitial pneumonia is considered to be one of the most obvious clinical signs of PRRSV infection, suggesting that the inflammatory response plays an important role in PRRSV pathogenesis. However, whether DHX36 is involved in PRRSV-induced inflammatory cytokine expression remains unclear. In this study, we found that PRRSV infection increased the expression of DHX36. Knockdown of DHX36 and its adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) by small-interfering RNA in MARC-145 cells significantly reduced NF-\u03BAB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression after PRRSV infection. Further investigation revealed that PRRSV nucleocapsid protein interacted with the N-terminal quadruplex binding domain of DHX36, which in turn augmented nucleocapsid protein-induced NF-\u03BAB activation.

In the work reported here, neck domains of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR expressed in isolation are shown to form tetramers in the absence of the CRDs. Stability analysis indicates that interactions between the neck domains account fully for the stability of the tetrameric extracellular portions of the receptors. The neck domains are approximately 40% \u03B1-helical based on circular dichroism analysis. However, in contrast to other glycan-binding receptors in which fully helical neck regions are intimately associated with C-terminal C-type CRDs, the neck domains in DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR act as autonomous tetramerization domains and the neck domains and CRDs are organized independently.

Pharmacologic research with marine chemicals continue to contribute potentially novel chemical leads in the ongoing global search for therapeutic agents in the treatment of multiple diverse categories. As infectious diseases evolve and develop resistance to existing pharmaceuticals, the marine environment provides novel leads against fungal, parasitic, bacterial and viral diseases. Limitations in our current antiviral treatment options and the continuing emergence of new pathogenic viruses have contributed to a growing need for new and effective chemotherapeutic agents to treat viral diseases. The search for potent antiviral agents is urgent in view of the dramatic situation of the global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, a possible spread of avian influenza and of other viral diseases. Effective antiviral therapeutics are not available, and the presently approved therapy for HIV has been recognized to be toxic, unable to eradicate the causative virus, and to induce severe drug resistance. The marine environment provides a rich source of chemical diversity for the screening and identification of new compounds with desirable antiviral properties. Antiviral testing has revealed numerous compounds from structural classes including polysaccharides, terpenoids, steroids, alkaloids and peptides that potentially inhibit both RNA and DNA viruses. This review presents an account of some research directed toward the discovery of new antiviral agents from marine sources.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martinez, Maria Jose Abad; Del Olmo, Luis Miguel Bedoya; Benito, Paulina Bermejo","journal":"Studies in Natural Products Chemistry","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1572599508800051; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572599508800051","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["discovery of new antiviral agents","potent antiviral agents","marine environment","Antiviral testing","viral diseases","marine chemicals","marine bacteria","marine sources","Effective antiviral therapeutics","desirable antiviral properties","current antiviral treatment options","infectious diseases","identification of new compounds","effective chemotherapeutic agents","novel chemical leads","novel leads","HIV","continuing emergence of new pathogenic viruses","ongoing global search","global human immunodeficiency virus","numerous compounds","treatment of multiple diverse categories","causative virus","DNA viruses","Pharmacologic research","severe drug resistance","rich source of chemical diversity","diverse array of natural products","polysaccharides","epidemic","dramatic situation","terpenoids","structural classes","molluscs","screening","growing need","possible spread of avian influenza","steroids","bryozoans","existing pharmaceuticals","invertebrates","peptides","sponges","tunicates","alkaloids","unique resources","Limitations","RNA","approved therapy","cyanobacteria","oceans","review","account"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 132 immunosuppressed children who underwent FB and BAL because pulmonary complications between January 1999 and May 2014 at the Hacettepe University Hospital Pediatric Pulmonology Unit. Two groups, Group I (n = 106) and Group II (n = 26), consisted of patients who had primary or secondary immunodeficiency and those who were immunosuppressed because BMT, respectively. Radiological findings before FB and macroscopic and microscopic findings of the procedure were evaluated. RESULTS: FB and BAL were diagnostic in 86/132 patients (65.1%) and the antimicrobial treatment changed for 75/132 patients (56.8%). The most common pathogen was bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading one). Bacteria were more frequent in Group I than Group II (P = .008). No significant difference in radiological findings between Groups I and II was found.

A primary diagnosis of a gastroenteritis-related disorder was noted in 9.8% of children aged below 5 years, and a primary or secondary diagnosis in 11.8%. Any CMS diagnosis of rotavirus (ICD 008.61) was initially used to derive incidence estimates of rotavirus by age group. Rotavirus was recorded as any primary or any secondary diagnosis in 1.6% of children below 5 years of age. The unadjusted incidence rates per 100,000 person-years based on any CMS diagnosis of rotavirus were: 249 (0 to \u003C1m); 612 (1 to \u003C2m); 1066 (2 to \u003C6m); 1383 (6 to \u003C11m); 959 (1 to \u003C2y); 406 (2 to \u003C3y); 233 (3 to \u003C4y); 124 (4 to \u003C5y). Overall the rotavirus incidence was 1071 in children below 2 years and 542 in children below 5 years of age, with the incidence rates trending up during the time period (p = 0.001). A similar but less marked upward trend (p = 0.046) was noted for the incidence of all-cause gastroenteritis. Laboratory results from a single surveillance hospital (1 July 2000 to 31 March 2011) were then linked to these CMS codes to derive adjustment factors for possible over- and under-diagnosis of rotavirus based on CMS codes alone. This analysis suggested that a CMS diagnosis of rotavirus alone likely under-reported true incidence by a factor of between 1.59 and 2.02 in children below 5 years of age. Despite the availability of rotavirus vaccines in the private sector since 2006, no reduction in the incidence of hospitalisation for either rotavirus or all-cause gastroenteritis was noted in Hong Kong children below 5 years of age over 14 rotavirus seasons (1997\u20132011).","publish_time":"2014-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chiang, Grace P.K.; Nelson, E.

We further show that purified human effector memory CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes transmigrate more readily across blood-brain barrier-endothelial cells than non-effector memory CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes, and that blood-brain barrier endothelium promotes the selective recruitment of effector memory CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the recruitment of interferon-\u03B3- and interleukin-17-secreting CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes by human and mouse blood-brain barrier endothelium. Finally, we show that in vitro migration of CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes across blood-brain barrier-endothelial cells is dependent on \u03B14 integrin, but independent of intercellular adhesion molecule-1/leucocyte function-associated antigen-1, activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule/CD6 and the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1/CCL2. We also demonstrate that in vivo neutralization of very late antigen-4 restricts central nervous system infiltration of CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes in active immunization and adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and in coronavirus-induced encephalitis. Our study thus demonstrates an active role of the blood-brain barrier in the recruitment of effector memory CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes to the CNS compartment and defines \u03B14 integrin as a major contributor of CD8(\u002B) T lymphocyte entry into the brain.","publish_time":"2011-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ifergan, Igal; Kebir, Hania; Alvarez, Jorge I.; Marceau, Gabriel; Bernard, Monique; Bourbonni\u00E8re, Lyne; Poirier, Jos\u00E9e; Duquette, Pierre; Talbot, Pierre J.; Arbour, Nathalie; Prat, Alexandre","journal":"Brain","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52960cbce549d2e88be69df08c2b945cb7154adf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110084.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awr268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22058139/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T lymphocytes","secreting CD8","expanded CD8","migration of CD8","human effector memory CD8","non-effector memory CD8","selective recruitment of effector memory CD8","blood-brain barrier-endothelial cells","major contributor of CD8","T lymphocyte entry","mouse blood-brain barrier endothelium","central nervous system infiltration of CD8","effector memory phenotype","exact phenotype of central nervous system-infiltrating CD8","multiple sclerosis lesions","adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","\u03B14 integrin","spinal cord","recruitment of interferon","coronavirus-induced encephalitis","cerebrospinal fluid of patients","leucocyte cell adhesion molecule","active immunization","independent of intercellular adhesion molecule","leucocyte function-associated antigen","active role","late antigen","brainstem lesions","chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein","CNS compartment","interleukin","CD62L","CCL2","CCR7","mechanism","neutralization","study","evidence","granzymeB"],"language":"en"},

On the one hand, the UPS can be used by the cell to degrade viral proteins, thereby restricting the viral infection. On the other hand, it can also be subverted by the virus to its own advantage, notably to induce degradation of cellular restriction factors. This makes the UPS a central player in viral restriction and counter-restriction. In this respect, the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and 2) represent excellent examples. Indeed, many steps of the HIV life cycle are restricted by cellular proteins, some of which are themselves components of the UPS. However, HIV itself hijacks the UPS to mediate defense against several cellular restriction factors. For example, the HIV auxiliary proteins Vif, Vpx and Vpu counteract specific restriction factors by the recruitment of cellular UPS components.

This was a multicenter and retrospective cohort study performed at five nationwide cancer centers. The number of cancer patients in each center was allocated by the proportion of cancer surgery. Adult patients were randomly selected according to the allocated number, among those who underwent cancer surgery from January to December 2014 within 6 months after diagnosis of cancer. One\u2010year cumulative incidence of POP was estimated using Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis. An univariable Cox\u0027s proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for POP development. As a multivariable analysis, confounders were adjusted using multiple Cox\u0027s PH regression model. Among the total 2000 patients, the numbers of patients with gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and HCC were 497 (25%), 525 (26%), 277 (14%), 552 (28%), and 149 (7%), respectively. Overall, the 1\u2010year cumulative incidence of POP was 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4\u20132.6). The 1\u2010year cumulative incidences in each cancer were as follows: lung 8.0%, gastric 1.8%, colorectal 1.0%, HCC 0.7%, and breast 0.4%. In multivariable analysis, older age, higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score, ulcer disease, history of pneumonia, and smoking were related with POP development.

Therefore, development of antiviral strategies is an important task. The activation of the viral spike protein (S) by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity and the responsible enzymes are potential therapeutic targets. The cellular proteases furin, cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 can activate MERS-S and may cleave the S protein at two distinct sites, termed S1/S2 and S2\u2032. Moreover, a potential cathepsin L cleavage site in MERS-S has been reported. However, the relative importance of these sites for MERS-S activation is incompletely understood. Here, we used mutagenic analysis and MERS-S-bearing vectors to study the contribution of specific cleavage sites to S protein-driven entry. We found that an intact S1/S2 site was only required for efficient entry into cells expressing endogenous TMPRSS2. In keeping with a previous study, pre-cleavage at the S1/S2 motif (RSVR) was important although not essential for subsequent MERS-S activation by TMPRSS2, and indirect evidence was obtained that this motif is processed by a protease depending on an intact RXXR motif, most likely furin. In contrast, the S2\u2032 site (RSAR) was required for robust viral entry into all cell lines tested and the integrity of one of the two arginines was sufficient for efficient entry. These findings suggest that cleavage at S2\u2032 is carried out by proteases recognizing a single arginine, most likely TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Finally, mutation of the proposed cathepsin L site did not impact viral entry and double mutation of S1/S2 and S2\u2032 site was compatible with cathepsin L- but not TMPRSS2-dependent host cell entry, indicating that cathepsin L can process the S protein at auxiliary sites. Collectively, our results indicate a rigid sequence requirement for S protein activation by TMPRSS2 but not cathepsin L.","publish_time":"2018-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kleine-Weber, Hannah; Elzayat, Mahmoud Tarek; Hoffmann, Markus; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1185137c3c9ddbc0c91aa718179dadd11039f771.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6226446.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34859-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30413791/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["S2 site","S protein activation","S protein-driven entry","S2 motif","subsequent MERS-S activation","potential cathepsin","likely TMPRSS2","efficient entry","proposed cathepsin","robust viral entry","TMPRSS2-dependent host cell entry","MERS-CoV","endogenous TMPRSS2","viral spike protein","intact S1","host cell proteases","viral infectivity","distinct sites","termed S1","contribution of specific cleavage sites","pre-cleavage","auxiliary sites","double mutation of S1","cell lines","intact RXXR motif","likely furin","cellular proteases furin","pandemic potential","potential therapeutic targets","important task","previous study","responsible enzymes","rigid sequence requirement","Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus","RSVR","severe disease","single arginine","indirect evidence","arginines","vectors","cells","RSAR","development of antiviral strategies","results","integrity","relative importance","mutagenic analysis","findings","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Here, we localize the site of frameshifting and show that the frameshifting reaction is mediated by slippage of two adjacent tRNAs by a single nucleotide in the 5\u2032 direction. The gag terminator, which immediately follows the frameshift site, is not required for frameshifting. Other suspected retroviral frameshift sites mediate frameshifting when placed at the end of RSV gag. Mutations in RSV pol also affect synthesis of the gag-pol protein in vitro. The effects of these mutations best correlate with the potential to form an RNA stem-loop structure adjacent to the frameshift site. A short sequence of RSV RNA, 147 nucleotides in length, containing the frameshift site and stem-loop structure, is sufficient to direct frameshifting in a novel genetic context.","publish_time":"1988-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacks, Tyler; Madhani, Hiten D.; Masiarz, Frank R.; Varmus, Harold E.","journal":"Cell","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/618af94e679636181030cd0fa230d5e0224ff0b9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092867488900311; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0092867488900311","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1Mjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","RSV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["site of frameshifting","direct frameshifting","ribosomal frameshifting","RSV pol","frameshifting reaction","end of RSV gag","gag terminator","RNA stem-loop structure adjacent","gag-pol protein of Rous sarcoma virus","short sequence of RSV RNA","suspected retroviral frameshift sites","adjacent tRNAs","mutations best correlate","different translational reading frames","synthesis","integration","enzymes responsible","precursor","potential","nucleotides","length","reverse transcription","novel genetic context","genes","single nucleotide","slippage","effects","direction"],"language":"en"},

It is necessary to understand public knowledge and behaviors if we are to effectively address the pandemic. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that knowledge of COVID-19 influences participation in different behaviors including self-reports of purchasing more goods than usual, attending large gatherings, and using medical masks. METHODS Funded and IRB approved on March 17, 2020, Cross-sectional online survey of 1,034 U.S. residents age 18\u002B conducted on March 17, 2020. RESULTS For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (OR=0.88, 95% CI:0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR=0.87, 95%CI: 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR=0.56, 95% CI:0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively. Gen X and Millennial participants had 56% to 76% higher odds, respectively, of increased purchasing behavior, compared to Baby Boomers. Results suggest politicization of response recommendations. Democrats had 30% lower odds of attending large gatherings (OR=0.70, 95% CI:0.50-0.97), and 48% lower odds of using medical masks (OR=0.52, 95% CI:0.34-0.78), compared to Republicans. CONCLUSIONS This survey is one of the first attempts to study determinants of knowledge and behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. A national, coordinated effort at pandemic response may ensure better compliance with behavioral recommendations to address this public health emergency.

In a controlled setting using small numbers of volunteers removed from community exposure to other infections, this experimental model enables proof of concept work to be undertaken on novel therapeutics, including vaccines, immunomodulators and antivirals, as well as new diagnostics. Crucially, unlike conventional phase 1 studies, challenge studies include evaluable efficacy endpoints that then guide decisions on how to optimise subsequent field studies, as recommended by the FDA and thus licensing studies that follow. Such a strategy optimises the benefit of the studies and identifies possible threats early on, minimising the risk to subsequent volunteers but also maximising the benefit of scarce resources available to the research group investing in the research. Inspired by the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) now commonly applied in the preclinical phase, HVC studies allow refinement and reduction of the subsequent development phase, accelerating progress towards further statistically powered phase 2b studies. The breadth of data generated from challenge studies allows for exploration of a wide range of variables and endpoints that can then be taken through to pivotal phase 3 studies. We describe the disease burden for acute respiratory viral infections for which current conventional development strategies have failed to produce therapeutics that meet clinical need. The Authors describe the HVC model\u2019s utility in increasing scientific understanding and in progressing promising therapeutics through development. The contribution of the model to the elucidation of the virus-host interaction, both regarding viral pathogenicity and the body\u2019s immunological response is discussed, along with its utility to assist in the development of novel diagnostics.

Here, we developed a rapid and simultaneous detection toolkit for influenza A H5 subtype viruses in human samples based on a bioconjugate of quantum dots (QDs) assembly and a smartphone-based rapid dual fluorescent diagnostic system (SRDFDS). Methods: Two types of QDs were assembled on a latex bead to enhance the detection sensitivity and specificity of influenza A infection (QD580) and H5 subtype (QD650). The dual signals of influenza A and H5 subtype of H5N1-infected patients were detected simultaneously and quantified separately by SRDFDS equipped with two emission filters. Results: Our results showed a high sensitivity of 92.86% (13/14) and 78.57% (11/14), and a specificity of 100% (38/38, P \u003C 0.0001) and 97.37% (37/38) for influenza A and H5 subtype detection, respectively.

Insulin undergoes conformational changes under certain stress conditions leading to amyloid fibrils. Fibrillation of insulin poses a problem in its long-term storage, reducing its efficacy in treating type II diabetes. The dissociation of insulin oligomer to monomer is the key step for the onset of fibrillation. The time course of insulin fibrillation at 62\u00B0C using Thioflavin T fluorescence shows an increase in the lag time from 120 min without peptide to 236 min with peptide. Transmission electron micrographs show branched insulin fibrils in its absence and less inter-fibril association in its presence. Upon incubation at 62\u00B0C and pH 2.6, insulin lost some \u03B1-helical structure as seen by Fourier transformed infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), but if the peptide is added, secondary structure is almost fully maintained for 3 h, though lost partially at 4 h. FT-IR spectroscopy also shows that insulin forms the cross beta structure indicative of fibrils beyond 2 h, but in the presence of the peptide, \u03B1-helix retention is seen till 4 h. Both size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering show that insulin primarily exists as trimer, whose conversion to a monomer is resisted by the peptide. Saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance confirms that the hydrophobic residues in the peptide are in close contact with an insulin hydrophobic groove. Molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with principal component analyses reveal how the peptide interrupts insulin fibrillation. In vitro hemolytic activity of the peptide showed insignificant cytotoxicity against HT1080 cells.

A wide range of viral, bacterial and fungal agents can cause pneumonia: although viruses are the most common etiologic agent, the severity of clinical symptoms associated with bacterial pneumonia and increasing antibiotic resistance makes bacterial pneumonia a major public health concern. Bacterial pneumonia can follow upper respiratory viral infection and complicate lower respiratory viral infection. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a major cause of influenza-related deaths. In this review, we evaluate the following hypotheses: (i) respiratory viruses influence the etiology of pneumonia by altering bacterial community structure in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and (ii) respiratory viruses promote or inhibit colonization of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) by certain bacterial species residing in the URT. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine temporal associations between respiratory viruses and bacteria and a targeted review to identify potential mechanisms of interactions. We conclude that viruses both alter the bacterial community in the URT and promote bacterial colonization of the LRT. However, it is uncertain whether changes in the URT bacterial community play a substantial role in pneumonia etiology. The exception is Streptococcus pneumoniae where a strong link between viral co-infection, increased carriage and pneumococcal pneumonia has been established.","publish_time":"2016-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Kyu Han; Gordon, Aubree; Foxman, Betsy","journal":"Evol Med Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db7ddc7b6e1689aed55b17716e2c2d3309b56f90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4801059.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/emph/eow007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26884414/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["URT","LRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Secondary bacterial pneumonia","bacterial colonization","respiratory viruses","URT bacterial community","etiology of pneumonia","pneumonia etiology","pneumococcal pneumonia","bacterial community structure","upper respiratory viral infection","certain bacterial species","upper respiratory tract","lower respiratory tract","complicate lower respiratory viral infection","viral co-infection","wide range of viral","major cause of influenza","targeted review","LRT","systematic review","leading cause of death","major public health concern","strong link","increased carriage","antibiotic resistance","substantial role","severity of clinical symptoms","temporal associations","children","common etiologic agent","literature","fungal agents","Streptococcus pneumoniae","related deaths","changes","potential mechanisms of interactions","following hypotheses","exception","years old"],"language":"en"},

Recent finds include human bocaviruses, which now seem to have a global distribution, and cause respiratory tract disease in infants, and several new pathogenic human coronaviruses. The SARS coronavirus, genetically distinct from all previously known coronaviruses, caused a disease which was highly transmissible and very severe, eventually leading to 8000 cases worldwide with over 800 deaths. Many viruses which are transmitted to humans by invertebrates, such as insects or ticks, have the ability to infect and replicate in cells of both vertebrate and invertebrate origin. However human virology is a rapidly expanding field and recent technologies such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification system have made it possible to look for previously unrecognized viruses which may or may not be involved in pathogenesis. For example viruses in the genus Anellovirus are found in 80% of human blood samples yet do not seem to cause any disease. This paper overviews known human vertebrate viruses, more recent discoveries, and recommends a systematic search for viruses which may already infect the human population but have so far remained undetected.","publish_time":"2011-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mahy, Brian W.J.","journal":"Biodiversity (Nepean)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ae3e91806dd61fd3c36d0256ab5de18c13a298d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32309018/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14888386.2006.9712792","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs2MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human viruses","human vertebrate viruses","human virology","human bocaviruses","human population","example viruses","unrecognized viruses","human blood samples","new pathogenic human coronaviruses","recent technologies","recent discoveries","Recent finds","known coronaviruses","respiratory tract disease","polymerase chain reaction","infants","amplification system","PCR","expanding field","insects","animals","plants","cells","paper overviews","global distribution","systematic search","ticks","invertebrates","bacteria","fungi","ability","invertebrate origin","humans","genus Anellovirus","diseases","cases","SARS coronavirus","deaths","pathogenesis"],"language":"en"},

In addition, there are marked species and age differences in protein expression, homology and drug binding affinity. As such, a thorough understanding of drug binding to AAG can help aid and improve the translation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships from preclinical species to human as well as adults to neonates.

The objectives of this study were to identify the mechanisms used by MHV type 3 to modulate the production of IFN-\u03B3 by NK cells during the acute hepatitis in susceptible C57BL/6 mice. Ex vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that NK cells, expressing carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAM) 1a (the MHV receptor), can produce a higher level of IFN-\u03B3 in the presence of both L2-MHV3 and interleukin-12 (IL-12)/IL-18. The synergistic production of IFN-\u03B3 by NK cells depends on viral replication rather than viral fixation only, because it is inhibited or not induced in cells infected with ultraviolet-inactivated viruses and in cells from Ceacam1a(\u2212/\u2212) mice infected with virulent viruses. The synergistic IFN-\u03B3 production involves the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) rather than the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 MAPK signalling pathway. However, the signal triggered through the engagement of CEACAM1a decreases the production of IFN-\u03B3, when these molecules are cross-linked using specific monoclonal antibodies. These results suggest that control of acute hepatitis by IFN-\u03B3-producing NK cells may depend on both production of IL-12 and IL-18 in the liver environment and viral infection of NK cells.","publish_time":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jacques, Alexandre; Bleau, Christian; Turbide, Claire; Beauchemin, Nicole; Lamontagne, Lucie","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/236b1805940d77a4d22e39432cd0ef46d277dc0b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2753941.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.03030.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740316/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHV","NK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["synergistic IFN-\u03B3 production","synergistic production of IFN","production of IL","viral infection of NK cells","production of interferon","higher level of IFN","control of acute hepatitis","viral replication","viral fixation","MHV type","MHV receptor","mice","control of mouse hepatitis virus","liver environment","extracellular signal-regulated kinase","engagement of CEACAM1a","virulent viruses","MAPK signalling pathway","ultraviolet-inactivated viruses","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules","natural killer","susceptible C57BL","L2-MHV3","presence","specific monoclonal antibodies","mechanisms","interleukin","results","experiments","study","objectives"],"language":"en"},

In this study we addressed whether inactivated HHV-6B can also induce IFN lambda responses and to what extent interferons alpha and lambda affect Th1/Th2 polarization. We show that inactivated HHV-6B induced IFN-lambda1 (IL-29) but not IFN-lambda2 (IL-28A) responses in plasmacytoid DC and that this induction was mediated through TLR9. We have previously shown that HHV-6B promotes Th1 responses and blocks Th2 responses in both humans and mice. We now show that neutralization of IFN-alpha but not IFN-lambda1 blocked the HHV-6B-induced enhancement of Th1 responses in MLR, but did not affect the HHV-6-induced dampening of Th2 responses. Similarly, blockage of TLR9 counteracted HHV-6Bs effects on the Th1/Th2 balance. In addition, IFN-alpha but not IFN-lambda1 promoted IFN-gamma production and blocked IL-5 and IL-13 production in purified CD4\u002B T-cells. The lack of effect of IFN-lambda1 correlated with the absence of the IFN-lambda receptor IL-28Ralfa chain on the cell surface of both resting and activated CD4\u002B T-cells. We conclude that inactivated HHV-6B is a strong inducer of IFN-lambda1 in plasmacytoid DC and that this induction is TLR9-dependent. However, human CD4\u002B T-cells do not express the IFN-lambda receptor and are refractory to IFN-lambda1 treatment.

In a short period of time, important aspects of SARS-CoV S-protein function were unraveled. The identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for SARS-CoV provided an insight into viral tropism and pathogenesis, whereas mapping of functional domains in the S-protein enabled inhibitors to be generated. Vaccines designed on the basis of SARS-CoV S-protein were shown to be effective in animals and consequently are attractive candidates for vaccine trials in humans.

G6PD-deficient cells experience a high level of oxidative stress and an increased susceptibility to viral infections. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key mediator in the regulation of viral replication and inflammatory response. In the current study, the role of G6PD on the inflammatory response was determined in both scramble control and G6PD-knockdown (G6PD-kd) A549 cells upon tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) stimulation. A decreased expression pattern of induced COX-2 and reduced production of downstream PGE(2) occurred upon TNF-\u03B1 stimulation in G6PD-kd A549 cells compared with scramble control A549 cells. TNF-\u03B1-induced antiviral activity revealed that decreased COX-2 expression enhanced the susceptibility to coronavirus 229E infection in G6PD-kd A549 cells and was a result of the decreased phosphorylation levels of MAPK (p38 and ERK1/2) and NF-\u03BAB. The impaired inflammatory response in G6PD-kd A549 cells was found to be mediated through NADPH oxidase (NOX) signaling as elucidated by cell pretreatment with a NOX2-siRNA or NOX inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI). In addition, NOX activity with TNF-\u03B1 treatment in G6PD-kd A549 cells was not up-regulated and was coupled with a decrease in NOX subunit expression at the transcriptional level, implying that TNF-\u03B1-mediated NOX signaling requires the participation of G6PD. Together, these data suggest that G6PD deficiency affects the cellular inflammatory response and the decreased TNF-\u03B1-mediated antiviral response in G6PD-kd A549 cells is a result of dysregulated NOX/MAPK/NF-\u03BAB/COX-2 signaling.","publish_time":"2016-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Hsin-Ru; Wu, Yi-Hsuan; Yen, Wei-Chen; Yang, Chuen-Mao; Chiu, Daniel Tsun-Yee","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/78057e9db3bebe6ecfc99fbc036414ebd4115cfd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4838297.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27097228/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs3Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NADPH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["G6PD-kd A549 cells","G6PD-deficient cells","G6PD-knockdown","role of G6PD","G6PD deficiency","participation of G6PD","decreased TNF-\u03B1","TNF-\u03B1 stimulation","scramble control A549 cells","TNF-\u03B1 treatment","mediated NOX","NOX activity","decreased COX","cellular inflammatory response","antiviral response","NOX inhibitor","impaired inflammatory response","NOX subunit expression","result of dysregulated NOX","decreased expression pattern of induced COX","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","antiviral activity","decreased phosphorylation levels of MAPK","NF-\u03BAB","cellular needs","transcriptional level","increased susceptibility","viral infections","NADPH oxidase","regulation of viral replication","reducing agent NADPH","high level of oxidative stress","E infection","NOX2-siRNA","reductive biosynthesis","p38","coronavirus","reduced production of downstream PGE","maintenance of redox homeostasis","key mediator","ERK1","diphenyleneiodonium chloride","cell pretreatment","phosphate dehydrogenase","current study","addition","Glucose","data","Cyclooxygenase"],"language":"en"},

Generally, there was an overall positive attitude from participants toward hand hygiene practice. In total, 87.54% acknowledged that they routinely used alcohol-based hand rub, 87.4% had sufficiently decontaminated hands even under high work pressure, and 78.6% addressed that this practice was not affected by less compliant colleagues.

Mimicking an infection-driven model of sHLH in mice, we observed that the tissue-derived levels of IFN\u03B3 are actually 500- to 2000-fold higher than those measured in the blood. To identify a blood biomarker, we postulated that the IFN\u03B3 gene products, CXCL9 and CXCL10 would correlate with disease parameters in the mouse model. To translate this into a disease relevant biomarker, we investigated whether CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels correlated with disease activity in pediatric sHLH patients. Our data demonstrate that disease control in mice correlates with neutralization of IFN\u03B3 activity in tissues and that the 2 chemokines serve as serum biomarkers to reflect disease status. Importantly, CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels in pediatric sHLH were shown to correlate with key disease parameters and severity in these patients. Thus, the translatability of the IFN\u03B3-biomarker correlates from mouse to human, advocating the use of serum CXCL9 or CXCL10 as a means to monitor total IFN\u03B3 activity in patients with sHLH.","publish_time":"2016-08-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buatois, Vanessa; Chatel, Laurence; Cons, Laura; Lory, Sabrina; Richard, Fran\u00E7oise; Guilhot, Florence; Johnson, Zo\u00EB; Bracaglia, Claudia; De Benedetti, Fabrizio; de Min, Cristina; Kosco-Vilbois, Marie H.; Ferlin, Walter G.","journal":"Transl Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d116a7b859591e2ca1977e1a1336676ccc9de7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185816.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2016.07.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931524416301578; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931524416301578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27559680/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs4ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HLH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease activity","CXCL10 levels","IFN\u03B3-biomarker correlates","disease control","disease status","neutralization of IFN\u03B3 activity","total IFN\u03B3 activity","disease relevant biomarker","tissue-derived levels of IFN\u03B3","key disease parameters","pediatric sHLH patients","IFN\u03B3 gene products","blood biomarker","use of serum CXCL9","mice correlates","infection-driven model of sHLH","mouse model","serum biomarkers","maintenance of HLH","Life-threatening cytokine release syndromes","interferon \u03B3","means","healthy individuals","human","forms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","afflictions","detection","central role","development","measurable concentrations","tissues","severity","chemokines","data","translatability"],"language":"en"},

However, further analyses, using other TGEV\u2010 and PEDV\u2010specific RT\u2010qPCR assays, provided results inconsistent with infection by either of these viruses. Sequencing of an amplicon (ca. 1.6 kb), generated by an RT\u2010PCR specific for the PEDV S\u2010gene, indicated a very close similarity (ca. 99% identity) to recently described chimeric viruses termed swine enteric coronaviruses (SeCoVs). These viruses (with an RNA genome of ca. 28 kb) were first identified in Italy in samples from 2009 but have not been detected there since 2012. A closely related virus was detected in archived samples in Germany from 2012, but has not been detected subsequently. Building on the initial sequence data, further amplicons were generated and over 9 kb of sequence corresponding to the 3\u2032\u2010terminus of the new SeCoV genome was determined. Sequence comparisons showed that the three known SeCoVs are \u226598% identical across this region and contain the S\u2010gene and 3a sequences from PEDV within a backbone of TGEV, but the viruses are clearly distinct from each other. It is demonstrated, for the first time, that pigs from within the SeCoV\u2010infected herd seroconverted against PEDV but tested negative in a TGEV\u2010specific ELISA that detects antibodies against the S protein. These results indicate that SeCoV is continuing to circulate in Europe and suggest it can cause a disease that is very similar to PED. Specific detection of the chimeric SeCoVs either requires development of a new diagnostic RT\u2010qPCR assay or the combined use of assays targeting the PEDV S\u2010gene and another part of the TGEV genome.","publish_time":"2016-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belsham, G.

But no studies to date have systematically described liver test abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with abnormal liver test results. METHODS: Clinical records and laboratory results were obtained from 417 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the only referral hospital in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to February 21, 2020 and followed up to March 7, 2020. Information on clinical features of patients with abnormal liver tests were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Of 417 patients with COVID-19, 318 (76.3%) had abnormal liver test results and 90 (21.5%) had liver injury during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, with 49 (23.4%), 31 (14.8%), 24 (11.5%) and 51 (24.4%) patients having alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels elevated to more than 3\u00D7 the upper limit of normal, respectively. Patients with abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type or mixed type at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe disease (odds ratios [ORs] 2.73; 95% CI 1.19\u20136.3, and 4.44, 95% CI 1.93\u201310.23, respectively). The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was also found to lead to increased odds of liver injury (OR from 4.44 to 5.03, both p \u003C0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with abnormal liver tests were at higher risk of progressing to severe disease. The detrimental effects on liver injury mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which should be monitored and evaluated frequently. LAY SUMMARY: Data on liver tests in patients with COVID-19 are scarce. We observed a high prevalence of liver test abnormalities and liver injury in 417 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our referral center, and the prevalence increased substantially during hospitalization. The presence of abnormal liver tests and liver injury were associated with the progression to severe pneumonia. The detrimental effects on liver injury were related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which warrants frequent monitoring and evaluation for these patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Qingxian; Huang, Deliang; Yu, Hong; Zhu, Zhibin; Xia, Zhang; Su, Yinan; Li, Zhiwei; Zhou, Guangde; Gou, Jizhou; Qu, Jiuxin; Sun, Yan; Liu, Yingxia; He, Qing; Chen, Jun; Liu, Lei; Xu, Lin","journal":"J Hepatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5cfb31a4260bcc4507831e154f7d585ca9cb0000.json; document_parses/pdf_json/13d72f82a139dfbdf64553e31df087199ee35284.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194951.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298767/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2020.04.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BACKGROUND","CI"],"locations":["Shenzhen","China"],"keyphrases":["presence of abnormal liver tests","abnormal liver test results","increased odds of liver injury","abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type","high prevalence of liver test abnormalities","clinical features of patients","hospitalization","severe disease","clinical characteristics of COVID","coronavirus disease","laboratory results","severe pneumonia","higher odds of progressing","odds ratios","certain medications","Clinical records","detrimental effects","CI","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","higher risk of progressing","mixed type","aspartate aminotransferase","alanine aminotransferase","Recent data","referral hospital","referral center","total bilirubin","admission","gamma-glutamyl transferase levels","ORs","SARS-CoV","AIMS","METHODS","outbreak","frequent monitoring","date","LAY SUMMARY","progression","CONCLUSION","Shenzhen","China","BACKGROUND","evaluation","Information","impact","analysis","upper limit of normal","use of lopinavir","ritonavir","light","weeks","studies"],"language":"en"},

The majority of zoonotic pathogens infect and are amplified by multiple vertebrate species in nature, each of which has a quantitatively different impact on the distribution and abundance of the pathogen and thus on disease risk. Unfortunately, when new zoonotic pathogens emerge, the dominant response by public health scientists is to search for a few, or even the single, most important reservoirs and to ignore other species that might strongly influence transmission. This focus on the single \u201Cprimary\u201D reservoir host species can delay biological understanding, and potentially public health interventions as species important in either amplifying or regulating the pathogen are overlooked. Investigating the evolutionary and ecological strategy of newly discovered or emerging pathogens within the community of potential and actual host species will be fruitful to both biological understanding and public health.","publish_time":"2011-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brisson, Dustin; Brinkley, Catherine; Humphrey, Parris T.; Kemps, Brian D.; Ostfeld, Richard S.","journal":"Interdiscip Perspect Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af06f5132b3178795ba440ec4f4949e9008c1737.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3228346.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/741406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22162687/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species important","reservoir host species","actual host species","nonhuman reservoir species","strict host-species specialists","multiple vertebrate species","new zoonotic pathogens","majority of zoonotic pathogens","emerging pathogens","public health interventions","public health scientists","biological understanding","important reservoirs","community of potential","dominant response","humans","ecological strategy","distribution","abundance","different impact","nature","definition","disease risk","focus","transmission"],"language":"en"},

Methods Case-study methodology was used to examine and contextualise the analysis of the Republic of Kiribati\u0027s adoption of the IPCP from 2003 to 2010. Data were collected from multiple sources including semi-structured interviews, IPCP documentation, program evaluation and a healthcare worker survey. Data were subjected to thematic analysis and descriptive statistics where relevant to the study design. Results It was found that the self-initiated progression of activities and stimuli has resulted in the successful adoption of a comprehensive IPCP. The process followed the staged model of the classic Diffusion of Innovations process in organisations described by Everett Rogers. Conclusion This case study provides an illustration of how a comprehensive IPCP can be adopted in a LMI country setting with little involvement from external agencies. It identifies key stimuli, opportunities and activities which could be similarly adopted and implemented by other LMI countries.","publish_time":"2015-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zimmerman, Peta-Anne; Yeatman, Heather; Jones, Michael; Murdoch, Helen","journal":"Healthcare infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b73a5babce7bef66f42f28a16056b8b210e5a9ba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288840/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1835561716300175; https://doi.org/10.1071/hi14036; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1835561716300175","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY4LmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1695057,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Fq5\u002BN9p5VGRn7QmIJsUbqg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_68.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Everett Rogers"],"organizations":["LMI"],"locations":["Republic of Kiribati","Republic"],"keyphrases":["comprehensive IPCP","IPCP documentation","case study","LMI country","study design","Methods Case-study methodology","LMI countries","Data","classic Diffusion of Innovations process","Diffusion of Innovations framework","Republic of Kiribati\u0027s adoption","program evaluation","control program","thematic analysis","key stimuli","successful adoption","self-initiated progression of activities","semi-structured interviews","organisations","infection prevention","multiple sources","descriptive statistics","little involvement","illustration","staged model","middle income","healthcare worker survey","role","external agencies","Everett Rogers","Abstract Introduction","aim","opportunities","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an increase in severe EV-D68 respiratory infections was observed in our region. STUDY DESIGN: Samples from patients with respiratory symptoms were screened for viral pathogens, including rhinovirus and enterovirus. Subsequently, samples positive for rhinovirus and enterovirus were routinely sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, an additional method was used to detect EV-D68 specifically. RESULTS: During the first three quarters of the year 2014, 1896 respiratory samples were analyzed; 39 (2%) of them tested positive for enterovirus. Eighteen samples tested positive for EV-D68, obtained from 16 different patients admitted to our hospital. Eleven were children below the age of 18, of whom five children needed intensive care treatment. The remaining five samples were from adults, who all had an underlying disease; three were transplant patients (heart, lung and renal transplantation), the other two had an underlying lung condition (COPD, asthma). Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship with the strains circulating currently in the USA, all belonging to the known EV-D68 genetic subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an increase of EV-D68 infections in our population, both in children as well as in adult. In 2014 there have been 16 cases so far, compared to none in 2011 and 2013 and a single case in 2012. Phylogenetic analysis identified two similar clusters as shown in the USA and Canada.","publish_time":"2014-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Poelman, Randy; Sch\u00F6lvinck, Elisabeth H.; Borger, Renze; Niesters, Hubert G.M.; van Leer-Buter, Coretta","journal":"J Clin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74b797a519c9490a738d39684b15ec4fedfe25d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185662.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653214004193; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2014.11.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542461/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653214004193","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enterovirus D68","D68 infections","increase of EV","respiratory samples","severe EV-D68 respiratory infections","samples positive","children","known EV-D68 genetic subtypes","phylogenetic analysis","USA","severe respiratory symptoms","different patients","rhinovirus","Canada","underlying lung condition","underlying disease","viral pathogens","COPD","asthma","heart","close relationship","quarters","similar clusters","population","renal transplantation","STUDY DESIGN","strains","intensive care treatment","adults","year","hospital","additional method","region","single case","RESULTS","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","age","BACKGROUND","cases"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We searched 7 data sources for eligible traditional medicine guidelines up to March 6, 2020 and found a total of 28 traditional medicine guidelines that provide treatment measures for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 28 guidelines, there were 26 government-issued Chinese guidelines and 2 Korean guidelines. After standardizing the terminology of the PIs and herbal formulae, there were 8 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 11 PIs and 31 herbal formulae for the moderate stage, 8 PIs and 21 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 6 PIs and 23 herbal formulae for the recovery stage in the Chinese guidelines. In the Korean guidelines, there were 4 PIs and 15 herbal formulae for the mild stage, 3 PIs and 3 herbal formulae for the severe stage, and 2 PIs and 2 herbal formulae for the recovery stage. In the frequency analysis of herbs, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma was found to be the herb with the highest frequency of usage in the Chinese guidelines.

The utility of CMV-DNA viral load measurement has not been standardized, and viral cut-off values have not been established.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the microbiologic and pathologic results of bronchial washing fluid and biopsy specimens in addition to the patients\u0027 clinical characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 565 CMV qRT-PCR assays were performed using bronchial washing fluid from patients with hematologic malignancies. Among them, 101 were positive for CMV by qRT-PCR; of these, 24 were diagnosed with CMV pneumonia and 70 with CMV infection, and 7 were excluded due to a diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis rather than viral pneumonia. The median CMV load determined by qPCR was 1.8 \u00D7 10(5) copies/mL (3.6 10(3)-1.5 \u00D7 10(8)) in CMV pneumonia patients and 3.0 \u00D7 10(3) copies/mL (5.0 \u00D7 10(2)-1.1 \u00D7 10(5)) in those diagnosed with CMV infection (P \u003C 0.01).

Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) produced during viral infections may be one of the stimuli for exacerbation. We aimed to assess the potential effect of dsRNA on certain aspects of chronic asthma through the administration of polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), synthetic dsRNA, to a rat model of asthma. Brown Norway rats were sensitized to ovalbumin and challenged three times to evoke airway remodelling. The effect of poly I:C on the ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation and structural changes was assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and histological findings. The expression of cytokines and chemokines was evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and ELISA. Ovalbumin-challenged animals showed an increased number of total cells and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with PBS-challenged controls. Ovalbumin-challenged animals treated with poly I:C showed an increased number of total cells and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with those without poly I:C treatment. Ovalbumin-challenged animals showed goblet cell hyperplasia, increased airway smooth muscle mass, and proliferation of both airway epithelial cells and airway smooth muscle cells. Treatment with poly I:C enhanced these structural changes. Among the cytokines and chemokines examined, the expression of interleukins 12 and 17 and of transforming growth factor-\u03B2(1) in ovalbumin-challenged animals treated with poly I:C was significantly increased compared with those of the other groups. Double-stranded RNA enhanced airway inflammation and remodelling in a rat model of bronchial asthma. These observations suggest that viral infections may promote airway remodelling.","publish_time":"2011-09-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takayama, Satoshi; Tamaoka, Meiyo; Takayama, Koji; Okayasu, Kaori; Tsuchiya, Kimitake; Miyazaki, Yasunari; Sumi, Yuki; Martin, James G; Inase, Naohiko","journal":"Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/695d579adc250bf8a32e633b6c472c5a786e6730.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3194222.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21896009/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2011.03473.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Brown Norway"],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["airway remodelling","airway epithelial cells","ovalbumin-induced airway inflammation","animals","effect of poly","C treatment","airway smooth muscle cells","increased airway smooth muscle mass","increased number of total cells","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","Double-stranded RNA enhanced airway inflammation","rat model of asthma","exacerbations of asthma","Respiratory viral infections","rat model of bronchial asthma","synthetic dsRNA","structural changes","potential effect of dsRNA","chemokines","expression of cytokines","certain aspects of chronic asthma","expression of interleukins","goblet cell hyperplasia","proliferation","eosinophils","neutrophils","administration of polyinosine","real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR","ELISA","polycytidylic acid","PBS","histological findings","transforming growth factor-\u03B2","Brown Norway rats","times","stimuli","controls","observations","groups"],"language":"en"},

The World Health Organization (WHO) has been coordinating the international response to provide the epidemiological, laboratory, clinical and logistic requirements needed to contain this disease. A rapid spread of SARS around the world occurred at its onset, facilitated greatly by air travel. Between November 2002 and July 2003, a total of 8,094 cases and 774 cases were reported from 26 countries worldwide. WHO responded quickly to this multi-country outbreak and on 12 March released a \u201Cglobal alert\u201D about SARS. This was followed by the first WHO travel advisory on 15 March. The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network was activated, and international experts were brought together to implement enhanced global surveillance systems for SARS. The international community has learned a lot of lessons from the SARS outbreak. Particularly, rapid and transparent information sharing between countries is critical to prevent international spread of the disease.

The recombinant virus, which expresses spike with the three substitutions, was nonfusogenic at neutral pH. Its replication was significantly inhibited by lysosomotropic agents, and it was highly neuroattenuated in vivo. In contrast, the recombinant expressing spike with L1114R alone mediated cell-to-cell fusion at neutral pH and replicated efficiently despite the presence of lysosomotropic agents; however, it still caused only subclinical morbidity and no mortality in animals. Thus, both recombinant viruses were highly attenuated and expressed viral antigen which was restricted to the olfactory bulbs and was markedly absent from other regions of the brains at 5 days postinfection. These data demonstrate that amino acid substitutions, in particular L1114R, within HR1 of the JHM spike reduced the ability of MHV to spread in the central nervous system. Furthermore, the requirements for low pH for fusion and viral entry are not prerequisites for the highly attenuated phenotype.","publish_time":"2003-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsai, Jean C; Groot, Linda de; Pinon, Josefina D; Iacono, Kathryn T; Phillips, Joanna J; Seo, Su-hun; Lavi, Ehud; Weiss, Susan R","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1fe3f895e38e337398e1ab4c612339d3b8e72c90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125853.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203002484; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203002484","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsxOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["particular L1114R","neutral pH","recombinant viruses","MHV-JHM spike gene","cell fusion","low pH","HR1","amino acid substitutions","presence of lysosomotropic agents","mediated cell","ability of MHV","viral entry","viral antigen","attenuated phenotype","mouse hepatitis viruses","MHVs","prerequisites","heptad","Q1094H","defined genetic background","brains","Q1067H","subclinical morbidity","mortality","animals","regions","data","requirements","nonfusogenic","central nervous system","days postinfection","olfactory bulbs","Abstract Targeted recombination","replication","contrast"],"language":"en"},

We demonstrated that CypA played an essential role in EV71 entry and that the RNA interference-mediated reduction of endogenous CypA expression led to decreased EV71 multiplication. We further revealed that CypA directly interacted with and modified the conformation of H-I loop of the VP1 protein in EV71 capsid, and thus regulated the uncoating process of EV71 entry step in a pH-dependent manner.

Fifteen distinct chimeric viruses were constructed to evaluate both structural and non-structural regions of the genome and infection patterns were determined through artificial infectious feeds in An. gambiae with each of these chimeras. Only one region, non-structural protein 3 (nsP3), was sufficient to up-regulate infection to rates similar to those seen with parental ONNV.

Thus, we have shown that a non-structural genome element involved in viral replication is a major element involved in ONNV\u0027s unique vector specificity.","publish_time":"2013-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saxton-Shaw, Kali D.; Ledermann, Jeremy P.; Borland, Erin M.; Stovall, Janae L.; Mossel, Eric C.; Singh, Amber J.; Wilusz, Jeffrey; Powers, Ann M.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39a7144ced64a39e54d38f82f589db2ad9513b40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3554527.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23359824/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0001931","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjsyNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ONNV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection rates","ONNV non-structural protein","different infection patterns","nsP3","non-structural genome element","CHIKV virus","non-structural regions","parental ONNV","specific molecular determinants of infection","Chikungunya virus","Anopheles gambiae","ONNV\u0027s unique vector specificity","viral region addition","O\u0027nyong nyong virus","distinct chimeric viruses","viral replication","major element","anopheline mosquitoes","related alphaviruses","artificial infectious feeds","single gene","chimeras"],"language":"en"},

However, a considerable group of patients does not respond to statin treatment, and the reason for this is still not completely understood. [(18)F]Atorvastatin, the (18)F-labeled version of one of the most widely prescribed statins, may be a useful tool for statin-related research. RESULTS: [(18)F]Atorvastatin was synthesized via an optimized ruthenium-mediated late-stage (18)F-deoxyfluorination. The defluoro-hydroxy precursor was produced via Paal-Knorr pyrrole synthesis and was followed by coordination of the phenol to a ruthenium complex, affording the labeling precursor in approximately 10% overall yield. Optimization and automation of the labeling procedure reliably yielded an injectable solution of [(18)F]atorvastatin in 19% \u00B1 6% (d.c.) with a molar activity of 65 \u00B1 32 GBq\u00B7\u03BCmol(\u22121). Incubation of [(18)F]atorvastatin in human serum did not lead to decomposition. Furthermore, we have shown the ability of [(18)F]atorvastatin to cross the hepatic cell membrane to the cytosolic and microsomal fractions where HMG-CoA reductase is known to be highly expressed. Blocking assays using rat liver sections confirmed the specific binding to HMG-CoA reductase. Autoradiography on rat aorta stimulated to develop atherosclerotic plaques revealed that [(18)F]atorvastatin significantly accumulates in this tissue when compared to the healthy model. CONCLUSIONS: The improved ruthenium-mediated (18)F-deoxyfluorination procedure overcomes previous hurdles such as the addition of salt additives, the drying steps, or the use of different solvent mixtures at different phases of the process, which increases its practical use, and may allow faster translation to clinical settings. Based on tissue uptake evaluations, [(18)F]atorvastatin showed the potential to be used as a tool for the understanding of the mechanism of action of statins. Further knowledge of the in vivo biodistribution of [(18)F]atorvastatin may help to better understand the origin of off-target effects and potentially allow to distinguish between statin-resistant and non-resistant patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clemente, Gon\u00E7alo S.; Rickmeier, Jens; Antunes, In\u00EAs F.; Zarganes-Tzitzikas, Tryfon; D\u00F6mling, Alexander; Ritter, Tobias; Elsinga, Philip H.","journal":"EJNMMI Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f9455f777cbde12a005cc6bb93fd201642f16d8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/323bdc850ffe94d9e737215e435a44e268f57ef2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158976.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296962/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13550-020-00622-4","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Paal-Knorr"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Atorvastatin","F-deoxyfluorination procedure","labeling precursor","labeling procedure","HMG-CoA reductase","ruthenium complex","optimized ruthenium","statin treatment","statin-resistant","improved ruthenium","prescribed statins","statin-related research","different phases","use of different solvent mixtures","useful tool","rat aorta","practical use","non-resistant patients","cholesterol synthesis","rat liver sections","defluoro-hydroxy precursor","considerable group of patients","tissue uptake evaluations","Paal-Knorr pyrrole synthesis","specific binding","microsomal fractions","previous hurdles","hepatic cell membrane","drying steps","process","addition of salt additives","faster translation","secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases","lipid","agents","coordination","human serum","stage","mechanism of action","injectable solution","GBq","clinical settings","atherosclerotic plaques","understanding","assays","phenol","Optimization","automation","potential","overall yield","origin","target effects","molar activity","decomposition","healthy model","Autoradiography","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","reason","biodistribution","knowledge","\u03BCmol","version","RESULTS","Incubation","ability"],"language":"en"},

CoV spike (S) protein which is crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion via conformational changes, internalization of the virus, host tissue tropism and comprises crucial targets for vaccine development, remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, the present study has been planned to determine the sequence variation, structural and antigenic divergence of S glycoprotein which may be helpful for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The sequences of spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were used for the comparison. The sequence variations were determined using EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence alignment tools. The variation in glycosylation sites was predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0 and validated by N-GlyDE server. Antigenicity was predicted by NetCTL 1.2 and validated by IEDB Analysis Resource server. The structural divergence was determined by using SuperPose Version 1.0 based on cryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Our data suggests that 2019-nCoV is newly spilled coronavirus into humans in China is closely related to SARS-CoV, which has only 12.8% of difference with SARS-CoV in S protein and has 83.9% similarity in minimal receptor-binding domain with SARS-CoV. Addition of a novel glycosylation sites were observed in 2019-nCoV. In addition, antigenic analysis proposes that great antigenic differences exist between both the viral strains, but some of the epitopes were found to be similar between both the S proteins. In spite of the variation in S protein amino acid composition, we found no significant difference in their structures. Collectively, for the first time our results exhibit the emergence of human 2019-nCoV is closely related to predecessor SARS-CoV and provide the evidence that 2019-nCoV uses various novel glycosylation sites as SARS-CoV and may have a potential to become pandemic owing its antigenic discrepancy.

This review will describe the historical, current, and future developments of such technologies.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mori, Yasuyoshi; Notomi, Tsugunori","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02367294fca9464069595ab8c888b068764131e5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/da660ef71f3b2ec65b89971ab6b915abc1c15c6a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10156-009-0669-9; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X09707007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19396514/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X09707007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LAMP methodology","combination of LAMP","developing countries","isothermal amplification","current focus","future developments","near future","fatal tropical diseases","novel microfluidic technologies","cost-effective diagnosis of infectious diseases","established nucleic acid amplification method","variety of pathogens","resource-limited laboratories","realization of genetic point","available detection kits","diagnostic system","care testing systems","Abstract Loop","chip","bacteria","viruses","review","technology"],"language":"en"},

The present study was conducted to assess the burden of premature mortality due to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we have utilized publicly available data from the WHO website related to 1789 MERS patients reported between September 23, 2012 and May 17, 2019. To calculate the standard expected years of life lost (SEYLL), life expectancy at birth was set according to the 2000 global burden of disease study on levels 25 and 26 of West model life tables from Coale-Demeny at 82.5 and 80 years for females and males, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, the total SEYLL in males and females was 10,702 and 3817.5 years, respectively. The MERS patients within the age range of 30\u201359 year-olds had the highest SEYLL (8305.5 years) in comparison to the patients within the age groups 0\u201329 (SEYLL = 3744.5 years) and \u2265 60 years (SEYLL = 2466.5 years). The total SEYLL in all age groups in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 were 71.5, 2006.5, 3162, 4425.5, 1809.5, 878, 1257.5 and 909 years, respectively. The most SEYLL related to MERS-CoV infection was in the early four years of the onset of the pandemic (2012 to 2015) and in the last four years of the MERS-CoV pandemic (216 to 2019), a significant reduction was observed in the SEYLL related to MERS-CoV infection in the MERS patients. CONCLUSION: We believe that the findings of this study will shed light about the burden of premature mortality due to MERS infection in the world and the results may provide necessary information for policy-makers to prevent, control, and make a quick response to the outbreak of MERS-CoV disease.","publish_time":"2019-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Salamatbakhsh, Maryam; Mobaraki, Kazhal; Sadeghimohammadi, Sara; Ahmadzadeh, Jamal","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74c245d5a0275629dce204354579d47071dffb85.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6857218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31727042/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7899-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS patients","MERS infection","MERS-CoV infection","MERS-CoV pandemic","outbreak of MERS","total SEYLL","highest SEYLL","CoV disease","standard expected years of life","global burden of disease study","overall burden","burden of premature mortality","age groups","international study","present study","life expectancy","age range","RESULTS","emerging infectious disease","females","case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","West model life tables","levels","Coale-Demeny","light","policy-makers","necessary information","control","quick response","year-olds","website","world","comparison","findings","onset","Saudi Arabia","birth","retrospective analysis","available data","METHODS","significant reduction","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","countries"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the study was to analyze viral coinfection and its relationship to clinical severity. METHODS: Hospitalized pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of respiratory infection were studied during the period between 2009-2010. Clinical and epidemiological data, duration of hospitalization, need for oxygen therapy, bacterial coinfection and need for mechanical ventilation were collected. Etiology was studied by multiplex PCR and low-density microarrays for 19 viruses. RESULTS: A total of 385 patients were positive, 44.94% under 12 months. The most frequently detected viruses were RSV-B: 139, rhinovirus: 114, RSV-A: 111, influenza A H1N1-2009: 93 and bocavirus: 77. Coinfection was detected in 61.81%, 36.36% with 2 viruses, 16.10% and 9.35% with 3 to 4 or more. Coinfection was higher in 2009 with 69.79 vs. 53.88% in 2010. Rhinovirus/RSV-B on 10 times and RSV-A/RSV-B on 5 times were the most detected coinfections. Hospitalization decreased with greater number of viruses (P \u003C 0,001). Oxygen therapy was required by 26.75% (one virus was detected in 55.34% of cases). A larger number of viruses resulted in less need for oxygen (P \u003C 0,001). Ten cases required mechanical ventilation, 4 patients with bacterial coinfection and 5 with viral coinfection (P = 0,69). CONCLUSIONS: An inverse relationship was found between the number of viruses detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate, the need for oxygen therapy and hospitalization days. More epidemiological studies and improved quantitative detection techniques are needed to define the role of viral coinfections in respiratory disease and its correlation with the clinical severity.","publish_time":"2014-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mart\u00EDnez-Roig, A.; Salvad\u00F3, M.; Caballero-Rabasco, M.A.; S\u00E1nchez-Buenavida, A.; L\u00F3pez-Segura, N.; Bonet-Alcaina, M.","journal":"Arch Bronconeumol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127166.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666712/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2014.01.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV-A/RSV-B"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detected viruses","bacterial coinfection","RSV-B","need","oxygen therapy","detected coinfections","greater number of viruses","larger number of viruses","clinical severity","clinical diagnosis of respiratory infection","respiratory disease","pediatric patients","duration of hospitalization","role of viral coinfections","hospitalization days","times","mechanical ventilation","rhinovirus","cases","etiology of respiratory tract infections","introduction of molecular techniques","epidemiological studies","epidemiological data","inverse relationship","improved quantitative detection techniques","better understanding","nasopharyngeal aspirate","correlation","multiplex PCR","low-density microarrays","children","total","study","H1N1","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHODS","period","influenza","bocavirus","months","objective"],"language":"en"},

A requirement for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis was implied by our previous demonstration that cerulenin, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, impaired vaccinia virus production. Here we show that additional inhibitors of this pathway, TOFA and C75, reduce viral yield significantly, with partial rescue provided by exogenous palmitate, the pathway\u0027s end-product. Palmitate\u0027s major role during infection is not for phospholipid synthesis or protein palmitoylation. Instead, the mitochondrial import and \u03B2-oxidation of palmitate are essential, as shown by the impact of etomoxir and trimetazidine, which target these two processes respectively. Moreover, the impact of these inhibitors is exacerbated in the absence of exogenous glucose, which is otherwise dispensable for infection. In contrast to glucose, glutamine is essential for productive viral infection, providing intermediates that sustain the TCA cycle (anaplerosis). Cumulatively, these data suggest that productive infection requires the mitochondrial \u03B2-oxidation of palmitate which drives the TCA cycle and energy production. Additionally, infection causes a significant rise in the cellular oxygen consumption rate (ATP synthesis) that is ablated by etomoxir. The biochemical progression of the vaccinia life cycle is not impaired in the presence of TOFA, C75, or etomoxir, although the levels of viral DNA and proteins synthesized are somewhat diminished. However, by reversibly arresting infections at the onset of morphogenesis, and then monitoring virus production after release of the block, we determined that virion assembly is highly sensitive to TOFA and C75. Electron microscopic analysis of cells released into C75 revealed fragmented aggregates of viroplasm which failed to be enclosed by developing virion membranes. Taken together, these data indicate that vaccinia infection, and in particular virion assembly, relies on the synthesis and mitochondrial import of fatty acids, where their \u03B2-oxidation drives robust ATP production.","publish_time":"2014-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greseth, Matthew D.; Traktman, Paula","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dacb58b5ac7adedfeb44dde5632c503c5d37548f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3961357.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24651651/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004021","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TCA","TOFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccinia infection","productive infection","C75","productive viral infection","mitochondrial \u03B2-oxidation","vaccinia life cycle","TCA cycle","impaired vaccinia virus production","ATP synthesis","exogenous palmitate","energy production","impact of etomoxir","robust ATP production","poxvirus life cycle","mitochondrial import of fatty acids","phospholipid synthesis","viral yield","presence of TOFA","particular virion assembly","virion membranes","data","fatty acid synthase inhibitor","novo fatty acid biosynthesis","levels of viral DNA","absence of exogenous glucose","cellular functions","additional inhibitors","cellular oxygen consumption rate","cerulenin","glutamine","significant rise","previous demonstration","partial rescue","block","intermediates","Electron microscopic analysis of cells","onset of morphogenesis","proteins","requirement","biochemical progression","fragmented aggregates of viroplasm","pathway\u0027s end-product","host nucleus","Palmitate\u0027s major role","arresting infections","protein palmitoylation","contrast","trimetazidine","release","anaplerosis","processes"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, Jena-like polymerase sequences were identified for the first time in the UK, but one of these, Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK, was a chimeric virus. Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK had a Jena-like polymerase gene but Newbury2-like capsid and ORF3 genes by comparison of their genome organization, nucleotide, and amino acid identities and phylogenetic analyses. The present study is one of few studies to clearly demonstrate the existence of chimeric genomes in the Norovirus genus and the first, to our knowledge, to identify a chimeric genome in genogroup III.

Arteriviruses (order Nidovirales) belong to the subset of \u002BRNA viruses that induce double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), similar to the structures induced by e.g. coronaviruses, picornaviruses and hepatitis C virus. In the last years, electron tomography has revealed substantial differences between the structures induced by these different virus groups. Arterivirus-induced DMVs appear to be closed compartments that are continuous with endoplasmic reticulum membranes, thus forming an extensive reticulovesicular network (RVN) of intriguing complexity. This RVN is remarkably similar to that described for the distantly related coronaviruses (also order Nidovirales) and sets them apart from other DMV-inducing viruses analysed to date. We review here the current knowledge and open questions on arterivirus replication organelles and discuss them in the light of the latest studies on other DMV-inducing viruses, particularly coronaviruses. Using the equine arteritis virus (EAV) model system and electron tomography, we present new data regarding the biogenesis of arterivirus-induced DMVs and uncover numerous putative intermediates in DMV formation. We generated cell lines that can be induced to express specific EAV replicase proteins and showed that DMVs induced by the transmembrane proteins nsp2 and nsp3 form an RVN and are comparable in topology and architecture to those formed during viral infection. Co-expression of the third EAV transmembrane protein (nsp5), expressed as part of a self-cleaving polypeptide that mimics viral polyprotein processing in infected cells, led to the formation of DMVs whose size was more homogenous and closer to what is observed upon EAV infection, suggesting a regulatory role for nsp5 in modulating membrane curvature and DMV formation.","publish_time":"2016-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"van der Hoeven, Barbara; Oudshoorn, Diede; Koster, Abraham J.; Snijder, Eric J.; Kikkert, Marjolein; B\u00E1rcena, Montserrat","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9749435126275cc8b4c6d69d8eba0cbc796406b4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111217.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27071852/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.04.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021630199X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021630199X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DMV","EAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Arterivirus-induced DMVs","RNA viruses","formation of DMVs","DMV formation","EAV infection","RVN","viral RNA synthesis","viral infection","arterivirus replication organelles","EAV transmembrane protein","electron tomography","biogenesis of arterivirus","viruses appropriate host cell membranes","specific EAV replicase proteins","nsp5","structures","related coronaviruses","order Nidovirales","eukaryotic positive-stranded RNA","viral polyprotein processing","transmembrane proteins nsp2","equine arteritis virus","hepatitis C virus","different virus groups","cell lines","modulating membrane curvature","double-membrane vesicles","endoplasmic reticulum membranes","regulatory role","model system","numerous putative intermediates","open questions","extensive reticulovesicular network","infected cells","nsp3","new data","picornaviruses","compartments","self-cleaving polypeptide","current knowledge","substantial differences","specialized micro-environments","architecture","size","subset","intriguing complexity","latest studies","Co-expression","light","topology","years","Arteriviruses","date"],"language":"en"},

We performed a genome-wide comparison between the adaptive evolution of R5 and X4 variants from HIV-1 subtypes B and C. The results showed that R5 and X4 variants experienced differential evolutionary patterns and different HIV-1 genes encountered various positive selection pressures, suggesting that complex selection pressures are driving HIV-1 evolution. Compared with other hypervariable regions of Gp120, significantly more positively selected sites were detected in the V3 region of subtype B X4 variants, V2 region of subtype B R5 variants, and V1 and V4 regions of subtype C X4 variants, indicating an association of positive selection with co-receptor recognition/binding. Intriguingly, a significantly higher proportion (33.3% and 55.6%, P\u003C0.05) of positively selected sites were identified in the C3 region than other conserved regions of Gp120 in all the analyzed HIV-1 variants, indicating that the C3 region might be more important to HIV-1 adaptation than previously thought. Approximately half of the positively selected sites identified in the env gene were identical between R5 and X4 variants. There were three common positively selected sites (96, 113 and 281) identified in Gp41 of all X4 and R5 variants from subtypes B and C. These sites might not only suggest a functional importance in viral survival and adaptation, but also imply a potential cross-immunogenicity between HIV-1 R5 and X4 variants, which has important implications for AIDS vaccine development.","publish_time":"2010-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, ChiYu; Ding, Na; Chen, KePing; Yang, RongGe","journal":"Sci China Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24a98f5c08b96b0a50ca97edc2626155041bf15b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20953943/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11427-010-4066-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["C.

Highly infectious and profoundly virulent diseases may be caused in combat personnel or in civilian populations by the appropriate dissemination of viruses, bacteria, spores, fungi, or toxins. Dissemination may be airborne, waterborne, or by contamination of food or surfaces. Countermeasures may be directed toward destroying or neutralizing the agents outside the body before infection has taken place, by destroying the agents once they have entered the body before the disease has fully developed, or by immunizing susceptible populations against the effects. A range of light-based technologies may have a role to play in biodefense countermeasures. Germicidal UV (UVC) is exceptionally active in destroying a wide range of viruses and microbial cells, and recent data suggests that UVC has high selectivity over host mammalian cells and tissues. Two UVA mediated approaches may also have roles to play; one where UVA is combined with titanium dioxide nanoparticles in a process called photocatalysis, and a second where UVA is combined with psoralens (PUVA) to produce \u201Ckilled but metabolically active\u201D microbial cells that may be particularly suitable for vaccines. Many microbial cells are surprisingly sensitive to blue light alone, and blue light can effectively destroy bacteria, fungi, and Bacillus spores and can treat wound infections. The combination of photosensitizing dyes such as porphyrins or phenothiaziniums and red light is called photodynamic therapy (PDT) or photoinactivation, and this approach cannot only kill bacteria, spores, and fungi, but also inactivate viruses and toxins. Many reports have highlighted the ability of PDT to treat infections and stimulate the host immune system. Finally pulsed (femtosecond) high power lasers have been used to inactivate pathogens with some degree of selectivity. We have pointed to some of the ways light-based technology may be used to defeat biological warfare in the future.","publish_time":"2013-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vatansever, Fatma; Ferraresi, Cleber; de Sousa, Marcelo Victor Pires; Yin, Rui; Rineh, Ardeshir; Sharma, Sulbha K; Hamblin, Michael R","journal":"Virulence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c819d4002a693bae0a39b5d0a282c4feac3f184.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3925713.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24067444/; https://doi.org/10.4161/viru.26475","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Germicidal UV","UVC","UVA","PDT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microbial cells","bacteria","fungi","blue light","host mammalian cells","red light","high selectivity","UVC","Bacillus spores","appropriate dissemination of viruses","wide range of viruses","Biological warfare","body","agents","toxins","UVA mediated approaches","range of light-based technologies","civilian populations","degree of selectivity","wound infections","susceptible populations","ability of PDT","biodefense countermeasures","high power lasers","host immune system","ways light-based technology","porphyrins","phenothiaziniums","recent data","unpleasant fact","photodynamic therapy","titanium dioxide nanoparticles","combat personnel","process","photoinactivation","photocatalysis","bioterrorism","roles","tissues","combination of photosensitizing dyes","contamination of food","virulent diseases","century life","pathogens","femtosecond","place","Germicidal UV","surfaces","effects","reports","psoralens","PUVA","future","vaccines"],"language":"en"},

Methods The study examined health care worker adherence to CDC recommended respiratory infection control practices in primary care clinics and emergency departments of 5 medical centers in King County, Washington, using a self-administered questionnaire. All clinical, allied, and administrative health care workers in study settings were invited to participate: 653 (53%) responded, and 630 were included. Results The survey revealed important shortcomings in overall personal and institutional use of CDC recommended practices, including deficiencies in posted alerts, patient masking and separation, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, staff training, and written procedures. Use of recommended measures was generally higher among nursing staff than medical practitioners. Conclusion This study found significant gaps in adherence to CDC recommendations for the control of respiratory infections in ambulatory care clinical settings.

For example, it is likely that the immune-inflammatory response to respiratory syncytial virus can cause a predisposition toward an intense inflammatory reaction associated with asthma, and adenovirus might cause exacerbation of the immune response associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In each of these situations, the host\u0027s immune response plays a critical mechanistic role through the production of certain cytokines and chemokines. Specific aspects of these augmented immune responses are determined by the biology of the virus, the genetic variability of the host, and the cytokine-chemokine phenotype of the involved tissue. For instance, the type 1/type 2 cytokine ratio in the airways during infection with rhinovirus determines how long the viral infection endures. By this same theory, it has been demonstrated that chemokine levels produced during respiratory syncytial virus infection determine host responses to later immune stimuli in the lung, with the potential to augment the asthmatic response. Further research in this area will clarify cytokines, chemokines, or cell targets, which will provide the basis for next-generation therapies.","publish_time":"2006-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schaller, Matthew; Hogaboam, Cory M.; Lukacs, Nicholas; Kunkel, Steven L.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8df1fc06e3534daffa2319651fc530212f948528.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172995.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674906013157; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674906013157","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune-inflammatory response","host\u0027s immune response","immune stimuli","host response mechanisms","asthmatic response","respiratory syncytial virus infection","augmented immune responses","host responses","viral infection","chemokines","respiratory vial infections","subsequent exacerbation of asthma","cytokine-chemokine phenotype","cytokine ratio","chemokine levels","production of certain cytokines","intense inflammatory reaction","critical mechanistic role","intensity","predisposition","airways","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","rhinovirus","Specific aspects","adenovirus","biology","involved tissue","number of investigations","cell targets","genetic variability","basis","area","potential","lung","situations","generation therapies","research","instance","example","theory"],"language":"en"},

To understand its pathogenesis, we developed an animal model using BALB/c mice and the mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We examined the immune responses to SARS-CoV in both young and adult mice. SARS-CoV induced severe respiratory illness in all adult, but not young, mice on day 2 after inoculation with a mortality rate of 30 to 50%. Moribund adult mice showed severe pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage accompanied by virus replication. Adult murine lungs, which had significantly higher interleukin (IL)-4 and lower IL-10 and IL-13 levels before infection than young murine lungs, rapidly produced high levels of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines known to induce macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and activation (eg, tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1). On day 2 after inoculation, young murine lungs produced not only proinflammatory cytokines but also IL-2, interferon-\u03B3, IL-10, and IL-13. Adult mice showed early and acute excessive proinflammatory responses (ie, cytokine storm) in the lungs after SARS-CoV infection, which led to severe pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage. Intravenous injection with anti-tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 antibody 3 hours after infection had no effect on SARS-CoV infection. However, intraperitoneal interferon-\u03B3 injection protected adult mice from the lethal respiratory illness.

However, little is known about the regulatory role of autophagy in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) replication. In this study, we found that TGEV infection increased the number of autophagosome-like double- and single-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of host cells, a phenomenon that is known to be related to autophagy. In addition, virus replication was required for the increased amount of the autophagosome marker protein LC3-II. Autophagic flux occurred in TGEV-infected cells, suggesting that TGEV infection triggered a complete autophagic response. When autophagy was pharmacologically inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002, TGEV replication increased. The increase in virus yield via autophagy inhibition was further confirmed by the use of siRNA duplexes, through which three proteins required for autophagy were depleted. Furthermore, TGEV replication was inhibited when autophagy was activated by rapamycin. The antiviral response of autophagy was confirmed by using siRNA to reduce the expression of gene p300, which otherwise inhibits autophagy. Together, the results indicate that TGEV infection activates autophagy and that autophagy then inhibits further TGEV replication.","publish_time":"2016-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Longjun; Yu, Haidong; Gu, Weihong; Luo, Xiaolei; Li, Ren; Zhang, Jian; Xu, Yunfei; Yang, Lijun; Shen, Nan; Feng, Li; Wang, Yue","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/668aeb98c355caf8edcbbcb808215f26e7c388ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4814908.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep23864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27029407/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Autophagy","TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV replication","autophagy inhibition","TGEV infection","antiviral response of autophagy","regulatory role of autophagy","virus replication","TGEV-infected cells","virus yield","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","complete autophagic response","number of autophagosome","Autophagic flux","cytoplasm of host cells","use of siRNA duplexes","autophagosome marker protein LC3","single-membrane vesicles","double","innate immune defense","increase","wortmannin","expression of gene p300","viruses","phenomenon","proteins","LY294002","results","ancient pathway","addition","study","rapamycin"],"language":"en"},

Methods A mathematical model was utilized to fit the monthly case data, in order to estimate the turning points (peak incidence) and the reproduction number R of the outbreak. Furthermore, correlation analysis was carried out to assess the correlation between infections among the male and female IDUs. Results Model fit revealed a two-wave epidemic during April 2004\u2013March 2007. The larger second wave started shortly after May 2005 and peaked in October 2005 before gradually subsiding. R was estimated to be 3.15 (3.14\u20133.16) and 27.21 (26.73\u201328.05) for the two respective waves.

Conclusions The modeling results revealed the presence of a small first wave in 2004, before an explosion of cases after May 2005. Furthermore, a harm reduction program implemented in August 2005 contributed to the downturn in the epidemic after October.

Some of the HmAbs were S1 domain specific, while some were not. In this study, we describe non-S1 binding neutralizing HmAbs that can specifically bind to the conserved S2 domain of the S protein. However, unlike the S1 specific HmAbs, the S2 specific HmAbs can neutralize pseudotyped viruses expressing different S proteins containing receptor binding domain sequences of various clinical isolates. These data indicate that HmAbs which bind to conserved regions of the S protein are more suitable for conferring protection against a wide range of SARS-CoV variants and have implications for generating therapeutic antibodies or subunit vaccines against other enveloped viruses.","publish_time":"2012-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elshabrawy, Hatem A.; Coughlin, Melissa M.; Baker, Susan C.; Prabhakar, Bellur S.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/697b9d764f13648fa38faa8d93fefde6049d6517.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3503966.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0050366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23185609/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjsyNjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","Amgen British Columbia Inc","HmAbs"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S1 specific HmAbs","S2 specific HmAbs","S1 domain specific","non-S1 binding neutralizing HmAbs","SARS-CoV spike","human monoclonal antibodies","conserved S2 domain","different S proteins","wide range of SARS","therapeutic antibodies","CoV variants","treatment of patients","pseudotyped viruses","enveloped viruses","convalescent patients","Immune sera","conserved regions","receptor binding domain sequences of various clinical isolates","passive immune therapy","attractive treatment strategy","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus","conferring protection","implications","subunit vaccines","Xenomouse","Amgen British Columbia","study","ectodomain","glycoprotein","panel","data"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: To describe urban-rural disparity in UGIC and to emphasize prevention by socioeconomic development and urbanization in China. METHODS: Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) of cancers in 2012 were compared between urban Shijiazhuang city and rural Shexian County, and trends from 2000-2015 in Shexian County were analyzed. FINDINGS: Compared with urban Shijiazhuang city, the ASR of gastroesophageal cancers in rural Shexian County was 5.3 times higher in men (234.1 vs 44.2/100,000, P \u003C .01) and 9.1 times higher in women (107.7 vs 11.8/100,000, P \u003C .01). This rural-urban disparity in UGIC is associated with differences in socioeconomic development in annual gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$2700 vs US$6965, in urbanization rate of 48% vs 100%, and in adult Helicobacter pylori infection prevalence of 75% vs 50%. From 2000-2015, the GDP per capita in Shexian County increased from US$860 to US$3000, urbanization rate increased from 22.4% to 54.8%, and prevalence of H pylori infection among 3- to 10-year-old children decreased from 60% to 46.1% (P \u003C .01). Meanwhile, the biennial ASR of esophagogastric cancer decreased 42% in men, from 313.5 to 182.1 per 100,000 (P \u003C .01), and 57% in women, from 188.6 to 80.4 per 100,000 (P = .00). However, lung, colorectal, and gallbladder cancers and leukemia in both sexes and breast, ovary, thyroid, and kidney cancer in women increased significantly. Despite this offset, ASR of all cancers combined decreased 25% in men (from 378.2 to 283.0/100,000, P = .00) and 19% in women (from 238.5 to 193.6/100,000, P = .00). CONCLUSIONS: Urban-rural disparity in UGIC is related to inequity in socioeconomic development. Economic growth and urbanization is effective for prevention in endemic regions in China and should be a policy priority.","publish_time":"2017-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Xiaoduo; Wen, Denggui; Yang, Yi; Chen, Yuetong; Wang, Guiying; Shan, Baoen","journal":"Ann Glob Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0eb47b7ae70c3436d61e56125e4b06e435075a81.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185469.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aogh.2017.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29221517/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214999617306495; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214999617306495","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjszMDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Globally China","UGIC","ASR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["rural-urban disparity","urban-rural difference","rural Shexian County","largest urban-rural disparity","vs US","UGIC","socioeconomic development","women","urban Shijiazhuang city","China","urbanization rate","ASR of gastroesophageal cancers","gallbladder cancers","prevention","kidney cancer","times higher","biennial ASR of esophagogastric cancer","GDP","prevalence of H pylori infection","upper gastrointestinal cancer","adult Helicobacter pylori infection prevalence","annual gross domestic product","sexes","thyroid","differences","Age-standardized incidence rates","ovary","leukemia","ASRs","endemic regions","METHODS","breast","inequity","trends","Economic growth","lung","FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS","policy priority","BACKGROUND","offset","OBJECTIVES","year-old children","countries"],"language":"en"},

Here, we present a stochastic susceptible\u2013infected\u2013susceptible (SIS) epidemic model incorporating media coverage and environmental fluctuations. By using Feller\u2019s test and stochastic comparison principle, we establish the stochastic basic reproduction number R 0 s , which completely determines whether the disease is persistent or not in the population. If R 0 s \u2264 1 , the disease will go to extinction; if R 0 s = 1 , the disease will also go to extinction in probability, which has not been reported in the known literatures; and if R 0 s \u003E 1 , the disease will be stochastically persistent. In addition, the existence of the stationary distribution of the model and its ergodicity are obtained. Numerical simulations based on real examples support the theoretical results. The interesting findings are that (i) the environmental fluctuation may significantly affect the threshold dynamical behavior of the disease and the fluctuations in different size scale population, and (ii) the media coverage plays an important role in affecting the stationary distribution of disease under a low intensity noise environment.","publish_time":"2018-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Yu; Zhang, Liping; Yuan, Sanling","journal":"Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7ff84fba197a55522166ddd7f67f92ac98dc8870.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125822.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437118310562; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2018.08.113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288106/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437118310562","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stationary distribution of disease","effect of media coverage","Abstract Media coverage","stochastic environment","stochastic basic reproduction number R","stochastic comparison principle","environmental fluctuations","extinction","epidemic model","important role","infectious diseases","important measures","low intensity noise environment","different size scale population","SIS","real examples","threshold dynamical behavior","Feller\u2019s test","Numerical simulations","theoretical results","existence","known literatures","addition","ergodicity","interesting findings","probability"],"language":"en"},

Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), fuse at the plasma membrane or use receptor-mediated endocytosis and fuse with endosomes depending on the cell or tissue type. The virus Spike (S) protein mediates fusion with the host cell membrane. We have shown previously that an Abl kinase inhibitor, imatinib, significantly reduces SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral titers and prevents endosomal entry by HIV SARS S and MERS S pseudotyped virions. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are classified as BSL-3 viruses, which can make experimentation into the cellular mechanisms involved in infection more challenging. Here, we use IBV, a BSL-2 virus, as a model for studying the role of Abl kinase activity during coronavirus infection. We found that imatinib and two specific Abl kinase inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, reduce IBV titers by blocking the first round of virus infection. Additionally, all three drugs prevented IBV S-induced syncytia formation prior to the hemifusion step. Our results indicate that membrane fusion (both virus-cell and cell-cell) is blocked in the presence of Abl kinase inhibitors. Studying the effects of Abl kinase inhibitors on IBV will be useful in identifying host cell pathways required for coronavirus infection. This will provide insight into possible therapeutic targets to treat infections by current as well as newly emerging coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2018-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sisk, Jeanne M.; Frieman, Matthew B.; Machamer, Carolyn E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4f392ef1aa2234dda52ab8e6540f275322a20697.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f804207c571ddacda454d3129c899f838fcd28ce.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/246991","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs0NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["cell-cell","virus-cell","SARS-CoV","host cell membrane","coronavirus infection","round of virus infection","IBV titers","specific Abl kinase inhibitors","effects of Abl kinase inhibitors","presence of Abl kinase inhibitors","virus Spike","virus replication","host cell pathways","MERS-CoV viral titers","HIV SARS S","role of Abl kinase activity","infectious bronchitis virus","MERS S pseudotyped virions","membrane fusion","IBV S-induced syncytia formation","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","host cells","fuse","imatinib","plasma membrane","BSL","endosomal entry","cellular membranes","hemifusion step","cellular mechanisms","Enveloped viruses","emerging coronaviruses","GNF2","GNF5","protein","receptor-mediated endocytosis","endosomes","possible therapeutic targets","infections","drugs","insight","experimentation","model","tissue type","results"],"language":"en"},

Assay conditions for the primers and probe were optimized using infected PK15 cells and ten-fold serial dilutions of a plasmid containing the whole P-gene. The sensitivity of the developed TaqMan\u00AE assay was approximately 10 plasmid copies per reaction, and was shown to be 1000 fold better than a conventional nested RT-PCR.

A novel coronavirus wassubsequently identified as the causative pathogenand provisionally designated 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV).1As of February 10, 2020, 42,638 casesof 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed inChina, with 21,675 suspected cases and 1016 deaths.There are still more than 3000 confirmed cases everyday, involving people living in or visiting Wuhan,as a subsequent characteristic of human-to-humantransmission. 2019-nCoV continues to spread aroundthe world and has been reported in other countriessuch as the United States.2Hospitals in all provincesand cities across China have taken effective measuresto control the spread of 2019-nCoV.On January 24, 2020, the West China Hospital ofSichuan University temporarily shut the doorsof its dermatology outpatient department anddermatology surgery by postponing all of theelective operations and limiting to only emergencyoperations. We did not, however, completely haltthe services to some patients who need to visitthe dermatology outpatient department during the2019-nCoV outbreak. At the same time, to meet themedical requirements and reduce the flow of patientsto the skin clinic, we began free online and telephoneconsultation by providing free dermatology consulta-tions. The dermatology outpatient department in WestChina Hospital was scheduled to run on January 28,2020, mainly for critical care patients. Patients whohad made an advanced appointment for obtainingmedical service but chose not to visit received a fullrefund of registration fees.The number of dermatology outpatient clinics hasbeen drastically reduced from 8 to 4, and only 1accompanying person is allowed to enter the clinic.People entering the outpatient and inpatient buildingsmust wear masks and have their body temperaturemonitored by professionals wearing tight protectiveclothing. At the entrance of the building, anyone witha fever (body temperature$37.38C), travel history toWuhan in last 2 weeks, clear contact with residents inWuhan in last 2 weeks, or contact with people with afever would be directly sent to the fever clinic forscreening. These individuals are considered to havebeen exposed and are quarantined for 2 weeks, andpotential exposures are also asked to quarantinethemselves for 2 weeks at home.During the skin clinic, patients are not allowed totake off their masks except on indications of faciallesions. Doctors must wear masks, surgical caps,protective suits, gloves, and goggles at work; theytake off their protective equipment only after theirwork in a designated disposable area.In other respects, educational programs andactivities of West China Hospital have come to ahalt; graduate students and interns are prohibitedfrom returning to school and work. Also, West ChinaHospital established special psychologic interventioncounseling via a telephone and network platform tohelp those in need and published a psychologicprotection handbook for free download.It is uncertain to predict when the 2019-nCoV willend at the time of this writing. The West Chinahospital is still playing a powerful role in defendingagainst the epidemic outbreak and is a microcosm ofall of the countless Chinese hospitals at this moment.","publish_time":"2020-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Joob, Beuy; Wiwanitkit, Viroj","journal":"J Am Acad Dermatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a9c63b9481a0067318df5bebdbe8403aad76d62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156802.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.03.036; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962220304540; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0190962220304540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213305/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University","West Chinahospital"],"locations":["United States","West China","China"],"keyphrases":["weeks","visitthe dermatology outpatient department","nCoV infection","nCoV willend","dermatology outpatient department anddermatology surgery","West ChinaHospital","skin clinic","masks","the2019-nCoV outbreak","people","number of dermatology outpatient clinics hasbeen","West China Hospital ofSichuan University","free dermatology consulta-tions","Patients whohad","educational programs andactivities of West China Hospital","fever clinic forscreening","WestChina Hospital","free download","novel coronavirus","critical care patients","need","time","individuals","spread","confirmed cases everyday","body temperature","protective suits","protective equipment","epidemic outbreak","witha fever","residents inWuhan","suspected cases","clear contact","countless Chinese hospitals","designated disposable area","doorsof","respects","microcosm ofall","gloves","surgical caps","provincesand cities","special psychologic interventioncounseling","ahalt","travel history toWuhan","interns","prohibitedfrom","network platform tohelp","advanced appointment","theirwork","goggles","telephoneconsultation","graduate students","United States","flow of patientsto","effective measuresto","powerful role","causative pathogenand","building","theytake","fullrefund of registration fees","psychologicprotection handbook","inChina","totake","obtainingmedical service","theelective operations","themedical requirements","subsequent characteristic of human","professionals","tight protectiveclothing","school","countriessuch","moment","Doctors","pneumonia","home","indications of faciallesions","humantransmission","emergencyoperations","entrance","deaths","writing","andpotential exposures","haltthe services","aroundthe world","casesof","accompanying person","havebeen","afever"],"language":"en"},

Several studies have used different model cell lines to exhibit the cytotoxicity of Ag-NPs, and their underlying molecular mechanisms. This review aimed to elucidate different properties of Ag-NPs that are responsible for the induction of cellular toxicity along with the critical mechanism of action and subsequent defense mechanisms observed in vitro. Our results show that the properties of Ag-NPs largely vary based on the diversified synthesis processes. The physiochemical properties of Ag-NPs (e.g., size, shape, concentration, agglomeration, or aggregation interaction with a biological system) can cause impairment of mitochondrial function prior to their penetration and accumulation in the mitochondrial membrane. Thus, Ag-NPs exhibit properties that play a central role in their use as biocides along with their applicability in environmental cleaning.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the first viral pathogen confirmed to be widely transmissible in animal food. Because the potential for viral contamination in animal food is not well characterized, the objectives of this study were to 1) observe the magnitude of virus contamination in an animal food manufacturing facility, and 2) investigate a proposed method, feed sequencing, to decrease virus decontamination on animal food-contact surfaces. A U.S. virulent PEDV isolate was used to inoculate 50 kg swine feed, which was mixed, conveyed, and discharged into bags using pilot-scale feed manufacturing equipment. Surfaces were swabbed and analyzed for the presence of PEDV RNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Environmental swabs indicated complete contamination of animal food-contact surfaces (0/40 vs. 48/48, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P \u003C 0.05) and near complete contamination of non-animal food-contact surfaces (0/24 vs. 16/18, positive baseline samples/total baseline samples, positive subsequent samples/total subsequent samples, respectively; P \u003C 0.05). Flushing animal food-contact surfaces with low-risk feed is commonly used to reduce cross-contamination in animal feed manufacturing. Thus, four subsequent 50 kg batches of virus-free swine feed were manufactured using the same system to test its impact on decontaminating animal food-contact surfaces. Even after 4 subsequent sequences, animal food-contact surfaces retained viral RNA (28/33 positive samples/total samples), with conveying system being more contaminated than the mixer. A bioassay to test infectivity of dust from animal food-contact surfaces failed to produce infectivity. This study demonstrates the potential widespread viral contamination of surfaces in an animal food manufacturing facility and the difficulty of removing contamination using conventional feed sequencing, which underscores the importance for preventing viruses from entering and contaminating such facilities.","publish_time":"2017-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schumacher, Loni L.; Huss, Anne R.; Cochrane, Roger A.; Stark, Charles R.; Woodworth, Jason C.; Bai, Jianfa; Poulsen, Elizabeth G.; Chen, Qi; Main, Rodger G.; Zhang, Jianqiang; Gauger, Phillip C.; Ramirez, Alejandro; Derscheid, Rachel J.; Magstadt, Drew M.; Dritz, Steve S.; Jones, Cassandra K.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0acb3cda6288d12ce50136a88c013a3098ee3fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5667810.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29095859/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187309","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["decontaminating animal food-contact surfaces","Flushing animal food-contact surfaces","complete contamination of animal food-contact surfaces","animal feed manufacturing","animal food manufacturing facility","total samples","positive samples","importance of animal feed","complete contamination of non-animal food-contact surfaces","total subsequent samples","positive subsequent samples","total baseline samples","positive baseline samples","potential widespread viral contamination of surfaces","national food safety system","cross-contamination","magnitude of virus contamination","conventional feed sequencing","free swine feed","subsequent sequences","low-risk feed","viral RNA","pilot-scale feed manufacturing equipment","virus decontamination","batches of virus","viral pathogen","presence of PEDV RNA","conveying system","study","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","virulent PEDV isolate","infectivity of dust","quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","difficulty","consumer demands","qPCR","impact","Environmental swabs","bags","proposed method","viruses","bioassay","mixer","facilities","objectives"],"language":"en"},

There is a great deal of interest and concern at the rate at which new pathogens are emerging and causing significant human health problems. Expanding our understanding of how cells regulate signaling networks to defend against invaders and retain cell homeostasis will reveal promising strategies against infection. It has taken scientists decades to appreciate that eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) play a role as global cell signaling mediators to regulate cell homeostasis, beyond their intrinsic function as protein synthesis enzymes. Recent discoveries revealed that ubiquitously expressed standby cytoplasmic ARSs sense and respond to danger signals and regulate immunity against infections, indicating their potential as therapeutic targets for infectious diseases. In this review, we discuss ARS-mediated anti-infectious signaling and the emerging role of ARSs in antimicrobial immunity. In contrast to their ability to defend against infection, host ARSs are inevitably co-opted by viruses for survival and propagation. We therefore provide a brief overview of the communication between viruses and the ARS system. Finally, we discuss encouraging new approaches to develop ARSs as therapeutics for infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Eun-Young; Kim, Sunghoon; Kim, Myung Hee","journal":"Biochemical Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c5a1c8812eed6acb2b0bab18273f730512445097.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092877.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295218302181; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2018.06.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29890143/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006295218302181","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host ARSs","emerging role of ARSs","infectious diseases","cell homeostasis","infection-associated diseases","global cell","standby cytoplasmic ARSs sense","viruses","antimicrobial immunity","new pathogens","new approaches","ARS system","medical science","intrinsic function","potential","danger signals","eukaryotic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases","infections","remarkable advances","communication","mediators","therapeutics","therapeutic targets","protein synthesis enzymes","Abstract","concern","promising strategies","significant human health problems","leading causes of death","networks","scientists decades","brief overview","ability","invaders","Recent discoveries","understanding","cells","great deal","survival","propagation","contrast","review"],"language":"en"},

However, application of previously developed vaccines for preventing CDI has been limited due to various reasons. Here, we developed a recombinant Lactococcus lactis oral vaccine and evaluated its effect on a C. difficile-infected animal model established in golden hamsters in attempt to provide an alternative strategy for CDI prevention. METHODS: Recombinant L. lactis vaccine was developed using the pTRKH2 plasmid, a high-copy-number Escherichia coli-L. shuttle vector: 1) L. lactis expressing secreted proteins was constructed with recombinant pTRKH2 (secreted-protein plasmid) carrying the Usp45 signal peptide (SPUsp45), nontoxic adjuvanted tetanus toxin fragment C (TETC), and 14 of the 38 C-terminal repeats (14CDTA) of nontoxic C. difficile toxin A (TcdA); and 2) L. lactis expressing secreted and membrane proteins was constructed with recombinant pTRKH2 (membrane-anchored plasmid) carrying SPUsp45, TETC, 14CDTA, and the cell wall-anchored sequence of protein M6 (cwaM6). Then, 32 male Syrian golden hamsters were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8 each) for gavage of normal saline (blank control) and L. lactis carrying the empty shuttle vector, secreted-protein plasmid, and membrane-anchored plasmid, respectively. After 1-week gavage of clindamycin, the animals were administered with C. difficile spore suspension. General symptoms and intestinal pathological changes of the animals were examined by naked eye and microscopy, respectively. Protein levels of anti-TcdA IgG/IgA antibodies in intestinal tissue and fluid were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay was done by TcdA treatment with or without anti-TcdA serum pre-incubation or treatment. Apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells was examined by flow cytometry (FL) assay. Expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines in the animals was detected by polymer chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: After the C. difficile challenge, the animals of control group had severe diarrhea symptoms on day 1 and all died on day 4, indicating that the CDI animal model was established in hamster. Of the 3 immunization groups, secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups had significantly lower mortalities, body weight decreases, and pathological scores, with higher survival rate/time than the empty plasmid group (P \u003C 0.05). The tilter of IgG antibody directed against TcdA was significantly higher in serum and intestinal fluid of secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups than in the empty plasmid group (P \u003C 0.05) while the corresponding titer of IgA antibody directed against TcdA had no substantial differences (P \u003E 0.05). The anti-TcdA serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group neutralized the cytotoxicity of 200 ng/ml TcdA with the best protective effect achieved by anti-TcdA serum pre-incubation. The incidences of TcdA-induced death and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells were significantly reduced by cell pre-incubation or treatment with anti-TcdA serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group (P \u003C 0.05). MCP-1, ICAM-1, IL-6, and Gro-1 mRNA expression levels were the lowest in cecum tissue of the membrane-anchored groups compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: Recombinant L. lactis live vaccine is effective for preventing CDI in the hamster model, thus providing an alternative for immunization of C. difficile-associated diseases.","publish_time":"2013-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Xiao-qiang; Zhao, Ya-gang; Chen, Xue-qing; Jiang, Bo; Sun, Da-yong","journal":"BMC Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec2b2544b77c203db7fb59fbcb3f2c12733685e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3750240.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-230x-13-117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23865596/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Recombinant L."],"organizations":["CDI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["membrane-anchored plasmid groups","secreted-protein plasmid","membrane-anchored groups","anti-TcdA serum of membrane","TcdA treatment","pTRKH2 plasmid","incidences of TcdA","anti-TcdA serum pre-incubation","Protein levels of anti-TcdA IgG","membrane proteins","lactis vaccine","immunization groups","intestinal fluid of secreted","recombinant pTRKH2","difficile toxin","secreted proteins","animals of control group","intestinal tissue","difficile challenge","CDI prevention","recombinant Lactococcus lactis oral vaccine","cell wall-anchored sequence of protein M6","lactis live vaccine","CDI animal model","cell pre-incubation","difficile-infected animal model","immunization of","Apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells","intestinal pathological changes","difficile-associated diseases","difficile spore suspension","prevention of Clostridium difficile infection","Oral immunization","hamster model","developed vaccines","cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay","SPUsp45","effective strategy","CDTA","shuttle vector","alternative strategy","TETC","day","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","mRNA expression levels","tilter of IgG antibody","pathological scores","IgA antibodies","nontoxic adjuvanted tetanus toxin fragment C","cecum tissue","blank control","corresponding titer of IgA antibody","General symptoms","male Syrian golden hamsters","best protective effect","higher survival rate","severe diarrhea symptoms","gavage of normal saline","C-terminal repeats","week gavage of clindamycin","Expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines","lower mortalities","body weight decreases","induced death","number Escherichia coli-","high-copy","Usp45 signal peptide","flow cytometry","polymer chain reaction","attempt","time","ELISA","PCR","cwaM6","CONCLUSION","substantial differences","naked eye","BACKGROUND","METHODS","ICAM","microscopy","RESULTS","application","various reasons","MCP"],"language":"en"},

In this study, reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) was combined with lateral flow dipstick (LFD) forming a novel detection tool which could simultaneously detect IBV and NDV visually. Primers targeted the 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) of IBV genome and the conserved region of NDV large polymerase gene (LP). The specificity and sensitivity of this multiple reverse transcription-LAMP-LFD (mRT-LAMP-LFD) assay were compared with those of conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR (nRT-PCR), quantification RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and RT-LAMP monitored by electrophoresis. No non-specific amplifications were observed when the assays were tested with unrelated viruses. According to the sensitivity study, when detecting IBV or NDV alone, the lowest detection limits of mRT-LAMP-LFD were 100.8 IBV RNA copies/reaction and 100.7 NDV RNA copies/reaction. Furthermore, when detecting IBV and NDV simultaneously, the lowest detection limit was the same as that of the single detection assays. In the clinical sample study, mRT-LAMP-LFD performed the best among these assays. When tested with IBV or NDV single infected samples, the mean detection rates were 98.65% and 97.25%, respectively. In the IBV and NDV co-infected sample study, the mean detection rates of IBV and NDV were both 95%. This study showed that mRT-LAMP-LFD was a promising qualitative detection tool suitable for field single or multiple IBV and NDV detection.","publish_time":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Xuan; Song, Zengxu; Zhai, Xiwen; Zuo, Lei; Mei, Xueran; Xiang, Rong; Kang, Zhuangzhuang; Zhou, Long; Wang, Hongning","journal":"Poultry Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55a9ed6ed8fbd77c18d5d42e3dba9121a22e8e07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107193.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265112/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003257911945743X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003257911945743X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","IBV","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NDV detection","LAMP-LFD","mRT-LAMP","multiple IBV","mean detection rates of IBV","IBV genome","NDV RNA copies","IBV RNA copies","single detection assays","NDV single infected samples","reverse-transcription LAMP","NDV co-infected sample study","lowest detection limits of mRT","nested RT-PCR","conventional RT-PCR","quantification RT-PCR","novel detection tool","multiple reverse transcription-LAMP","sensitivity study","nRT-PCR","qRT-PCR","conserved region of NDV large polymerase gene","clinical sample study","promising qualitative detection tool suitable","field single","reaction","untranslated region","important viruses","unrelated viruses","Newcastle disease virus","ABSTRACT Infectious bronchitis virus","LP","UTR","lateral flow dipstick","poultry industry","specificity","best","non-specific amplifications","electrophoresis","Primers"],"language":"en"},

Characterization of AlsPV by whole-genome sequencing and analyzing antigenic relatedness revealed it is a rubulavirus that is closely related to parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5). Intranasal exposure of mice to AlsPV resulted in no clinical signs of disease, although viral RNA was detected in the olfactory bulbs of two mice at 21 days post exposure. Oronasal challenge of ferrets resulted in subclinical upper respiratory tract infection, viral shedding in respiratory secretions, and detection of viral antigen in the olfactory bulb of the brain. These results imply that AlsPV may be similar to PIV5 in its ability to infect multiple mammalian host species.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic in 2002\u20132003, and the recent emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in April 2012, emphasize the high probability of future zoonotic HCoV emergence causing severe and lethal human disease. Additionally, the resistance of SARS-CoV to ribavirin (RBV) demonstrates the need to define new targets for inhibition of CoV replication. CoVs express a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication and is conserved across the CoV family. All genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN has an RNA proofreading function. Thus, we hypothesized that ExoN is responsible for CoV resistance to RNA mutagens. We demonstrate that while wild-type (ExoN\u002B) CoVs were resistant to RBV and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), CoVs lacking ExoN activity (ExoN\u2212) were up to 300-fold more sensitive. While the primary antiviral activity of RBV against CoVs was not mutagenesis, ExoN\u2212 CoVs treated with 5-FU demonstrated both enhanced sensitivity during multi-cycle replication, as well as decreased specific infectivity, consistent with 5-FU functioning as a mutagen. Comparison of full-genome next-generation sequencing of 5-FU treated SARS-CoV populations revealed a 16-fold increase in the number of mutations within the ExoN\u2212 population as compared to ExoN\u002B. Ninety percent of these mutations represented A:G and U:C transitions, consistent with 5-FU incorporation during RNA synthesis. Together our results constitute direct evidence that CoV ExoN activity provides a critical proofreading function during virus replication. Furthermore, these studies identify ExoN as the first viral protein distinct from the RdRp that determines the sensitivity of RNA viruses to mutagens. Finally, our results show the importance of ExoN as a target for inhibition, and suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of ExoN activity could be potential pan-CoV therapeutics in combination with RBV or RNA mutagens.","publish_time":"2013-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Everett Clinton; Blanc, Herv\u00E9; Vignuzzi, Marco; Denison, Mark R.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/68422d2849ca1b297e561f73160f9a74a7077797.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3744431.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23966862/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV ExoN activity","nsp14-ExoN","importance of ExoN","CoV resistance","MERS-CoV","inhibition of CoV replication","CoV family","SARS-CoV populations","small-molecule inhibitors of ExoN activity","RNA mutagens","potential pan-CoV therapeutics","FU incorporation","RNA proofreading function","FU functioning","RNA synthesis","sensitivity of RNA viruses","primary antiviral activity of RBV","resistance of SARS","virus replication","high-fidelity replication","multi-cycle replication","results","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus","critical proofreading function","recent emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","enhanced sensitivity","human coronaviruses","number of mutations","nonstructural protein","fold increase","lethal human disease","viral protein distinct","high probability of future zoonotic HCoV emergence","combination","need","hypothesis","RdRp","new targets","ribavirin","direct evidence","C transitions","biochemical data","mutagenesis","generation sequencing","genome","vaccines","exoribonuclease","specific infectivity","fluorouracil","epidemic","wild-type","HCoVs","studies","Comparison","percent"],"language":"en"},

The oocyst numbers and fecal consistency scores were statistically compared between the groups. Ninety one percent of the calves shed Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts during the trial. The full dose group had a longer prepatent period than the control group, but no statistical difference in the number of oocysts was identified between the groups after controlling for the effects of sex and breed. The fecal consistency scores and mortality rates did not differ between the groups. These results indicated that the anti-Cryptosporidium activity and clinical benefit of HL were limited.

Failure by the microarray to identify a base, compared to the reference sequence, is designated an \u0027N-call.\u0027 This study re-examined the N-call distribution of mtDNA samples sequenced by the Affymetrix MitoChip v.2.0, based on the hypothesis that N-calls may represent insertions or deletions (indels) in mtDNA. FINDINGS: We analysed 16 patient mtDNA samples using MitoChip. N-calls by the proprietary GSEQ software were significantly reduced when either of the freeware on-line algorithms ResqMi or sPROFILER was utilized. With sPROFILER, this decrease in N-calls had no effect on the homoplasmic or heteroplasmic mutation levels compared to GSEQ software, but ResqMi produced a significant change in mutation load, as well as producing longer N-cell stretches. For these reasons, further analysis using ResqMi was not attempted. Conventional DNA sequencing of the longer N-calls stretches from sPROFILER revealed 7 insertions and 12 point mutations. Moreover, analysis of single-base N-calls of one mtDNA sample found 3 other point mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to analyse N-calls produced from GSEQ software for the MitoChipv2.0. By narrowing the focus to longer stretches of N-calls revealed by sPROFILER, conventional sequencing was able to identify unique insertions and point mutations. Shorter N-calls also harboured point mutations, but the absence of deletions among N-calls suggests that probe confirmation affects binding and thus N-calling. This study supports the contention that the GSEQ is more capable of assigning bases when used in conjunction with sPROFILER.","publish_time":"2011-10-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zamzami, Mazin A; Price, Gareth R; Taylor, Robert W; Blakely, Emma L; Oancea, Iulia; Bowling, Francis; Duley, John A","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6518c58374cc315647f2873a234cfa983746bfd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3208482.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22011414/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-4-426","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Affymetrix","GSEQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["longer N-calls","base N-calls","Shorter N","longer N-cell","sPROFILER","point mutations","study","Conventional DNA sequencing","patient mtDNA samples","distribution of mtDNA samples","proprietary GSEQ software","conventional sequencing","mitochondrial DNA","mutation load","mutation detection","unique insertions","DNA resequencing microarrays","heteroplasmic mutation levels","absence of deletions","freeware on-line algorithms ResqMi","Affymetrix MitoChip","analysis of single","Developments","homoplasmic","effect","probe confirmation","significant change","capable of assigning bases","BACKGROUND","binding","conjunction","contention","indels","reference sequence","FINDINGS","reasons","MitoChipv2","hypothesis","Failure","CONCLUSIONS","focus"],"language":"en"},

The frequency of this event is highly regulated, and significant deviation from the normal 5\u201310% frequency has been demonstrated to decrease viral infectivity. Frameshifting is primarily regulated by the Frameshift Stimulatory Signal RNA (FSS-RNA), a thermodynamically stable, highly conserved stem loop that has been proposed as a therapeutic target. We describe the design, synthesis, and testing of a series of N-methyl peptides able to bind the HIV-1 FSS RNA stem loop with low nanomolar affinity and high selectivity. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data indicates increased affinity is a reflection of a substantially enhanced on rate. Compounds readily penetrate cell membranes and inhibit HIV infectivity in a pseudotyped virus assay. Viral infectivity inhibition correlates with compound-dependent changes in the ratios of Gag and Gag-Pol in virus particles. As the first compounds with both single digit nanomolar affinities for the FSS RNA and an ability to inhibit HIV in cells, these studies support the use of N-methylation for enhancing the affinity, selectivity, and bioactivity of RNA-binding peptides.","publish_time":"2015-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hilimire, Thomas A.; Bennett, Ryan P.; Stewart, Ryan A.; Garcia-Miranda, Pablo; Blume, Alex; Becker, Jordan; Sherer, Nathan; Helms, Eric D.; Butcher, Samuel E.; Smith, Harold C.; Miller, Benjamin L.","journal":"ACS Chem Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8604d285ad83e111704365b6dc4cc60e03d71b49.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9afb35f53239d7fc6c241632cef92d1ed9742ef6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4720131.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.5b00682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26496521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FSS RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FSS-RNA","HIV infectivity","FSS RNA stem loop","bioactivity of RNA","virus particles","Frameshift Stimulatory Signal RNA","low nanomolar affinity","increased affinity","Human Immunodeficiency Virus","pseudotyped virus assay","Compounds","event","frequency","Viral infectivity inhibition correlates","conserved stem loop","ratios of Gag","Gag-Pol","series of N","use of N","high selectivity","binding peptides","methyl peptides able","programmed ribosomal frameshift","single digit nanomolar affinities","data","compound-dependent changes","SPR","PRF","text","Surface plasmon resonance","testing","reflection","cells","studies","methylation","cell membranes","ability","significant deviation","synthesis","Image","enzymes","design","structural proteins","transcript","therapeutic target","rate","Frameshifting"],"language":"en"}]}

Prevention and control depend on awareness and protective behaviours of the general population as well as high risk-groups. This study aims to explore the knowledge, attitudes and practices related to avian influenza among poultry workers in Nepal. METHODS: The study was based on a cross-sectional study design, using a structured questionnaire administered in face-to-face interviews with 96 poultry workers age 15 and above from the Rupandehi district in Nepal. RESULTS: The majority of respondents were male (80%), mean age was 35 (SD = 11.6). Nearly everybody was aware that AI cases had been detected in Nepal and that poultry workers were at risk for infection. The major sources of AI information were radio, TV and newspapers. Knowledge about preventive measures was high with regard to some behaviours (hand washing), but medium to low with regard to others (using cleaning and disinfecting procedures or protective clothing). Poultry workers who got their information from TV and newspapers and those who were more afraid of contracting AI had higher knowledge than those who did not. Being employed as compared to being an owner of a poultry farm as well as having a high level of knowledge was associated with practising more preventive behaviours. While on one hand many specific government control measures found a high degree of acceptance, a majority of study participants also thought that government control and compensation measures as a whole were insufficient. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides information about knowledge and practices regarding avian influenza among poultry workers in Nepal. It highlights the importance of targeting lack of knowledge as well as structural-material barriers to successfully build preparedness for a major outbreak situation.","publish_time":"2012-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neupane, Dinesh; Khanal, Vishnu; Ghimire, Kamal; Aro, Arja R; Leppin, Anja","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c0ae4beee003ecb59ff15f81ed8f22cd9451353.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3342178.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22458535/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-12-76","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Rupandehi"],"keyphrases":["poultry workers age","Nepal","high level of knowledge","higher knowledge","poultry farm","Avian influenza","majority of study participants","preventive measures","protective behaviours","preventive behaviours","high risk-groups","cross-sectional study design","specific government control measures","major sources of AI information","importance of targeting lack of knowledge","practices","high degree of acceptance","compensation measures","regard","AI cases","TV","newspapers","afraid of contracting AI","protective clothing","hand washing","majority of respondents","mean age","major outbreak situation","considerable threat","face-to-face interviews","radio","structured questionnaire","general population","preparedness","cleaning","awareness","global public health","disinfecting procedures","practising","attitudes","structural-material barriers","male","BACKGROUND","infection","Rupandehi district","SD","RESULTS","Prevention","owner","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Objective We investigated whether the individual variation in antiviral response at birth determines the risk for acute respiratory tract illness in the first year of life. Methods We studied 82 children who were enrolled in a birth cohort study of inner-city children with at least 1 parent with allergy or asthma. We cultured cord blood monocytes and assessed IFNG and CCL5 mRNA production at 24 hours after inoculation with respiratory syncytial virus. We also monitored the frequency of acute respiratory tract illness at 3-month intervals and analyzed nasal lavage samples for respiratory tract viruses at the time of illness during the first year. Results Respiratory tract infection was reported for 88% of subjects, and respiratory tract viruses were recovered in 74% of symptomatic children. We observed a wide range of antiviral responses in cord blood monocytes across the population. Furthermore, a decrease in production of IFNG (but not CCL5) mRNA in response to respiratory syncytial virus infection of monocytes was associated with a significant increase in the frequency of upper respiratory tract infections (r = \u22120.42, P \u003C .001) and the prevalence of ear and sinus infections, pneumonias, and respiratory-related hospitalizations.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are the primary bacterial pathogens of otitis media and their loads predict clinical ear state. Our hypothesis is that antecedent respiratory viral infection increases bacterial density and progression to perforation. METHODS: A total of 366 nasopharyngeal swabs from 114 Indigenous children were retrospectively examined. A panel of 17 respiratory viruses was screened by PCR, and densities of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were estimated by quantitative real time PCR. Data are reported by clinical ear state. RESULTS: M. catarrhalis (96%), H. influenzae (91%), S. pneumoniae (89%) and respiratory viruses (59%) were common; including rhinovirus (HRV) (38%), polyomavirus (HPyV) (14%), adenovirus (HAdV) (13%), bocavirus (HBoV) (8%) and coronavirus (HCoV) (4%). Geometric mean bacterial loads were significantly higher in children with acute otitis media (AOM) compared to children without evidence of otitis media. Children infected with HAdV were 3 times more likely (p \u003C 0.001) to have AOM with or without perforation. CONCLUSION: This study confirms a positive association between nasopharyngeal bacterial load and clinical ear state, exacerbated by respiratory viruses, in Indigenous children.

Summary Introduction Heroin use can be responsible for many respiratory complications including asthma. Objectives Systematic literature review of data on asthma in heroin users. Documentary sources Medline\u00AE, on the period 1980-2017 with the following keywords: keywords: \u201Casthma\u201D or \u201Cbronchospasm\u201D and \u201Cheroin\u201D or \u201Copiate\u201D or \u201Copiates\u201D, limits \u201Ctitle/abstract\u201D; the selected languages were English or French. Among 97 articles, 67 abstracts have given use to a dual reading to select 23 studies. Results The seven case reports included 21 patients (mean age: 28 years [19\u201346 years]; sex-ratio: 2.5 [males: 71.5%]). Heroin was inhaled (71.4%), sniffed (19%) or injected by intravenous route (9.5%). Associated addictive substances were tobacco (81%), cannabis (38%), alcohol (4.7%) and cocaine (4.7%). Outcome was fatal in 3 subjects (14.3%). Other studies included one cross-sectional study, 3 case-control studies and 12 longitudinal studies (11 retrospective studies and one prospective study). The proportion of heroin users was higher in asthmatic subjects and the prevalence of asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity was higher in heroin users. Heroin use can be responsible for asthma onset, with a temporal relationship between the onset of heroin use and asthma onset in 28 to 31% of subjects. A positive association between inhaled heroin use and acute asthma exacerbation was observed. Asthma treatment observance was lower in heroin users. In case of asthma exacerbation, heroin users were more likely to seek care in the emergency department, to be admitted in intensive care units and to require intubation and invasive ventilation. Asthma deaths related to heroin use mainly occurred following an intravenous injection (especially in the case of overdose), but also following heroin use by nasal (sniff) or pulmonary route. Conclusion Heroin use may be responsible for asthma onset, acute asthma exacerbations (which may require intubation and invasive ventilation) or deaths related to asthma. Heroin use must be sought in case of asthma exacerbation in young persons and practitioners must help heroin users to stop their consumption.","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Underner, Michel; Perriot, Jean; Peiffer, G\u00E9rard; Jaafari, Nematollah","journal":"La Presse M\u00E9dicale","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b3fbee1773dcb5f498a53bfd788e69eaef84a3cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126345.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0755498217303019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0755498217303019","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs2OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Asthma"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["h\u00E9ro\u00EFne inhal\u00E9e","asthme provoqu\u00E9s","asthma in heroin users","The proportion","Heroin was inhaled","consommation","the prevalence","the period","proportion de consommateurs","Summary Introduction Heroin","\u00E9tudes cas-t\u00E9moins","heroin users was higher in asthmatic subjects","bronchial hyperreactivity was higher in heroin users","control studies","longitudinal studies","retrospective studies","\u00E9tudes longitudinales","\u00E9tudes r\u00E9trospectives","Other studies included","with the following keywords","Outcome was fatal in","rapports de cas","cas de surdose","sujets asthmatiques","sujets jeunes","the selected languages were English or French","Results The seven case reports included","patients","many respiratory complications including asthma","Title","prospective study","years","\u00E9tude prospective","ventilation invasive","voie intraveineuse","d\u00E9c\u00E8s","d\u00E9veloppement","articles","opiates","sex","ratio","bronchospasm","cannabis","Sources documentaires Medline","Documentary sources Medline","sectional study","complications pulmonaires","\u00E9tude transversale","R\u00E9sum\u00E9 Introduction","voie nasale","injection intraveineuse","Associated addictive substances were tobacco","substances addictives associ\u00E9es","dual reading to select","can be responsible","given","cross","mean age","abstracts","Objectives Systematic literature review","lieu","langues retenues","recours","p\u00E9riode","litt\u00E9rature","\u00E2ge moyen","figure","d\u00E9but","praticiens","donn\u00E9es","r\u00E9sum\u00E9s s\u00E9lectionn\u00E9s","double lecture","relation temporelle","hyperr\u00E9activit\u00E9 bronchique","association positive","injected","soins intensifs","anglais","tabac","limites","limits","utilisation","pr\u00E9valence","intubation","usagers","exacerbations aigu\u00EBs","apparition","mots-cl\u00E9s","observance du traitement","intravenous route","urgences","sniffed","fran\u00E7ais","Objectifs","alcohol","Among","\u00E9volution","R\u00E9sultats","services","Conclusion","cocaine","hommes","alcool","coca\u00EFne","asthma onset in","Asthma deaths related to heroin","Conclusion Heroin","deaths related to asthma","asthma exacerbation in young persons","Asthma treatment observance was lower in heroin users","acute asthma exacerbations","practitioners must help heroin users to","especially in the case","to require intubation","must be sought in case","acute asthma exacerbation was observed","but also following heroin","to be admitted in intensive care units","association between inhaled heroin","heroin users were more likely to seek care in the emergency department","may be responsible","temporal relationship between the onset","invasive ventilation","which may require intubation","mainly occurred following an intravenous injection","with","overdose","their consumption","pulmonary route","subjects"],"language":"fr"},

Within the context of LARS, 186 parents of risk children completed a questionnaire on the respiratory symptoms of their children and the redecoration of their apartment at the end of the first and second year of life. A total 22% of the children suffered from obstructive bronchitis once or more during their first year, and 11% experienced this condition during their second year of life. Redecoration of the apartment had a significant influence on the appearance of obstructive bronchitis in the first (OR 4.1 95%CI 1.4 \u2013 11.9) and in the second year of life (OR 4.2 95%CI 1.4 \u2013 12.9). (The OR are adjusted for cord blood-IgE \u003E0.9 kU/l, birth weight \u22642500 g, male sex and double positive parental atopy anamnesis, dampness, smoking or pet in the apartment). Simultaneous contamination from redecoration activities and additional exposures such as smoking, a pet or dampness in the apartment increased the risk for obstructive bronchitis in the first year (OR 9.1; 95% CI 2.3 \u2013 34.8) as well as in the second year (OR 5.1; 95%CI 1.6 \u2013 15.6). Our data suggest that redecoration of the apartment is associated with the development of acute inflammations, but not with a chronic influence on the airways in atopy risk infants. At an exposure to more than one environmental factor, pronounced effects were seen.","publish_time":"2003-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diez, Ulrike; Rehwagen, Martina; Rolle-Kampczyk, Ulrike; Wetzig, Heide; Schulz, Rita; Richter, Matthias; Lehmann, Irina; Borte, Michael; Herbarth, Olf","journal":"International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1dbb25436e00927345bf7df5abba0f738052be1a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463904702072; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463904702072","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Leipzig Allergy Risk Children Study"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["apartment","year of life","influence of redecoration","years of life children","CI","parents of risk children","atopy risk infants","redecoration activities","Leipzig Allergy Risk Children Study","appearance of obstructive bronchitis","airway symptoms","birth cohort study","obstructive airway diseases","double positive family atopy anamnesis","double positive parental atopy anamnesis","cord blood IgE","cord blood-IgE","kU","dampness","significant influence","asthma symptoms","respiratory symptoms","chronic influence","low birth weight","pet","smoking","context of LARS","following inclusion criteria","male sex","indoor paint","authors","chemical emissions","additional exposures","questionnaire","airways","Simultaneous contamination","environmental factor","end","development of acute inflammations","Abstract Findings","effects","adults","condition","data","aim"],"language":"en"},

Grossly, there were patchy or diffuse areas of endocardial thickening affecting the left ventricle. The more common patchy endocardial lesions occurred as large trabecular or irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue bridging the left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum. Microscopically, regardless of the gross pattern, the thickened endocardium contained various numbers of stellate, spindle-shaped or elongated mesenchymal cells surrounded by fibrous connective tissue. Immunohistochemical findings were indicative of smooth muscle differentiation in mesenchymal cells. These cells proliferated vigorously and produced alcian blue-positive ground substance and collagen fibres; it was considered that the mesenchymal cells contributed to the formation of the endocardial lesions. In addition, multiple left ventricular \u2018false tendons\u2019 were invariably included within the trabecular or broad fibrous bands, providing a framework for formation of those bands. Evidence of endocarditis or endomyocarditis was lacking in all 41 cases, and no viral genomes were detected in any of the DNA or RNA samples obtained from 14 of the hearts. These observations suggest that any relationship between feline RCM and a virus-induced inflammatory response seems unlikely.","publish_time":"2016-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kimura, Y.; Karakama, S.; Hirakawa, A.; Tsuchiaka, S.; Kobayashi, M.; Machida, N.","journal":"Journal of Comparative Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80d115e9b6fee959590a61f3aafe10ad20574172.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094507.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021997516300585; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021997516300585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27392420/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2016.06.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RCM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["broad fibrous bands","elongated mesenchymal cells","irregular broad bands of fibrous tissue","left ventricular free wall","fibrous connective tissue","ventricular septum","left ventricle","feline RCM","common patchy endocardial lesions","formation","cases of feline restrictive cardiomyopathy","diffuse areas of endocardial thickening","produced alcian blue-positive ground substance","indicative of smooth muscle differentiation","spindle-shaped","various numbers of stellate","thickened endocardium","virus","molecular features","false tendons\u2019","framework","collagen fibres","Immunohistochemical findings","study","relationship","addition","gross pattern","inflammatory response","Summary","endomyocarditis","RNA samples","DNA","Evidence of endocarditis","viral genomes","observations","hearts"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about laboratory prognostic markers in COVID-19 patients. The aim of our study was to describe the basic clotting parameters in COVID-19 patients and their prognostic role in different clinical forms of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Emergency Department. A cohort of 67 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory illness was used as a control group. For all patients, platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (aPTT), C-reactive protein (PCR), fibrinogen, and D-dimer were determined. The COVID-19 population was divided in two groups according to the presence or absence of SARS. The clotting factors values were compared between the groups. RESULTS At admission, the COVID-19 patients showed statistically significant increased levels of fibrinogen (601.5 (480-747) vs. 455 (352.5-588.5) mg/dL; p = 0.0000064), and a higher percentage of patients had fibrinogen levels \u003E400 mg/dL (86% vs.58%; p = 0.0054) compared to the control group. The levels of fibrinogen were higher in COVID-19 patients with SARS compared to those without SARS (747 (600.0-834.0) vs. 567 (472.5-644.50); p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION Fibrinogen seems to increase early in COVID-19 patients and may be used as a risk stratification marker for the early detection of a subgroup of COVID-19 patient at increased risk to develop SARS, who might benefit from a different and thorough clinical surveillance and treatment.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Micco, Pierpaolo; Russo, Vincenzo; Carannante, Novella; Imparato, Michele; Rodolfi, Stefano; Cardillo, Giuseppe; Lodigiani, Corrado","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32392741/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051371","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs3Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["subgroup of COVID","higher percentage of patients","fibrinogen levels","sex-matched non-COVID","CONCLUSION Fibrinogen","absence of SARS","significant increased levels of fibrinogen","coronavirus disease","increased risk","groups","control group","acute respiratory illness","different clinical forms","severe acute respiratory syndrome","prognostic role","prothrombin time","thromboplastin time","early detection","thorough clinical surveillance","laboratory prognostic markers","risk stratification marker","basic clotting parameters","clotting factors values","pathogenic human coronavirus able","PLT","C-reactive protein","aPTT","novel","PCR","platelet count","INTRODUCTION","treatment","study","presence","admission","D-dimer","cohort","cause","Emergency Department","MATERIAL","METHODS","RESULTS","population","China","countries","aim","outbreak"],"language":"en"},

Despite advances in asthma management, acute exacerbations continue to be a major problem in patients and they result in a considerable burden on direct/indirect health care providers. A severe exacerbation occurring within 1 year is an independent risk factor. Respiratory tract viruses have emerged as the most frequent triggers of exacerbations in children. It is becoming increasingly clear that interactions may exist between viruses and other triggers, increasing the likelihood of an exacerbation. In this study, we provide an overview of current knowledge about asthma exacerbations, including its definition, impact on health care providers, and associated factors. Prevention management in intermittent asthma as well as intermittent wheeze in pre-school children and those with persistent asthma are discussed. Our review findings support the importance of controlling persistent asthma, as indicated in current guidelines. In addition, we found that early episodic intervention appeared to be crucial in preventing severe attacks and future exacerbations. Besides the use of medication, timely education after an exacerbation along with a comprehensive plan in follow up is also vitally important.","publish_time":"2013-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fu, Lin-Shien; Tsai, Ming-Chin","journal":"Pediatr Neonatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db2c54ab3f36dd546460c0e72aefdc17abf5355c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102856.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875957213001368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24211086/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedneo.2013.07.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1875957213001368","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma exacerbations","intermittent asthma","persistent asthma","asthma management","acute exacerbations","future exacerbations","severe exacerbation","frequent triggers of exacerbations","Respiratory tract viruses","indirect health care providers","intermittent wheeze","pre-school children","severe attacks","Prevention management","current guidelines","common chronic lower respiratory tract disease","overview of current knowledge","childhood","definition","considerable burden","year","impact","timely education","associated factors","importance","advances","early episodic intervention","use of medication","major problem","independent risk factor","patients","world","review findings","addition","interactions","comprehensive plan","likelihood","study"],"language":"en"},

The present study aims to analyze the miRNAs related to pathogenicity of nephropathogenic IBVs. It was found that four miRNAs (miR-1454, miR-3538, miR-146a-5p and miR-215-5p) were related to the infection of virulent nephropathogenic IBV with transcript per million (TPM) \u003E 500 and more than a 2-fold alteration. In vitro study results showed that the alterations of these four miRNAs were consistent with in vivo data. In vitro, we found that high levels of miR-146a-5p could enhance the replication of IBV at the early stage of infection, and its down regulated level could slow down the replication of IBV. Finally, high levels of exogenous miR-146a-5p in HD11 cells led to down regulation of IL-1 receptor associated kinase-2 (IRAK2) and Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 18 (TNFRSF18) genes. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-146a-5p could bind to the 3\u2032-UTRs of IRAK2 and TNFRSF18. This is the first study demonstrating that IBV induced miR-146a-5p is related to virus pathogenesis by down regulating IRAK2 and TNFRSF18, which may serve as a therapeutic strategy for the prevention of IBV infections.","publish_time":"2018-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Hui; Yang, Xin; Zhang, Zhi-kun; Zou, Wen-cheng; Wang, Hong-ning","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dd5ffacaf860a7b441e4bd4496b4b1c02fda278d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126895.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088240101830161X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088240101830161X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29702211/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2018.04.046","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IBV induced miR","replication of IBV","high levels of miR","high levels of exogenous miR","miRNAs","TNFRSF18","infection of virulent nephropathogenic IBV","prevention of IBV infections","Gallus gallus","UTRs of IRAK2","study results","present study","virus pathogenesis","early stage of infection","pathogenicity of nephropathogenic IBVs","Avian infectious bronchitis virus","Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member","significant economic losses","ages","transcript","coronavirus","poultry industry","regulation of IL","alterations","therapeutic strategy","HD11 cells","regulated level","chickens","Luciferase reporter assays","kinase","data","TPM","fold alteration"],"language":"en"},

The principal objective is to undertake a multicenter incident case\u2013control study of \u003C5-year-old children hospitalized with pneumonia in developing and emerging countries, aiming to identify the causative agents involved in pneumonia while assessing individual and microbial factors associated with the risk of severe pneumonia. METHODS/DESIGN: A multicenter case\u2013control study, based on the GABRIEL network, is ongoing. Ten study sites are located in 9 countries over 3 continents: Brazil, Cambodia, China, Haiti, India, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, and Paraguay. At least 1,000 incident cases and 1,000 controls will be enrolled and matched for age and date. Cases are hospitalized children \u003C5 years with radiologically confirmed pneumonia, and the controls are children without any features suggestive of pneumonia. Respiratory specimens are collected from all enrolled subjects to identify 19 viruses and 5 bacteria. Whole blood from pneumonia cases is being tested for 3 major bacteria. S. pneumoniae-positive specimens are serotyped. Urine samples from cases only are tested for detection of antimicrobial activity. The association between procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and pathogens is being evaluated. A discovery platform will enable pathogen identification in undiagnosed samples. DISCUSSION: This multicenter study will provide descriptive results for better understanding of pathogens responsible for pneumonia among children in developing countries. The identification of determinants related to microorganisms associated with pneumonia and its severity should facilitate treatment and prevention.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV briefly emerged into the human population but was controlled. In 2012, another novel severely human pathogenic CoV\u2014the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV\u2014was identified in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; 80% of over 2000 human cases have been recorded over five years.

Travel-related cases continue to challenge the world\u2019s surveillance and response capabilities, and more data are needed to understand unexplained primary transmission. Signs of genetic change have been recorded, but it remains unclear whether there is any impact on clinical disease. How camels came to carry the virus remains academic to the control of MERS.

MERS-CoV is not currently a pandemic threat; it is spread mainly with the aid of human habit and error.","publish_time":"2017-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mackay, Ian M.; Arden, Katherine E.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32da24606ad160166f08cf05349eaadd580ccff0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5744144.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v9120369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29207494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MERS"],"locations":["Middle East","Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV","human pathogenic CoV","human cases","human transmission","human coronaviruses","human population","control of MERS","aid of human habit","HCoV-NL63","HCoV-OC43","HCoV-HKU1","virus surveillance","CoVs cause disease","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome","control strategies","world\u2019s surveillance","response capabilities","clinical disease","future change","cause of mild illness","unexplained primary transmission","Travel-related cases","Signs of genetic change","characterisation","SARS","data","reporting","camel reservoir","Targeted research","new therapeutic toolbox","impact","error","novel","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","pandemic threat","date","years","camels","decades"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: 75% of the ECPs planned on wearing masks during refractions and 69% when fitting contact lens. 62% of the ECPs also expected their patients to wear masks in these tasks. This number is higher than for distance tasks such as fitting frames. Around 90% of the ECPs would, in addition to hand washing, disinfect their hands and around 80% expected their patients to do so too.

This mechanism has been recognized as a critical mediator of influenza-induced lung disease, and it could be pivotal for COVID-19 infections. Thus, an immunomodulatory approach targeting the over-production of cytokines could be proposed for viral aggressive pulmonary disease treatment. In this regard, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03B3, a member of the PPAR transcription factor family, could represent a potential target. Beside the well-known regulatory role on lipid and glucose metabolism, PPAR-\u03B3 also represses the inflammatory process. Similarly, the PPAR-\u03B3 agonist thiazolidinediones (TZDs), like pioglitazone, are anti-inflammatory drugs with ameliorating effects on severe viral pneumonia. In addition to the pharmacological agonists, also nutritional ligands of PPAR-\u03B3, like curcuma, lemongrass, and pomegranate, possess anti-inflammatory properties through PPAR-\u03B3 activation. Here, we review the main synthetic and nutritional PPAR-\u03B3 ligands, proposing a dual approach based on the strengthening of the immune system using pharmacological and dietary strategies as an attempt to prevent/treat cytokine storm in the case of coronavirus infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ciavarella, Carmen; Motta, Ilenia; Valente, Sabrina; Pasquinelli, Gianandrea","journal":"Molecules","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25092076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365556/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPAR-\u03B3 activation","nutritional PPAR-\u03B3 ligands","PPAR-\u03B3 agonist thiazolidinediones","nutritional ligands of PPAR","PPAR transcription factor family","over-production of cytokines","over-activation","cytokine storm","abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines","anti-inflammatory drugs","anti-inflammatory properties","pharmacological agonists","immune system","dual approach","immunomodulatory approach","inflammatory process","viral aggressive pulmonary disease treatment","severe viral pneumonia","induced lung disease","innate immune response","ameliorating effects","glucose metabolism","lipid","member","peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","critical mediator of influenza","pioglitazone","dietary strategies","attempt","strengthening","pomegranate","TZDs","well-known regulatory role","main synthetic","lemongrass","curcuma","case of coronavirus infection","regard","potential target","COVID","infections","addition","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, it is essential to study the codon usage of the E2 gene of the CSFV. In this study, 140 coding sequences of the E2 gene were analyzed. The value of effective number of codons (ENC) showed low codon usage bias in the E2 gene. Our study showed that codon usage could be described mainly by mutation pressure ENC plot analysis combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and translational selection-correlation analysis between the general average hydropathicity (Gravy) and aromaticity (Aroma), and nucleotides at the third position of codons (A3s, T3s, G3s, C3s and GC3s). Furthermore, the neutrality analysis, which explained the relationship between GC12s and GC3s, revealed that natural selection had a key role compared with mutational bias during the evolution of the E2 gene.

We seek to communicate the current guidelines published by each state, to discuss the impact of these guidelines on orthopaedic surgery, and to provide the general framework used to determine which procedures have been postponed at our institution. METHODS: An internet search was used to identify published state guidelines regarding the cancellation of elective procedures, with a publication cutoff of March 24, 2020, 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Data collected included the number of states providing guidance to cancel elective procedures and which states provided specific guidance in determining which procedures should continue being performed as well as to orthopaedic-specific guidance. RESULTS: Thirty states published guidance regarding the discontinuation of elective procedures, and 16 states provided a definition of \u201Celective\u201D procedures or specific guidance for determining which procedures should continue to be performed. Only 5 states provided guidelines specifically mentioning orthopaedic surgery; of those, 4 states explicitly allowed for trauma-related procedures and 4 states provided guidance against performing arthroplasty. Ten states provided guidelines allowing for the continuation of oncological procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Few states have published guidelines specific to orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving hospital systems and surgeons with the responsibility of balancing the benefits of surgery with the risks to public health.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sarac, Nikolas J.; Sarac, Benjamin A.; Schoenbrunner, Anna R.; Janis, Jeffrey E.; Harrison, Ryan K.; Phieffer, Laura S.; Quatman, Carmen E.; Ly, Thuan V.","journal":"J Bone Joint Surg Am","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5340f592811d2027957923152bc359589ffa436b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197340.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32282419/; https://doi.org/10.2106/jbjs.20.00510","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Eastern Daylight Time"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cancellation of elective procedures","discontinuation of elective procedures","orthopaedic-specific guidance","guidelines specific","number of states","widespread cancellation of elective orthopaedic procedures","orthopaedic surgery","trauma-related procedures","continuation of oncological procedures","published state guidelines","current guidelines","benefits of surgery","COVID","responsibility","outbreak","hospital systems","surgeons","risks","impact","internet search","SARS-CoV","public health","pandemic","multiple sources","publication cutoff","definition","general framework","Eastern Daylight Time","BACKGROUND","METHODS","Data","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","arthroplasty","standards","institution"],"language":"en"},

Relatively few whole genome sequences are available for both HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 viruses, so our study sought to provide whole genome sequences from multiple countries to further the understanding of the global diversity of HPIV at a whole-genome level. We collected HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 samples and isolates from Argentina, Australia, France, Mexico, South Africa, Switzerland, and USA from the years 2003\u20132011 and sequenced the genomes of 40 HPIV-1 and 75 HPIV-3 viruses with Sanger and next-generation sequencing with the Ion Torrent, Illumina, and 454 platforms. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HPIV-1 genome is evolving at an estimated rate of 4.97 \u00D7 10(\u22124) mutations/site/year (95% highest posterior density 4.55 \u00D7 10(\u22124) to 5.38 \u00D7 10(\u22124)) and the HPIV-3 genome is evolving at a similar rate (3.59 \u00D7 10(\u22124) mutations/site/year, 95% highest posterior density 3.26 \u00D7 10(\u22124) to 3.94 \u00D7 10(\u22124)).

(2013) The impact of bacterial and viral co\u2010infection in severe influenza. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 7(2) 168\u2013176. Background Many questions remain concerning the burden, risk factors and impact of bacterial and viral co\u2010infection in patients with pandemic influenza admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Objectives To examine the burden, risk factors and impact of bacterial and viral co\u2010infection in Australian patients with severe influenza. Patients/Methods A cohort study conducted in 14 ICUs was performed. Patients with proven influenza A during the 2009 influenza season were eligible for inclusion. Demographics, risk factors, clinical data, microbiological data, complications and outcomes were collected. Polymerase chain reaction for additional bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens was performed on stored respiratory samples. Results Co\u2010infection was identified in 23\u00B73\u201326\u00B79% of patients with severe influenza A infection: viral co\u2010infection, 3\u00B72\u20133\u00B74% and bacterial co\u2010infection, 20\u00B75\u201324\u00B77%. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent bacterial co\u2010infection followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Patients with co\u2010infection were younger [mean difference in age = 8\u00B746 years (95% CI: 0\u00B718\u201316\u00B774 years)], less likely to have significant co\u2010morbidities (32\u00B70% versus 66\u00B72%, P = 0\u00B7004) and less frequently obese [mean difference in body mass index = 6\u00B786 (95% CI: 1\u00B777\u201311\u00B796)] compared to those without co\u2010infection. Conclusions Bacterial or viral co\u2010infection complicated one in four patients admitted to ICU with severe influenza A infection. Despite the co\u2010infected patients being younger and with fewer co\u2010morbidities, no significant difference in outcomes was observed. It is likely that co\u2010infection contributed to a need for ICU admission in those without other risk factors for severe influenza disease. Empiric antibiotics with staphylococcal activity should be strongly considered in all patients with severe influenza A infection.","publish_time":"2012-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Blyth, Christopher C.; Webb, Steve A.

There is a need to identify key pathogenic molecules in COVID-19-associated inflammation attainable to target with existing therapeutic compounds. The endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule HMGB1 initiates inflammation via two separate pathways. Disulfide-HMGB1 triggers TLR4 receptors generating pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Extracellular HMGB1, released from dying cells or secreted by activated innate immunity cells, forms complexes with extracellular DNA, RNA and other DAMP or pathogen-associated molecular (DAMP) molecules released after lytic cell death. These complexes are endocytosed via RAGE, constitutively expressed at high levels in the lungs only, and transported to the endolysosomal system, which is disrupted by HMGB1 at high concentrations. Danger molecules thus get access to cytosolic proinflammatory receptors instigating inflammasome activation. It is conceivable that extracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA may reach the cellular cytosol via HMGB1-assisted transfer combined with lysosome leakage. Extracellular HMGB1 generally exists in vivo bound to other molecules, including PAMPs and DAMPs. It is plausible that these complexes are specifically removed in the lungs revealed by a 40% reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels in arterial versus venous blood. Abundant pulmonary RAGE expression enables endocytosis of danger molecules to be destroyed in the lysosomes at physiological HMGB1 levels, but causing detrimental inflammasome activation at high levels. Stress induces apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial cells from females but necrosis in cells from males. CONCLUSION: Based on these observations we propose extracellular HMGB1 to be considered as a therapeutic target for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andersson, Ulf; Ottestad, William; Tracey, Kevin J.","journal":"Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f56a0a96e078af59e7e5ada5ebac1053a20e8f8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7203545.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s10020-020-00172-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380958/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsxNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAGE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Extracellular HMGB1","physiological HMGB1 levels","reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels","high levels","molecule HMGB1 initiates inflammation","COVID","extracellular DNA","Disulfide-HMGB1 triggers TLR4 receptors","endocytosis of danger molecules","pulmonary endothelial cells","key pathogenic molecules","extracellular SARS-CoV","innate immunity cells","RNA","forms complexes","associated inflammation attainable","high concentrations","therapeutic target","lungs","detrimental inflammasome activation","molecular pattern","Abundant pulmonary RAGE expression","cytosolic proinflammatory receptors","existing therapeutic compounds","females","unresolved reasons acute respiratory distress syndrome","pro-inflammatory cytokine release","arterial","necrosis","access","vulnerable individuals","transfer","apoptosis","venous blood","separate pathways","novel coronavirus disease","cellular cytosol","lysosomes","lytic cell death","endogenous damage","BACKGROUND","need","observations","lysosome leakage","PAMPs","DAMPs","endolysosomal system","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Using methodology based on the Delphi technique, six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement and consensus view on issues pertinent to the aim. RESULTS: Key themes emerged where evidence shows that interaction with microbes that inhabit the natural environment and human microbiome plays an essential role in immune regulation. Changes in lifestyle and environmental exposure, rapid urbanisation, altered diet and antibiotic use have had profound effects on the human microbiome, leading to failure of immunotolerance and increased risk of allergic disease. Although evidence supports the concept of immune regulation driven by microbe\u2013host interactions, the term \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019 is a misleading misnomer. There is no good evidence that hygiene, as the public understands, is responsible for the clinically relevant changes to microbial exposures. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests a combination of strategies, including natural childbirth, breast feeding, increased social exposure through sport, other outdoor activities, less time spent indoors, diet and appropriate antibiotic use, may help restore the microbiome and perhaps reduce risks of allergic disease. Preventive efforts must focus on early life. The term \u2018hygiene hypothesis\u2019 must be abandoned. Promotion of a risk assessment approach (targeted hygiene) provides a framework for maximising protection against pathogen exposure while allowing spread of essential microbes between family members.

METHODS: We examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death at a large medical center in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with Covid-19, excluding those who were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department (study baseline). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1446 consecutive patients, 70 patients were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1376 patients, during a median follow-up of 22.5 days, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine (600 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg daily for a median of 5 days); 45.8% of the patients were treated within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department, and 85.9% within 48 hours. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, 223 vs. 360). Overall, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180 patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently died, and 166 died without intubation). In the main analysis, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.32). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (and its species). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 110 healthy, non-hospitalized infants without acute illness at an academic medical center from November 2013 through May 2014. We tested nasal swab specimens by using polymerase chain reaction and genetic sequencing. RESULTS: Overall, the median age was 3.8 months (IQR 2.0\u20135.1 months), 56 % were male, and 90 % were born \u003E37 weeks. RSV was detected in nasal swabs from infants (1.8 %). By contrast, rhinovirus was detected in nasal swabs from 16 infants (14.5 %). Molecular typing assay revealed rhinovirus species: six rhinovirus-A (5.5 %), one rhinovirus-B (0.9 %), eight rhinovirus-C (7.3 %), and one untypeable (0.9 %). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of healthy, community-based infants, RSV was rare (\u003C2 %) in nasal swabs, while rhinovirus was detected in 14.5 % with a predominance of rhinovirus-A and -C.

Nevertheless, systematic studies on the association between these viruses and mood disorders are lacking. METHODS: Influenza A, B and coronavirus antibody titers were measured in 257 subjects with recurrent unipolar and bipolar disorder and healthy controls, by SCID. Pearson\u2019s \u03C7(2) tests and logistic regression models were used to analyze associations between seropositivity for coronaviruses, influenza A and B viruses and the following: a) history of recurrent mood disorders b) having attempted suicide in the past c) uni- vs. bi-polarity and d) presence of psychotic features during mood episodes. RESULTS: Seropositivity for influenza A (p=0.004), B (p\u003C0.0001) and coronaviruses (p\u003C0.0001) were associated with history of mood disorders but not with the specific diagnosis of unipolar or bipolar depression.

Although subsequent genomic sequence analysis revealed that the Yichang virus had similar protein patterns as those of other mesoniviruses, the nucleotide acids shared less than 20% BLAST query coverage with known viruses in the family Mesoniviridae, and showed a maximum sequence identity of 67% for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The putative protein sequences showed slightly higher identity (28%\u201368%), and the most conserved domain was RdRp. Based on the phylogenetic and pairwise evolutionary distance analyses, the Yichang virus should be considered a new species belonging to a currently unassigned genus within the family Mesoniviridae.","publish_time":"2017-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yujuan; Xia, Han; Zhang, Bo; Liu, Xiaoyun; Yuan, Zhiming","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42583c0e7a90b3b8a9145c57e5378076978e830a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125798.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28823942/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217304665; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2017.08.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217304665","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Yichang virus","family Mesoniviridae","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RdRp","maximum sequence identity","high number of viral RNA copies","new species","higher identity","multiplicity of infection","mammalian cells","similar protein patterns","putative protein sequences","new insect nidovirus","d post-infection","subsequent genomic sequence analysis","nm","known viruses","PFU","diameters","evolutionary distance analyses","BLAST query coverage","moderate cytopathic effects","unassigned genus","maximal levels","spherical particles","large club-shaped projections","mesoniviruses","virion","titers","Culex mosquitoes","Hubei","China","Results","nucleotide acids","electron microscopy","C6","conserved domain","addition"],"language":"en"},

The Mann\u2013Kendall and Pettitt methods were used to identify the temporal trends and abrupt changes in the time series of daily new confirmed cases, respectively. The local Moran\u2019s I index was applied to uncover the spatial patterns of the incidence rate, including spatial clusters and outliers. On the basis of the data from January 26 to February 11, 2020, we found that there were 11 areas with different types of temporal patterns of daily new confirmed cases. The pattern characterized by an increasing trend and abrupt change is mainly attributed to the improvement in the ability to diagnose the disease. Spatial clusters with high incidence rates during the period were concentrated in Wuhan Metropolitan Area due to the high intensity of spatial interaction of the population. Therefore, enhancing the ability to diagnose the disease and controlling the movement of the population can be confirmed as effective measures to prevent and control the regional outbreak of the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Wentao; Deng, Min; Li, Chaokui; Huang, Jincai","journal":"Int J Environ Res Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e1dd6e84f1c9d85dad91a3475f8c5cc35558428.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7177341.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32276501/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072563","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Moran"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hubei","Wuhan Metropolitan Area"],"keyphrases":["spatial patterns","spatio-temporal patterns","temporal trends","temporal dynamics","spatial clusters","nCoV epidemic","spatio-temporal characteristics","spatio-temporal analysis methods","spatial dependency","different types of temporal patterns of daily new confirmed cases","high intensity of spatial interaction","population","research","ability","disease","time series of daily new confirmed cases","high incidence rates","abrupt changes","Pettitt methods","period","county level","Wuhan Metropolitan Area","increasing trend","areas","novel coronavirus","Hubei province","local Moran\u2019s I index","Mann","Kendall","outliers","effective measures","regional outbreak","improvement","movement","basis","data"],"language":"en"},

A combination of as yet poorly understood host and viral factors combine to cause a minority of FCoV-infected cats to develop FIP. Clinicopathological features include fever, vasculitis, and serositis, with or without effusions; all of which indicate a pro-inflammatory state with cytokine release. As a result, primary immune organs, as well as circulating leukocytes, have thus far been of most interest in previous studies to determine the likely sources of these cytokines. Results have suggested that these tissues alone may not be sufficient to induce the observed inflammation. The current study therefore focussed on the liver and heart, organs with a demonstrated ability to produce cytokines and therefore with huge potential to exacerbate inflammatory processes. The IL-12:IL-10 ratio, a marker of the immune system\u2019s inflammatory balance, was skewed towards the pro-inflammatory IL-12 in the liver of cats with FIP. Both organs were found to upregulate mRNA expression of the inflammatory triad of cytokines IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03B1 in FIP.

The part-worth values for the trip product elements are expected to depend on a number of traveler characteristics. The predictors hypothesized are city travel experience, general modal preference, socio-economic status, and car ownership. In the survey, the combinations of trip attributes differed between the two subgroups of leisure and business travelers. The leisure travelers rated three levels of mode, length of stay, and price, but only one level of the hotel category. The business travelers were shown four mode alternatives and only two levels for each of the other trip product elements. The conjoint measurements were elaborated by fitting an Extended Bradley\u2013Terry Model. Demonstrating the application of the EBTM is the main purpose of the paper. The EBTM offers several advantages over the more popular versions of conjoint analysis. It correctly treats ties and allows for simultaneous estimation of the trip package (\u2018object\u2019) parameters, object covariates (trip attributes), subject covariates (traveler characteristics) and their interactions. For both the business and the leisure travelers, the mode of transport dominated the assessment of a city trip package. For leisure tourists, e.g., switching from train 2nd class to an economy flight boosted the trip package more than twice as much as replacing train for bus. A variation of the package price was much more important for the leisure than for the business travelers. The socio-economic status proved to be an important factor and was particularly influential among the business travelers. In the leisure tourists\u0027 sub-sample age was not only important for valuing the mode of transport, but had a preferential impact for all trip components. Finally, the limitations of this demonstration study that discourage extrapolation to city travelers in general are emphasized.","publish_time":"2007-06-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hatzinger, Reinhold; Mazanec, Josef A.","journal":"J Bus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5abd7ebfa196f438b64489a66c3a4856aa26d5da.json; document_parses/pdf_json/eabb51d9cc4d09b9bb231c404d4fe55aaddab881.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124329.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296307001257; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.04.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0148296307001257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBTM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["leisure travelers","business travelers","city trip package","city travelers","trip components","packaged city trip","trip product elements","combinations of trip attributes","mode of transport","subgroups of leisure","levels of mode","package price","mode alternatives","city travel experience","object covariates","socio-economic status","important factor","leisure tourists\u0027 sub-sample age","train","EBTM","modes of transport air","number of traveler characteristics","subject covariates","demonstration study","conjoint measurements","general modal preference","popular versions of conjoint analysis","parameters","rail","economy flight","extrapolation","assessment","utility","travelers\u0027 perceived change","length of stay","preferential impact","simultaneous estimation","worth values","Extended Bradley","main purpose","car ownership","Terry Model","advantages","class","predictors","survey","hotel category","paper","ties","application","limitations","interactions","variation"],"language":"en"},

However, the search for an efficient vaccine is still ongoing. One of the main problems is the presence of a continuously evolving dense carbohydrate shield, consisting of N\u2010linked glycans that surrounds the virion and protects it against efficient recognition and persistent neutralization by the immune system. However, several lectins from the innate immune system specifically bind to these glycans in an attempt to process the virus antigens to provoke an immune response. Across a wide variety of different species in nature lectins can be found that can interact with the glycosylated envelope of HIV\u20101 and can block the infection of susceptible cells by the virus.

The dynamic data indicate that the pandemic by CoV-19 so far has infected 2,403,963 individuals, and among these 624,698 have recovered while, it has been fatal for 165,229. Without much experience, currently, the medicines that are clinically being evaluated for COVID-19 include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, lopinavir, ritonavir, tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Therefore, countries such as Italy, USA, Spain and France with the most advanced health care system are partially successful to control CoV-19 infection. India being the 2nd largest populous country, where, the healthcare system is underdeveloped, major portion of population follow unhygienic lifestyle, is able to restrict the rate of both infection and death of its citizens from COVID-19. India has followed an early and a very strict social distancing by lockdown and has issued advisory to clean hands regularly by soap and/or by alcohol based sterilizers. Rolling data on the global index of the CoV infection is 13,306, and the index of some countries such as USA (66,148), Italy (175,055), Spain (210,126), France (83,363) and Switzerland (262,122) is high. The index of India has remained very low (161) so far, mainly due to early implementation of social lockdown, social distancing, and sanitizing hands. However, articles on social lockdown as a preventive measure against COVID-19 in PubMed are scanty. It has been observed that social lockdown has also drastic impacts on the environment especially on reduction of NO2 and CO2 emission. Slow infection rate under strict social distancing will offer time to researchers to come up with exact medicines/vaccines against CoV-19. Therefore, it is concluded that stringent social distancing via lockdown is highly important to control COVID-19 and also to contribute for self-regeneration of nature.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paital, Biswaranjan; Das, Kabita; Parida, Sarat Kumar","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3984916b8f4c9a443981a291478c51596338446b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179495.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720324311; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720324311?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339832/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138914","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":["Spain","France","India"],"keyphrases":["CoV infection","COVID","strict social distancing","stringent social distancing","early implementation of social lockdown","Abstract Infection","index of India","countries","Slow infection rate","tocilizumab","France","pandemic","USA","global index","Spain","Italy","healthcare system","clean hands","Coronavirus Disease","sanitizing hands","exact medicines","dynamic data","advanced health care system","lopinavir","major portion of population","unhygienic lifestyle","azithromycin","ritonavir","hydroxychloroquine","advisory","researchers","preventive measure","reduction of NO2","drastic impacts","environment","soap","largest populous country","death","time","CO2 emission","corticosteroids","PubMed","vaccines","citizens","articles","self-regeneration of nature","alcohol","Switzerland","emergence","sterilizers","experience","individuals"],"language":"en"},

The aim was to determine if dual infections, as compared to single virus infections, result in enhanced clinical manifestations. It was also examined if PRRSV replication affects replication of PRCV or SIV in the respiratory tract. Groups of conventional 10 week old pigs were inoculated with PRRSV-only (3 pigs), PRCV-only (4 pigs) or SIV-only (4 pigs). Dual inoculations with PRRSV-PRCV (4 pigs) and PRRSV-SIV (3 groups of 4, 4 and 5 pigs) were performed at a 3 day interval. A group of uninoculated control pigs (8 pigs) was included. The infection with PRRSV-only induced a transient fever (40.2\u00B0C) at 2 DPI, but no respiratory signs. The PRCV-only infection remained subclinical. The SIV-only infection resulted in a one day fever (40.1\u00B0C) with moderate tachypnoea and dyspnoea. Mean weight gain in the virus-inoculated groups was retarded compared with the control group. The PRRSV-PRCV infection induced a 9 day lasting fever (peak 40.9\u00B0C) with tachypnoea, dyspnoea and productive coughing. The PRRSV-SIV infection resulted in fever and respiratory signs in all 3 groups. Clinical signs, however, were more pronounced in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. Pigs of group 1 showed fever during 10 days (peak 41.4\u00B0C), tachypnoea, marked dyspnoea with abdominal breathing, and a productive cough. Pigs of groups 2 and 3 had fever for 5 and 3 days (peaks 40.6 and 40.3\u00B0C) respectively and mild respiratory disorders. Mean weight gain during 14 DPI of the 2nd virus was 5.9 kg in the PRRSV-PRCV group and 4.0, 6.8 and 6.7 kg in PRRSV-SIV groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Mean weight gain during the corresponding period in the PRRSV-only group was 8.6 kg. It was concluded that dual infections with viruses causes more severe disease and growth retardation than single PRRSV infection. PRCV excretion curves were similar in single and dual virus inoculated groups. Excretion of SIV was delayed by 2 days in the dual inoculated pigs. Thus, replication of the second virus is not (PRCV) or only slightly (SIV) affected by a prior infection with PRRSV.","publish_time":"1996-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Reeth, Kristien; Nauwynck, Hans; Pensaert, Maurice","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c455cac4ef5d0fc056295a5b421e92b1489b693e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811359500145X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/037811359500145X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjszODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV","PRCV","SIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV-SIV groups","Pigs of groups","PRRSV-PRCV infection","PRRSV-SIV infection","PRRSV-PRCV group","PRRSV replication","single PRRSV infection","dual inoculated pigs","virus-inoculated groups","dual virus inoculated groups","replication of PRCV","Abstract Dual infections of pigs","Excretion of SIV","respiratory syndrome virus","common respiratory virus","group of uninoculated control pigs","single virus infections","respiratory signs","week old pigs","day fever","Groups of conventional","respiratory tract","PRCV excretion curves","prior infection","control group","Dual inoculations","transient fever","porcine respiratory coronavirus","swine influenza virus","day lasting fever","mild respiratory disorders","dyspnoea","Mean weight gain","days","Clinical signs","moderate tachypnoea","day interval","productive coughing","enhanced clinical manifestations","severe disease","growth retardation","corresponding period","abdominal breathing","viruses","peaks","aim"],"language":"en"},

In herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-infected cells, G4s are massively present during viral replication. We here aimed at investigating the possibility to target the HSV-1 G4s by a core extended naphtalene diimide (c-exNDI) G4 ligand. Biophysical and biomolecular analysis proved that c-exNDI stabilized the HSV-1 G4s in a concentration dependent manner. In MS competition assays, c-exNDI preferentially recognized HSV-1 G4s over cellular telomeric G4s, the most represented G4s within cells; other less abundant cellular G4s were also recognized. Treatment of HSV-1 infected cells with c-exNDI at low nanomolar concentrations induced significant virus inhibition with no cytotoxicity. The mechanism of action was ascribed to G4-mediated inhibition of viral DNA replication, with consequent impairment of viral genes transcription. Our data suggest that the observed potent antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity mainly depend on a combination of c-exNDI affinity for HSV-1 G4s and their massive presence during infection. HSV-1 G4s may thus represent new effective antiviral targets: the fact that no current antiherpetic drug exploits them and their presence at the viral genome, responsible for both active and latent HSV infections, makes them particularly attracting.","publish_time":"2017-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Callegaro, Sara; Perrone, Rosalba; Scalabrin, Matteo; Doria, Filippo; Pal\u00F9, Giorgio; Richter, Sara N.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56b2d409fd554bd2694eb7d938fd44fc282fd484.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5443766.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28539620/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-02667-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["represented G4s","c-exNDI","recognized HSV","Treatment of HSV","cellular telomeric G4s","abundant cellular G4s","latent HSV infections","exNDI affinity","combination of c","viral replication","infected cells","viral genome","low cytotoxicity","G4-mediated inhibition of viral DNA replication","significant virus inhibition","consequent impairment of viral genes transcription","massive presence","G4 ligand","low nanomolar concentrations","herpes simplex virus","observed potent antiviral activity","new effective antiviral targets","fact","epigenetic regulators","nucleic acids secondary structures","core extended naphtalene diimide","current antiherpetic drug exploits","MS competition assays","biomolecular analysis","concentration dependent manner","data","viruses","G-quadruplexes","mechanism of action","possibility"],"language":"en"},

Borna disease, caused by Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), is an infectious disease affecting mammals, but recently it has also been shown to cause fatal encephalitis in humans. The endemic character of Borna disease points towards a nature-bound reservoir, with only one shrew species identified as reservoir host to date. Bats have been identified as reservoirs of a variety of zoonotic infectious agents. Endogenous borna-like elements in the genome of certain bat species additionally point towards co-evolution of bats with bornaviruses and therefore raise the question whether bats could serve as a potential reservoir of orthobornaviruses. METHODS: Frozen brain samples (n = 257) of bats of seven different genera from Germany were investigated by orthobornaviral RT-PCR. Additionally, tissue slides of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material of a subset of these bats (n = 140) were investigated for orthobornaviral phosphoprotein by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The brain samples were tested by RT-PCR without any evidence of orthobornavirus specific amplicons. Immunohistochemistry revealed a faint immunoreaction in 3/140 bats but with an untypical staining pattern for viral antigen. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR-screening showed no evidence for orthobornaviral RNA in the investigated bats. However, immunohistochemistry results should be investigated further to elucidate whether the reaction might be associated with expressed endogenous bornaviral elements or other so far unknown bornaviruses.","publish_time":"2020-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nobach, Daniel; Herden, Christiane","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d166a765abf6acdbd7968281cee8e983e95d3277.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6993374.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32000801/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-1289-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Germany"],"keyphrases":["investigated bats","Borna disease virus","co-evolution of bats","orthobornaviral RT-PCR","immunohistochemistry results","endemic character of Borna disease points","nature-bound reservoir","reservoir host","orthobornaviral RNA","orthobornaviral phosphoprotein","variety of zoonotic infectious agents","Frozen brain samples","potential reservoir of orthobornaviruses","shrew species","majority of emerging infectious diseases","expressed endogenous bornaviral elements","unknown bornaviruses","wildlife reservoirs","genome of certain bat species","evidence of orthobornavirus specific amplicons","fixed paraffin-embedded material","screening","untypical staining pattern","subset","Germany","tissue slides of formalin","viral antigen","METHODS","different genera","BACKGROUND","date","CONCLUSIONS","BoDV","faint immunoreaction","fatal encephalitis","humans","question","mammals"],"language":"en"},

As the major sensor of UPR in eukaryotes, IRE1, in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, catalyzes the unconventional splicing of HAC1 in yeast, bZIP60 in plants and XBP1 in metazoans. Recent studies suggest that IRE1p and HAC1 mRNA, the only UPR pathway found in yeast, evolves as a cognate system responsible for the robust UPR induction. However, the functional connectivity of IRE1 and its splicing target in multicellular eukaryotes as well as the degree of conservation of IRE1 downstream signaling effectors across eukaryotes remains to be established. Here, we report that IRE1 and its substrate bZIP60 function as a strictly cognate enzyme-substrate pair to control viral pathogenesis in plants. Moreover, we show that the S1P/S2P-bZIP17/bZIP28 pathway, the other known branch of UPR in plants, does not play a detectable role in virus infection, demonstrating the distinct function of the IRE1-bZIP60 pathway in plants. Furthermore, we provide evidence that bZIP60 and HAC1, products of the enzyme-substrate duet, rather than IRE1, are functionally replaceable to cope with ER stress in yeast. Taken together, we conclude that the downstream signaling of the IRE1-mediated splicing is evolutionarily conserved in yeast and plants, and that the IRE1-bZIP60 UPR pathway not only confers overlapping functions with the other UPR branch in fundamental biology but also may exert a unique role in certain biological processes such as virus-plant interactions.","publish_time":"2015-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Lingrui; Chen, Hui; Brandizzi, Federica; Verchot, Jeanmarie; Wang, Aiming","journal":"PLoS Genet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/886c69ba9b7fb6441b3dc9c06d77abf30e3a0703.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4398384.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25875739/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IRE1-bZIP60 UPR pathway","IRE1-bZIP60 pathway","plants","IRE1-mediated splicing","UPR branch","bZIP60 mRNA","yeast","substrate bZIP60 function","functional connectivity of IRE1","known branch of UPR","robust UPR induction","major sensor of UPR","bZIP28 pathway","HAC1 mRNA","unconventional splicing of HAC1","cognate enzyme-substrate pair","splicing target","enzyme-substrate duet","ER stress","multicellular eukaryotes","S2P-bZIP17","S1P","site","unfolded protein response","distinct function","virus infection","unique role","detectable role","cognate system responsible","virus-plant interactions","certain biological processes","products","overlapping functions","endoplasmic reticulum","network","viral pathogenesis","IRE1p","pathways","XBP1","Recent studies","degree of conservation","fundamental biology","proteases","evidence","effectors","inositol","metazoans"],"language":"en"},

The most common high-risk HPV types in cervical cancer are HPV 16 and 18, and the most common low-risk types causing genital warts are HPV 6 and HPV 11. In this study, applying novel AllGlo fluorescent probes, we established a quadruplex quantitative PCR method to simultaneously detect and differentiate HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 in a single tube. METHODS: The specificity, the sensitivity, the detection limit, the reproducibility and the standard curve of this method were examined. Finally, clinical samples that had been tested previously by TaqMan PCR and HPV GenoArray (GA) test were used to verify the accuracy and sensitivity of the method. RESULTS: The assay has a sensitivity of 10(1) to 10(2) copies/test and a linear detection range from 10(1) to 10(8) copies/test. The mean amplification efficiencies for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 were 0.97, 1.10, 0.93 and 1.20, respectively, and the mean correlation coefficient (r(2)) of each standard curve was above 0.99 for plasmid templates ranging from 10(3) to 10(7) copies/test. There was 100% agreement between the AllGlo quadruplex quantitative PCR, HPV GA test and TaqMan uniplex qPCR methods. CONCLUSIONS: AllGlo quadruplex quantitative PCR in a single tube has the advantages of relatively high throughput, good reproducibility, high sensitivity, high specificity, and a wide linear range of detection. The convenient single tube format makes this assay a powerful tool for the studies of mixed infections by multiple pathogens, viral typing and viral load quantification.","publish_time":"2012-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Daojun; Chen, Yu; Wu, Shenghai; Wang, Baohong; Tang, Yi-Wei; Li, Lanjuan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b10c237281a6e5d61e8fff995dc8920465eda56.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3494670.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0048972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23152833/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPV","HPV GA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HPV GA test","HPV GenoArray","low-risk HPV","common high-risk HPV types","high sensitivity","AllGlo quadruplex quantitative PCR","quadruplex quantitative PCR method","TaqMan PCR","copies","high specificity","linear detection range","high throughput","common low-risk types","wide linear range of detection","detection limit","convenient single tube format","standard curve","assay","viral typing","good reproducibility","novel AllGlo fluorescent probes","TaqMan uniplex qPCR methods","viral load quantification","mean correlation coefficient","mean amplification efficiencies","multiple pathogens","studies of mixed infections","genital warts","cervical cancer","powerful tool","advantages","study","agreement","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","Human papillomaviruses","accuracy","plasmid templates","RESULTS","clinical samples"],"language":"en"},

Due to its immune modulation properties, they are commonly used in the therapeutic approach of various retroviral infections, namely human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). In HIV infection, it has been shown that IFN therapy limits early viral replication, particularly useful on post-exposure prophylaxis. In veterinary medicine, recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN-\u03C9) was the first interferon licensed for use in cats. Several studies have recently shown that this compound seems to stimulate the innate immunity, decreasing clinical signs and co-infections in naturally FIV-infected cats. More than summarizing the main conclusions about rFeIFN-\u03C9 in cats, this review emphasizes the immune-modulation properties of IFN therapy, opening new perspectives for its use in retroviral infections. Either in FIV-infected cats or in HIV individuals, type I IFNs seem to induce an innate immune-modulation and should not be overlooked as a therapeutic option in retroviral infections.","publish_time":"2016-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leal, Rodolfo Oliveira; Gil, Solange","journal":"Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8041d586dc357d38fb7e13f528d400a14ae64b8d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5606590.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29056740/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci3040032","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["co-infections","immune modulation properties","innate immune-modulation","FIV-infected cats","immune-modulation properties of IFN therapy","therapeutic approach of various retroviral infections","feline immunodeficiency virus","host immune response","rFeIFN-\u03C9","HIV individuals","IFNs","HIV infection","use","human immunodeficiency virus","IFN therapy limits","recombinant feline interferon omega","viral replication","main functions","innate immunity","main conclusions","therapeutic option","key components","new perspectives","clinical signs","veterinary medicine","review","well-known cytokines","post-exposure prophylaxis","compound","interferons","studies"],"language":"en"},

Also, we were able to rescue viable HCoV-229E mutants carrying replacements of SL2 with equivalent betacoronavirus structural elements.

Previously, we demonstrated that both MERS-CoV and BatCoV HKU4 use CD26 as a receptor, but how the BatCoVs evolved to bind CD26 is an intriguing question. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the S1 subunit C-terminal domain of HKU5 (HKU5-CTD), another BatCoV that is phylogenetically related to MERS-CoV but cannot bind to CD26. We observed that the conserved core subdomain and those of other betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs) have a similar topology of the external subdomain, indicating the same ancestor of lineage C betaCoVs. However, two deletions in two respective loops located in HKU5-CTD result in conformational variations in CD26-binding interface and are responsible for the non-binding of HKU5-CTD to CD26. Combined with sequence variation in the HKU5-CTD receptor binding interface, we propose the necessity for surveilling the mutation in BatCoV HKU5 spike protein in case of bat-to-human interspecies transmission.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Xue; Qi, Jianxun; Song, Hao; Wang, Qihui; Zhang, Yanfang; Wu, Ying; Lu, Guangwen; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Shi, Yi; Gao, George F.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c940298ee86fe96bd26a793b6498755794cd254.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111649.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217301241; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.04.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28432925/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217301241","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsxMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HKU5-CTD result","HKU5-CTD receptor binding interface","non-binding of HKU5","CD26-binding interface","MERS-CoV","BatCoV HKU5 spike protein","BatCoV HKU4 use CD26","S1 subunit C-terminal domain of HKU5","BatCoVs","case of bat","bat coronaviruses","ancestor of lineage C betaCoVs","external subdomain","conserved core subdomain","conformational variations","mutation","similar topology","respective loops","crystal structure","betacoronaviruses","necessity","Abstract Accumulating evidence","human interspecies transmission","sequence variation","deletions","intriguing question"],"language":"en"},

Design: A prospective descriptive study was carried out. Setting: Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of Istanbul Medeniyet University, Goztepe Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey. Patients: A total of 115 patients hospitalized in the PICU were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Children with underlying comorbidities and those who did not require mechanical ventilation were excluded. Main variables of interest: Demographic, clinical, laboratory test and radiographic data were recorded. Results: A total of 63 patients were eligible for the study. The most common diagnosis was bronchiolitis (57.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most frequent causal virus (36.5%). The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (28.6%). Multiple viral infection was identified in 20.6% of the patients, the most common in this subgroup being rhinovirus. Patients with bocavirus infection had a higher likelihood of needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at presentation. Children who died were likely to be \u003C 12 months old, have ARDS, hepatitis, pneumomediastinum, multiple viral infection, and required IMV support with an increased duration of MV. Additionally, they were found to have a high Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score, Predicted Death Rate and increased need for inotropic support at admission.

Lockdown is among options suggested to reduce spread of the virus. This study aimed to determining the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on Tunisian consumer awareness, attitudes and behaviors related to food wastage. An online survey was conducted during the first 2 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown. The survey collected information on demographic data, awareness and attitudes toward food waste, food purchase behavior and household food expenditure estimation; extent of household food waste; willingness and information needs to reduce food waste. This study included 284 respondents. About 89% of respondents claimed to be aware of food waste, and the COVID-19 lockdown would impact for 93% of respondents, their waste levels, and for 80%, their grocery shopping habits. Interestingly, the COVID-19 lockdown improved food shopping performances and pushed toward a positive behavioral change regarding food wastage: 85% respondents declared nothing of what they bought would be discarded, and most of the respondents have set up a strategy of saving, storing and eating leftovers. The most cited reasons given for discarding food were overcooking, inappropriate storage and overbuying. Consumers\u2019 changes in food waste prevention might be probably driven more by the socioeconomical context of the COVID-19 lockdown (i.e. food availability, restricted movements, loss of income), than by a pro-environmental concern. Finally, our study pointed out the consumers\u2019 needs of information for taking further action. In conclusion, our study can constitute a basis to further promote household food waste prevention behavior, outlasting the COVID-19 crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jribi, Sarra; Ben Ismail, Hanen; Doggui, Darine; Debbabi, Hajer","journal":"Environ Dev Sustain","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d79961ee9f2fe3e4255b19c500823db73f35ee0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166255.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-00740-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["food wastage","discarding food","food availability","aware of food waste","extent of household food waste","household food waste prevention behavior","food purchase behavior","respondents","lockdown improved food shopping performances","household food expenditure estimation","impact of COVID","waste levels","weeks of COVID","study","consumers\u2019 needs of information","attitudes","Consumers\u2019 changes","online survey","Tunisian consumer awareness","grocery shopping habits","behaviors","willingness","restricted movements","demographic data","positive behavioral change","loss of income","inappropriate storage","basis","cited reasons","pro-environmental concern","socioeconomical context","public health issue","spread","overbuying","strategy of saving","options","coronavirus disease","action","leftovers","conclusion","crisis"],"language":"en"},

However, the effectiveness and reliability of these approaches are not fully understood when the business environment is undergoing a major crisis. Building on organizational adaptation, strategic fit, and organizational decline streams of literature, we develop a framework that examines exploration and exploitation in crisis contexts. We argue that the severity of crisis a firm is exposed to acts as a positive contingency for the impact of exploration on firm performance level and variability, and as a negative contingency for exploitation\u2019s level and variability effects. Employing the multiplicative heteroscedasticity regression model on the data from 500 Russian SMEs, we test the proposed theoretical framework linking exploration and exploitation activities to the distribution of firm performance under different conditions of the firm-specific crisis severity. The results provide an improved understanding of strategic management approaches under economic crises and related turbulence.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Osiyevskyy, Oleksiy; Shirokova, Galina; Ritala, Paavo","journal":"J Bus Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4f456688a4b7d3e4b5161138473f2a945127842.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7180043.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296320302319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341610/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0148296320302319; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.04.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of crisis","firm-specific crisis severity","firm performance level","impact of exploration","major crisis","crisis contexts","distribution of firm performance","exploitation activities","organizational adaptation","strategic fit","exploitation\u2019s level","variability effects","negative contingency","positive contingency","improved understanding of strategic management approaches","proposed theoretical framework","generic strategies of firms\u0027 adaptation","organizational decline streams of literature","economic crises","different conditions","data","related turbulence","multiplicative heteroscedasticity regression model","Russian SMEs","environments","results","business environment","effectiveness","reliability"],"language":"en"},

However, methods for rapidly diagnosing antimicrobial resistance generally require multi-day culture-based assays. Macrolide efflux gene A, mef(A), provides resistance against erythromycin and azithromycin and is known to be laterally transferred among a wide range of bacterial species. METHODS: We use Recombinase Polymerase Assay (RPA) to detect the antimicrobial resistance gene mef(A) from raw lysates without nucleic acid purification. To validate these results we performed broth dilution assays to assess antimicrobial resistance to erythromycin and ampicillin (a negative control). RESULTS: We validate the detection of mef(A) in raw lysates of Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius, and Enterococcus faecium bacterial lysates within 7\u201310 min of assay time. We show that detection of mef(A) accurately predicts real antimicrobial resistance assessed by traditional culture methods, and that the assay is robust to high levels of spiked-in non-specific nucleic acid contaminant. The assay was unaffected by single-nucleotide polymorphisms within divergent mef(A) gene sequences, strengthening its utility as a robust diagnostic tool. CONCLUSIONS: This finding opens the door to implementation of rapid genomic diagnostics in a clinical setting, while providing researchers a rapid, cost-effective tool to track antibiotic resistance in both pathogens and commensal strains.","publish_time":"2019-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nelson, Megan M.; Waldron, Christopher L.; Bracht, John R.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/179338a972eb486bae25e1898b54441c7534e0b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6373131.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-3762-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjsyMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antimicrobial resistance gene mef","Emerging antimicrobial resistance","real antimicrobial resistance","antibiotic resistance","detection of mef","divergent mef","assay time","traditional culture methods","erythromycin","gene sequences","Recombinase Polymerase Assay","results","raw lysates of Streptococcus pyogenes","Enterococcus faecium bacterial lysates","nucleic acid purification","robust diagnostic tool","Macrolide efflux gene","non-specific nucleic acid contaminant","cost-effective tool","multi-day culture-based assays","broth dilution assays","implementation of rapid genomic diagnostics","wide range of bacterial species","salivarius","high levels of spiked","significant threat","single-nucleotide polymorphisms","clinical setting","door","pneumoniae","researchers","utility","ampicillin","RPA","pathogens","human health","commensal strains","negative control","BACKGROUND","azithromycin","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Such point-of-need (PON), low-cost diagnostics are essential for ZIKV control in vulnerable areas with limited resources. METHODS: We developed and evaluated a ZIKV-specific field-deployable RT-iiPCR reagent set targeting the E gene for rapid detection of ZIKV in ZIKV-spiked human and mosquito specimens, and compared its performance to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) RT-qPCR assays targeting the E and NS2B genes, respectively. RESULTS: These assays demonstrated exclusive specificity for ZIKV (African and Asian lineages), had limits of detection ranging from 10 to 100 in vitro transcribed RNA copies/\u03BCl and detection endpoints at 10 plaque forming units/ml of infectious tissue culture fluid. Analysis of human whole blood, plasma, serum, semen, urine, and mosquito pool samples spiked with ZIKV showed an agreement of 90% (k = 0.80), 92% (k = 0.82), 95% (k = 0.86), 92% (k = 0.81), 90% (k = 0.79), and 100% (k = 1), respectively, between the RT-iiPCR assay and composite results from the reference RT-qPCR assays. Overall, the concurrence between the ZIKV RT-iiPCR and the reference RT-qPCR assays was 92% (k = 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: The ZIKV RT-iiPCR has a performance comparable to the reference CDC and PAHO RT-qPCR assays but provides much faster results (~1.5 h) with a field-deployable system that can be utilized as a PON diagnostic with the potential to significantly improve the quality of the health care system in vulnerable areas.

Aerosols of PRRS virus were exposed to one of four doses of UV254 under nine combinations of temperature (n =3) and relative humidity (n =3). Inactivation constants (k), defined as the absolute value of the slope of the linear relationship between the survival fraction of the microbial population and the UV254 exposure dose, were estimated using the random coefficient model. The associated UV254 half-life dose for each combination of environmental factors was determined as (log10 2/k) and expressed as UV254 mJ per unit volume. The effects of UV254 dose, temperature, and relative humidity were all statistically significant, as were the interactions between UV254 dose\u00D7temperature and UV254 dose\u00D7relative humidity. PRRS virus was more susceptible to ultraviolet as temperature decreased; most susceptible to ultraviolet inactivation at relative humidity between 25% and 79%, less susceptible at relative humidity \u226424%, and least susceptible at \u226580% relative humidity. The current study allows for calculating the dose of UV254 required to inactivate airborne PRRS virus under various laboratory and field conditions using the inactivation constants and UV254 half-life doses reported therein.","publish_time":"2012-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cutler, Timothy D.; Wang, Chong; Hoff, Steven J.; Zimmerman, Jeffrey J.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d11a280063358d36fb38fad6fdf64489796e56ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126551.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22542268/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113512002118; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.03.044; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113512002118","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjszNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dose of UV254","relative humidity","effects of UV254 dose","doses of UV254","UV254 exposure dose","UV254 mJ","associated UV254 half-life dose","UV254 half-life doses","ultraviolet inactivation","effects of temperature","airborne PRRS virus","combinations of temperature","Inactivation constants","Aerosols of PRRS virus","inactivation of airborne porcine reproductive","ultraviolet light","respiratory syndrome","field conditions","various laboratory","microbial population","survival fraction","combination of environmental factors","linear relationship","slope","interactions","unit volume","absolute value","random coefficient model","log10","research","current study","objective"],"language":"en"},

ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein with its active site domain exposed to the extracellular surface of endothelial cells and the renal tubular epithelium. Here ACE2 is poised to metabolise circulating peptides which may include angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor and the product of angiotensin I cleavage by ACE. To this end, ACE2 may counterbalance the effects of ACE within the renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS). Indeed, ACE2 has been implicated in the regulation of heart and renal function where it is proposed to control the levels of angiotensin II relative to its hypotensive metabolite, angiotensin-(1\u20137). The recent solution of the structure of ACE2, and ACE, has provided new insight into the substrate and inhibitor profiles of these two key regulators of the RAS.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 50 Finnish military recruits with clinically diagnosed ARS in spring 2012. METHODS: We collected symptom, nasal endoscopy, and cone\u2010beam CT (CBCT) scores during the early (2\u20133 days from onset) and later phases (9\u201310 days). We took viral samples from the nasopharynx (multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), bacterial culture from the middle meatus during both phases, and both viral and bacterial samples from the maxillary sinus aspirate (respiratory virus PCR, bacterial culture, broad\u2010range bacterial PCR) during the later phase. Cilia destruction and microbial biofilms were sought from a nasal mucosal biopsy sample. RESULTS: We found that 42 (84%) of the subjects had viral nucleic acid in the nasopharynx during ARS. During the early phase, 28 (56%) of the subjects had nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) in the middle meatus, which was associated with wider paranasal mucosal changes in CBCT scans and increased symptoms during the study period. After 9 to 10 days from the onset, NTHi was found in the maxillary sinus in eight subjects (40%, 8/20) and led to prolonged symptoms. Bacterial biofilm was ruled out in 39 (78%) cases, and cilia destruction did not correlate with microbiological or clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Nasal and paranasal H. influenzae coinfection during viral infection may modify the symptoms and the extent of sinonasal mucosal disease observed in CBCT scans already from the beginning of the ARS episode.

In this study, 3-week-old SPF PCV2-seronegative piglets were inoculated intranasally with PCV2. The effect of immunostimulation on the induction of PMWS was investigated by immunisation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) emulsified in incomplete Freunds adjuvant. The study was terminated 5 weeks after inoculation. While disease was not observed in the age-matched controls, two out of five non-immunised PCV2-infected piglets died on postinoculation day (PID) 21, and one was euthanized on PID 25 in moribund condition. These animals had appeared lethargic with persistent fever from PID 12 onwards. The euthanized pig appeared smaller than littermates and suffered from jaundice. At postmortem examination, gastric ulceration, icterus, and liver and thymus atrophy were observed. Furthermore, histological lesions of degenerating hepatocytes and hepatitis in combination with lymphoid depletion and syncytial cells in lymph nodes were consistent with the diagnosis of PMWS. One out of five immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets was euthanized on PID 22 with convulsions after a period with wasting. This pig was lethargic from PID 14 onwards with persistent fever from PID 8 and transient dyspnoea. No differences in clinical signs, gross pathologic or histological findings were observed for the remaining non-immunostimulated and immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets. All 10 PCV2-inoculated piglets seroconverted to PCV2 within 14 days after inoculation. By virus isolation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and immunostaining of cryostat sections, it was demonstrated that lymphoid tissue contained abundant PCV2 antigen. Viral DNA load in serum samples was assessed by Q-PCR. All four PMWS-affected piglets had high levels of PCV2 DNA in serum, suggesting that there was a correlation between high levels of viral DNA in serum and the development of PMWS. In conclusion, infection with PCV2 caused PMWS in SPF piglets, however, the immunostimulation did not seem to play a critical role.","publish_time":"2002-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ladekj\u00E6r-Mikkelsen, A.-S; Nielsen, J; Stadejek, T; Storgaard, T; Krakowka, S; Ellis, J; McNeilly, F; Allan, G; B\u00F8tner, A","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6035da5eaf6e91fa920d862fd6050de8092b90c2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117141.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113502001748; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113502001748","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU4LmNzdjs0MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1747941,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"IN0JoqRjDgd3YoZDLe5HjA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_58.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMWS","PID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PCV2-inoculated piglets","immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets","PID","non-immunised PCV2-infected piglets","SPF piglets","high levels of PCV2 DNA","week-old SPF PCV2-seronegative piglets","abundant PCV2 antigen","diagnosis of PMWS","induction of PMWS","development of PMWS","euthanized pig","high levels of viral DNA","serum samples","Viral DNA load","persistent fever","Q-PCR","study","lymphoid depletion","histological findings","lymphoid tissue","effect of immunostimulation","histological lesions of degenerating hepatocytes","icterus","KLH","combination","syncytial cells","hepatitis","quantitative polymerase chain reaction","lymph nodes","immunisation","clinical signs","liver","gastric ulceration","virus isolation","syndrome","porcine circovirus type","keyhole limpet hemocyanin","postinoculation day","postmortem examination","recognised pathogen","differences","Abstract Postweaning multisystemic","littermates","correlation","infection","incomplete Freunds adjuvant","transient dyspnoea","immunostaining of cryostat sections","thymus atrophy","animals","conclusion","days","age-matched controls","jaundice","weeks","moribund condition","convulsions","period","swine","critical role","disease"],"language":"en"},

Detection of likely etiologic agents of respiratory infections can help direct management and can also play an important role in disease surveillance. For this purpose, we are still reliant on many traditional diagnostic tools that have been used for decades in order to determine the microbial etiology of respiratory infections. However, these tools have been increasingly supplemented by newer methods, particular molecular diagnostic techniques, which have enabled the more rapid detection of many pathogens that were previously difficult to detect. These advances have particularly lead to improvements in the ability to detect respiratory viruses and also other microorganisms that do not normally colonize the respiratory tract. Recognition of the existence of the lung microbiome has challenged the traditional views of pneumonia pathogenesis and may provide the opportunity for new diagnostic tools that are focused on more than just detection of specific known pathogens.

Nevertheless, further experimental studies are desired for a confidential evaluation of the postulated hypotheses.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tilocca, Bruno; Soggiu, Alessio; Musella, Vincenzo; Britti, Domenico; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Urbani, Andrea; Roncada, Paola","journal":"Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/21472f7d3dd86085a366b5f487354824b812f12c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102648.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457920300484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32194253/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457920300484; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.03.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["Hubei province","infected dogs shield humans","violent immune reaction responsible","severe clinical outcomes","past contact","China","mild form of infection","confidential evaluation","Spike protein epitopes","intervention","recurrent virus exposure","progressive recover","related coronaviruses","Antibody Dependent Enhancement","circulating SARS-CoV","biological mechanisms worthy of attention","COVID","patients","experimental studies","high-homology","postulated hypotheses","Elseways","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

In animal immunogenicity studies, we found that most anti-rN protein antibodies were IgG2a in BALB/c mice vaccinated with rN emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 containing the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide, CpG. In contrast, anti-rN protein antibodies of mice immunized with rN protein in PBS were found to mainly be IgG1. These results indicated that ISA-51/CpG-formulated rN protein was dramatically biased toward a Th1 immune response. To identify the B-cell immunodominant epitopes of the rN protein in the mouse and monkey, the reactivities of antisera raised against purified rN proteins formulated in ISA-51/CpG were tested with a panel of overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire N protein sequence. Three immunodominant linear B-cell epitope regions were mapped to residues 166\u2013180, 356\u2013375, and 396\u2013410 of the rN protein. When the reactivities of these peptides were screened with human sera from five SARS patients, peptides corresponding to residues 156\u2013175 reacted strongly with sera from two of the SARS patients. These results indicated that the region around residues 156\u2013175 of the N protein is immunogenic in the mouse, monkey, and human. We found that peptides corresponding to residues 1\u201330, 86\u2013100, 306\u2013320, and 351\u2013365 contained murine immunodominant T-cell epitopes. To identify functional CTL epitopes of the N protein, BALB/c mice were immunized with peptides containing the H-2Kd CTL motif emulsified in adjuvant ISA-51/CpG. Using an IFN-\u03B3 secretion cell assay and analysis by flow cytometry, peptides containing residues 81\u201395 were found to be capable of stimulating both CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B cell proliferation in vitro. We also only observed that peptides corresponding to residues 336\u2013350 were capable of stimulating IFN-\u03B3 production in T-cell cultures derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of macaques immunized with the rN protein emulsified in ISA/CpG adjuvant.

In this study, we present a transgene-encoded biosensor that can accurately, sensitively and quantitatively report the proteolytic activity of EV71 3C(pro). This biosensor is based on the catalyzed activity of a pro\u2013interleukin (IL)-1\u03B2-enterovirus 3C(pro) cleavage site-Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc) fusion protein that we named i-3CS-GLuc. GLuc enzyme is inactive in the fusion protein because of aggregation caused by pro\u2013IL-1\u03B2. However, the 3C(pro) of EV71 and other enteroviruses, such as coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and poliovirus can recognize and process the canonical enterovirus 3C(pro) cleavage site between pro\u2013IL-1\u03B2 and GLuc, thereby releasing and activating GLuc and resulting in increased luciferase activity.

Engineering simulation, which employs computational fluid dynamics, provides a convenient means of investigating airflow behaviour in isolation rooms for various ventilation arrangements. A cough model was constructed to permit the numerical simulation of virus diffusion inside an isolation room for different ventilation system configurations. An analysis of the region of droplet fallout and the dilution time of virus diffusion of coughed gas in the isolation room was also performed for each ventilation arrangement. The numerical results presented in this paper indicate that the parallel-directional airflow pattern is the most effective means of controlling flows containing virus droplets. Additionally, staggering the positions of the supply vents at the door end of the room relative to the exhaust vents on the wall behind the bed head provides effective infection control and containment. These results suggest that this particular ventilation arrangement enhances the safety of staff when performing medical treatments within isolation rooms.","publish_time":"2006-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kao, P.

We identified overlapping 99.39% conserved 1 CD8 \u002B T-cell epitope (MMHPSFAGM) from N protein and 100% conserved 7 epitopes (AVFALAPVV, LAVFALAPV, FALAPVVFA, VFALAPVVF, IAMTVLPAL, FFDWFSGLM, and FLLIYLGRT) from G protein and also identified IL-4 and IFN-\u03B3 induced (99.39% conserved) 1 N protein CD4 \u002B T-cell epitope (HMMHPSFAGMVDPSL) and 100% conserved 5 G protein CD4 \u002B T-cell epitopes (LPALAVFALAPVVFA, PALAVFALAPVVFAE, GIAMTVLPALAVFAL, GSWNFFDWFSGLMSW, and FFLLIYLGRTGLSKM). The overlapping CD8 \u002B and CD4 \u002B T-cell epitopes were bound with most conserved HLA-C*12:03 and HLA-DRB1*01:01, respectively with the high binding affinity (kcal/mol). The combined population coverage analysis revealed that the allele frequencies of these epitopes are high in endemic and non-endemic regions. Besides, we found 100% conserved and non-allergenic 2 decamer B-cell epitopes, GVCEVGVQAL and RVFNCIDWVH of G protein had the sequence similarity with the nonamer CD8 \u002B T-cell epitopes, VCEVGVQAL and RVFNCIDWV, respectively. Consequently, these epitopes may be used for the development of epitope-based peptide vaccine against emerging RVFV. However, in vivo and in vitro experiments are required for their efficient use as a vaccine.","publish_time":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adhikari, Utpal Kumar; Rahman, M.

These interventions dampen virus spread by reducing contact between infected and susceptible persons. Because they curtail essential societal activities, they must be applied judiciously. Optimal control theory is an approach for modeling and balancing competing objectives such as epidemic spread and NPI cost. METHODS: We apply optimal control on an epidemiologic compartmental model to develop triggers for NPI implementation. The objective is to minimize expected person-days lost from influenza related deaths and NPI implementations for the model. We perform a multivariate sensitivity analysis based on Latin Hypercube Sampling to study the effects of input parameters on the optimal control policy. Additional studies investigated the effects of departures from the modeling assumptions, including exponential terminal time and linear NPI implementation cost. RESULTS: An optimal policy is derived for the control model using a linear NPI implementation cost. Linear cost leads to a \u0022bang-bang\u0022 policy in which NPIs are applied at maximum strength when certain state criteria are met. Multivariate sensitivity analyses are presented which indicate that NPI cost, death rate, and recovery rate are influential in determining the policy structure. Further death rate, basic reproductive number and recovery rate are the most influential in determining the expected cumulative death. When applying the NPI policy, the cumulative deaths under exponential and gamma terminal times are close, which implies that the outcome of applying the \u0022bang-bang\u0022 policy is insensitive to the exponential assumption. Quadratic cost leads to a multi-level policy in which NPIs are applied at varying strength levels, again based on certain state criteria. Results indicate that linear cost leads to more costly implementation resulting in fewer deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The application of optimal control theory can provide valuable insight to developing effective control strategies for pandemic.

Alternative methodologies have been introduced in an effort to improve turnaround times. One such system, the R-mix\u2122 shell vial is discussed herein. The study objectives were: (a) to establish R-mix\u2122 testing parameters as compared to direct antigen testing (DAT) and CC, and (b) to assess technical aspects and cost of R-mix\u2122 in a high volume clinical virology laboratory. Study design A prospective analysis of respiratory samples submitted to the clinical virology laboratory between November 2004 and April 2005 was performed. All specimens were inoculated onto R-mix\u2122 shell vials (SV) and CC tubes; and a subset also underwent DAT for influenza A and B and/or RSV. A retrospective estimated cost analysis was made. Results A total of 563 samples were included in the study, which collectively revealed a total of 207 viruses. Sensitivity of R-mix\u2122 for seven major respiratory viruses ranged from 45% to 83% compared to CC and DAT, while mean time to detection (TTD) varied from 1.1 to 1.4 days. In addition to these viruses, 23 picornaviruses, 11 CMV isolates and 5 HSV isolates were detected by CC alone. Conclusions The R-mix\u2122 system has similar sensitivity as CC for the detection of parainfluenza 1\u20133 and influenza A/B while dramatically reducing the TTD. Furthermore, it is significantly more sensitive and produces more timely results for RSV than CC; yet, neither method offers a diagnostic benefit over rapid DAT for RSV detection. The sensitivity of R-mix\u2122 for adenovirus appears to be significantly lower than that of CC. Lastly, methodologies other than R-mix\u2122 must remain in place under circumstances where identification of other potential viral respiratory pathogens, including herpesviruses and picornaviruses, is desired.","publish_time":"2007-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"LaSala, P.

METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study, involving 27 referral maternity hospitals in five Brazilian regions. Cases were identified in a prospective surveillance by using the WHO standardized criteria for potentially life-threatening conditions (PLTC) and maternal near miss (MNM). Women with severe complications from respiratory disease identified as suspected or confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza or respiratory failure were compared to those with other causes of severe morbidity. A review of suspected H1N1 influenza cases classified women as non-tested, tested positive and tested negative, comparing their outcomes. Factors associated with severe maternal outcome (SMO = MNM \u002B MD) were assessed in both groups, in comparison to PLTC, using PR and 95 % CI adjusted for design effect of cluster sampling. RESULTS: Among 9555 cases of severe maternal morbidity, 485 (5 %) had respiratory disease. Respiratory disease occurred in one-quarter of MNM cases and two-thirds of MD. H1N1 virus was suspected in 206 cases with respiratory illness. Around 60 % of these women were tested, yielding 49 confirmed cases. Confirmed H1N1 influenza cases had worse adverse outcomes (MNM:MD ratio \u003C 1 (0.9:1), compared to 12:1 in cases due to other causes), and a mortality index \u003E 50 %, in comparison to 7.4 % in other causes of severe maternal morbidity. Delay in medical care was associated with SMO in all cases considered, with a two-fold increased risk among respiratory disease patients. Perinatal outcome was worse in cases complicated by respiratory disease, with increased prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight and Apgar score \u003C 7. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory disease, especially considering the influenza season, is a very severe cause of maternal near miss and death. Increased awareness about this condition, preventive vaccination during pregnancy, early diagnosis and treatment are required to improve maternal health.","publish_time":"2016-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pfitscher, L.

Patients with RSV had a median length of stay of 9 days (6\u201325), and 57% of them (30/53) had complications, including pneumonia (23/53, 44%) and respiratory failure (15/53, 28%). Fifteen per cent (8/53) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 8% (4/53). Pneumonia was more likely to occur in patients with RSV than in patients with RSV-negative ILI (44% (23/53) versus 26% (362/1393), p 0.006) or with influenza virus infection (44% versus 28% (157/560), p 0.02). Conclusion RSV is an infrequent cause of ILI during periods of influenza virus circulation but can cause severe complications in hospitalized adults. Risk factors for RSV detection in adults hospitalized with ILI include cancer and immunosuppressive treatment. Specific immunization and antiviral therapy might benefit patients at risk.","publish_time":"2017-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Loubet, P.; Lenzi, N.; Valette, M.; Foulongne, V.; Krivine, A.; Houhou, N.; Lagathu, G.; Rogez, S.; Alain, S.; Duval, X.; Galtier, F.; Postil, D.; Tattevin, P.; Vanhems, P.; Carrat, F.; Lina, B.; Launay, O.; Seddik, K.; Lesieur, Z.; Bonmarin, I.; Loulergue, P.; Bodilis, H.; Servera-Miyalou, M.; Sadler, I.; Momcilovic, S.; Kanaan, R.; Coolent, N.; Tan Boun, K.; Blanche, P.; Charpentier, J.; Daviaud, F.; Mongardon, N.; Bretagnol, A.; Claessens, Y.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that occurred in Hong Kong in 2003 caused serious public health consequences. Its impacts on health-seeking behaviors of the general public have not been assessed. Methods. Two cross-sectional, random telephone surveys interviewed 1603 Hong Kong adult residents in the post-SARS epidemic period, June and September 2003 to investigate changes in the post-SARS period. Results. Noteworthy percentages of the respondents self-reported increased frequencies of practicing favorable health-seeking behaviors in June 2003, as compared with the pre-SARS period. Few respondents reported the opposite. This was observed in different dimensions: health services seeking, adoption of healthier lifestyle, spending more resources on health, adoption of good personal hygiene, mask use when ill with influenza, and avoidance of risk behaviors. The frequencies of practicing most of these health-seeking behaviors, as measured in June and September 2003, were comparable. Further increases in healthy diet and weight control, etc., were observed during that period. Those who worried about contracting SARS were more likely to have improved health-seeking behaviors. Conclusions. The community in Hong Kong responded to the SARS epidemic by practicing more favorable health-seeking behaviors. Public health workers should utilize these opportunities to foster favorable changes.","publish_time":"2005-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Joseph T.F.; Yang, Xilin; Tsui, H.

Several factors are sharpening the tension between the supply and demand for high quality health information, and the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide a high-profile example. With thousands of indicators recommended but few measured well, the worldwide health community needs to focus its efforts on improving measurement of a small set of priority areas. Priority indicators should be selected on the basis of public-health significance and several dimensions of measurability. Health statistics can be divided into three types: crude, corrected, and predicted. Health statistics are necessary inputs to planning and strategic decision making, programme implementation, monitoring progress towards targets, and assessment of what works and what does not. Crude statistics that are biased have no role in any of these steps; corrected statistics are preferred. For strategic decision making, when corrected statistics are unavailable, predicted statistics can play an important part. For monitoring progress towards agreed targets and assessment of what works and what does not, however, predicted statistics should not be used. Perhaps the most effective method to decrease controversy over health statistics and to encourage better primary data collection and the development of better analytical methods is a strong commitment to provision of an explicit data audit trail. This initiative would make available the primary data, all post-data collection adjustments, models including covariates used for farcasting and forecasting, and necessary documentation to the public.","publish_time":"2007-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Murray, Christopher JL","journal":"The Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/55a09d0431a0a229503564966c187411cc01025d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7137868.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673607604152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17350457/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(07)60415-2; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673607604152","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs3ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Summary Health statistics","predicted statistics","corrected statistics","Crude statistics","health significance","worldwide health community","high quality health information","health-related Millennium Development Goals","increasing number of worldwide health controversies","better primary data collection","post-data collection adjustments","strategic decision making","targets","monitoring progress","assessment","Priority indicators","explicit data audit trail","development of better analytical methods","necessary inputs","necessary documentation","basis of public","thousands of indicators","small set of priority areas","provision","strong commitment","MDGs","demand","covariates","models","programme implementation","centre","farcasting","supply","measurement","forecasting","efforts","controversy","dimensions of measurability","effective method","tension","initiative","steps","high-profile example","role","types","factors"],"language":"en"},

We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students\u2019 psychological needs during the MERS-CoV outbreak should be addressed appropriately. Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs for medical students during an infectious disease outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Rabiaah, Abdulkarim; Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Al-Eyadhy, Ayman A.; Hasan, Gamal M.; Al-Zamil, Fahad; Al-Subaie, Sarah; Alsohime, Fahad; Jamal, Amr; Alhaboob, Ali; Al-Saadi, Basma; Somily, Ali Mohammed","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2ddc27af58ab8e3eb3371c9f67198f87df9fbbd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3a76cfcb2772d209f1eb0ab9f48d3edda2c4fdd7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102651.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.01.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120300058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32001194/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034120300058","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GAD"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["generalized anxiety score","higher self-reported anxiety","MERS-CoV outbreak","severe anxiety","minimal anxiety","mild anxiety","moderate anxiety","Generalized Anxiety Disorder","mean GAD score","high public anxiety","knowledge score","MERS-CoV epidemic impact","Female students","self-reported social avoidance","psychological distress","significant predictors","borderline significant correlation","Medical students\u2019 psychological needs","Perceived sufficiency of information score","higher mean stress level","medical students\u2019 perception","psychological support programs","increased self-report","infectious disease outbreak","participants","study","median","RESULTS","public fear","female gander","College of Medicine","numbers of resources access","common source of information","number of accessed resources","highest risk of infection","hygienic habits","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus","King Saud University","Riyadh","OBJECTIVES","determinants","variables","males","model","Saudi Arabia","BACKGROUND","hospital announcements","affected countries","CONCLUSIONS","terms","scale","Media speculations","healthcare community","predesigned questionnaire","collected data","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Nevertheless, it has been hypothesized that virus interference might lead to a correlation between receipt of influenza vaccination and increased risk of infection with other respiratory viruses. We investigated whether such a phenomenon might affect a study design commonly used to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). We searched publications in MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science. We identified 12 studies using the test-negative design (2011\u20132017) that reported VE estimates separately derived by 3 alternative control groups: 1) all patients testing negative for influenza (FLU), VE(FLU\u2212); 2) patients who tested positive for other/another respiratory virus (ORV), VE(ORV\u002B); and 3) patients who tested negative for all viruses in the panel (PAN), VE(PAN\u2212). These included VE estimates from 7 countries for all age groups from 2003/2004 to 2013/2014. We observed no difference in vaccination coverage between the ORV-positive and PAN-negative control groups. A total of 63 VE(FLU\u2212) estimates, 62 VE(ORV\u002B) estimates, and 33 VE(PAN\u2212) estimates were extracted. Pooled estimates of the difference in VE (\u0394VE) were very similar between groups. In meta-regression, no association was found between the selection of control group and VE estimates. In conclusion, we did not find any differences in VE estimates based on the choice of control group.","publish_time":"2017-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Shuo; Cowling, Benjamin J; Kelly, Heath; Sullivan, Sheena G","journal":"American Journal of Epidemiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9ff2403f8870c64dbb5b6c7ee549d0e94f77257.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5860156.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-pdf/187/2/389/24331203/kwx251.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28641373/; https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwx251","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["included VE estimates","PAN-negative control groups","Pooled estimates","control selection","alternative control groups","selection of control group","case-control studies","ORV-positive","choice of control group","patients","age groups","test-negative design","receipt of influenza vaccination","respiratory viruses","influenza vaccine effectiveness","vaccination coverage","study design","virus interference","increased risk of infection","correlation","countries","PubMed","important assumption","\u0394VE","panel","MEDLINE","association","independent of exposure","Web of Science","meta-regression","publications","phenomenon","total","differences","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

Studies from Europe have shown that coronaviruses circulate in bats in France but this reflects only a fraction of the whole diversity. In the current study the diversity of coronaviruses circulating in western Europe was extensively explored. Ten alphacoronaviruses in eleven bat species belonging to the Miniopteridae, Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae families and, a SARS-CoV-related Betacoronavirus in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum were identified. The diversity and prevalence of bat coronaviruses presently reported from western Europe is much higher than previously described and includes a SARS-CoV sister group. This diversity demonstrates the dynamic evolution and circulation of coronaviruses in this species. That said, the identified coronaviruses were consistently associated with a particular bat species or genus, and these relationships were maintained no matter the geographic location. The observed phylogenetic grouping of coronaviruses from the same species in Europe and Asia, emphasizes the role of host/pathogen coevolution in this group.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ar Gouilh, Meriadeg; Puechmaille, S\u00E9bastien J.; Diancourt, Laure; Vandenbogaert, Mathias; Serra-Cobo, Jordi; Lopez Ro\u00EFg, Marc; Brown, Paul; Moutou, Fran\u00E7ois; Caro, Val\u00E9rie; Vabret, Astrid; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b57cbdeed383aa2950a42bc015f1be47e85a0d22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112086.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682218300205; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682218300205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29482919/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.01.014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs4NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["France","Europe","Rhinolophus","Asia"],"keyphrases":["identified coronaviruses","high diversity of coronaviruses","circulation of coronaviruses","prevalence of bat coronaviruses","western Europe","particular bat species","MERS-CoV","observed phylogenetic grouping of coronaviruses","SARS-CoV sister group","emergence of SARS","bats","role of host","Miniopteridae","related Betacoronavirus","discovery","Rhinolophidae families","pathogen coevolution","relationships","Vespertilionidae","Rhinolophus ferrumequinum","genus","Asia","dynamic evolution","matter","France","current study","geographic location","fraction","alphacoronaviruses","Studies"],"language":"en"},

Angiotensin II, a key effector peptide of the system, causes vasoconstriction and exerts multiple biological functions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, and capillary blood vessels in the lung are one of the major sites of ACE expression and angiotensin II production in the human body. The RAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, both commonly seen in chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease. Recent studies indicate that the RAS also plays a critical role in acute lung diseases, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ACE2, a close homologue of ACE, functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system and was identified as a key receptor for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus infections. In the lung, ACE2 protects against acute lung injury in several animal models of ARDS. Thus, the RAS appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Indeed, increasing ACE2 activity might be a novel approach for the treatment of acute lung failure in several diseases.","publish_time":"2006-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuba, Keiji; Imai, Yumiko; Penninger, Josef M","journal":"Current Opinion in Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85d7f47649ef43ff11b8d5196c98e4fdacd0f905.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106490.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1471489206000579; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471489206000579","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs5NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RAS","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute lung diseases","pathogenesis of acute lung injury","chronic lung diseases","treatment of acute lung failure","RAS","renin-angiotensin system","key role","chronic obstructive lung disease","critical role","severe acute respiratory syndrome","acute respiratory distress syndrome","central role","key receptor","ACE2 activity","key effector peptide","close homologue of ACE","pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension","major sites of ACE expression","pulmonary fibrosis","blood pressure homeostasis","animal models of ARDS","capillary blood vessels","multiple biological functions","SARS","novel approach","vasoconstriction","production","coronavirus infections","negative regulator","fluid","human body","enzyme","salt balance","Recent studies"],"language":"en"},

Virus emergence requires overlap between host populations, alterations in virus genetics to permit infection of new hosts, and adaptation to novel hosts such that between\u2010host transmission is sustainable, all of which are the purview of the fields of ecology and evolution. A firm understanding of the ecology of viruses and how they evolve is required for understanding how and why viruses emerge. In this paper, I address the evolutionary mechanisms of virus emergence and how they relate to virus ecology. I argue that, while virus acquisition of the ability to infect new hosts is not difficult, limited evolutionary trajectories to sustained virus between\u2010host transmission and the combined effects of mutational meltdown, bottlenecking, demographic stochasticity, density dependence, and genetic erosion in ecological sinks limit most emergence events to dead\u2010end spillover infections.

First of all, there is no universally common ancestor of viruses. That is, viruses are polyphyletic and, so far, it has not been possible to construct a tree of viruses or to include them in the tree of life. Yet we classify and study viruses in the realm of biological sciences for a number of reasons. Viruses have exploited the nucleic acid and sequence space to their limits; they have also managed to create strategies of encoding information and expressing it in a unique manner that is foreign to cellular organisms; they vary in shape and form, infect only one host or a myriad of hosts, and some insert themselves into the genome of their host, changing its real-time performance or even its evolutionary history, sometimes benefiting the host or causing its death. In this chapter we briefly review the diversity in virus structure, genome organization, and features of virus replication in cells or organisms they infect; essentially we examine the ways viruses have become conspicuously present in our lives and how we seek to organize and make sense of their diversity.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fermin, Gustavo","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a2cce99039a3ce14630260424bdca8a3c4bf9258.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149880.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128112571000024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128112571000024","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["classification of viruses","tree of viruses","study viruses","ways viruses","common ancestor of viruses","cellular organisms","diversity","established biological classification","virus structure","genome organization","tree of life","features of virus replication","realm of biological sciences","restricted hierarchical system of orders","subfamilies","genera","nucleic acid","sequence space","real-time performance","evolutionary history","unique manner","cells","number of reasons","limits","species","shape","strategies of encoding information","myriad of hosts","Summary","lives","chapter","sense","death"],"language":"en"},

Despite the announcement of post-pandemic period on 10 August 2010 by theWHO, H1N1 (2009) virus would continue to circulate as a seasonal virus for some years and national health authorities should remain vigilant due to unpredictable behaviour of the virus. Majority of the world population is living in countries with inadequate resources to purchase vaccines and stockpile antiviral drugs. Basic hygienic measures such as wearing face masks and the hygienic practice of hand washing could reduce the spread of the respiratory viruses. However, the imminent issue is translating these measures into day-to-day practice. The experience from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong has shown that general practitioners (GPs) were willing to discharge their duties despite risks of getting infected themselves. SARS event has highlighted the inadequate interface between primary and secondary care and valuable health care resources were thus inappropriately matched to community needs. There are various ways for GPs to contribute in combating the influenza pandemic. They are prompt in detecting and monitoring epidemics and mini-epidemics of viral illnesses in the community. They can empower and raise the health literacy of the community such as advocating personal hygiene and other precautious measures. GPs could also assist in the development of protocols for primary care management of patients with flu-like illnesses and conduct clinical audits on the standards of preventive and treatment measures. GPs with adequate liaison with public health agencies would facilitate early diagnosis of patients with influenza. In this article, we summarise the primary care actions for phases 4-6 of the pandemic. We shall discuss the novel roles of GPs as alternative source of health care for patients who would otherwise be cared for in the secondary care level. The health care system would thus remain sustainable during the public health crisis.","publish_time":"2010-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Albert; Chuh, Antonio AT","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/357a008270023e621d758ada372b14e676edb782.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2988738.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21044300/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-10-661","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["health care system","valuable health care resources","alternative source of health care","health literacy","influenza pandemic","primary care actions","primary care management of patients","public health agencies","secondary care level","public health crisis","pandemic of H1N1 influenza","national health authorities","seasonal influenza","precautious measures","treatment measures","seasonal virus","Basic hygienic measures","novel roles of GPs","inadequate resources","community needs","announcement of post-pandemic period","early diagnosis of patients","inadequate interface","mini-epidemics","monitoring epidemics","viral illnesses","hygienic practice of hand washing","SARS event","respiratory viruses","day-to-day practice","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","vaccines","face masks","Hong Kong","standards of preventive","countries","general practitioners","years","adequate liaison","development of protocols","clinical audits","spread","stockpile antiviral drugs","experience","personal hygiene","phases","world population","unpredictable behaviour","duties","risks","theWHO","global challenge","imminent issue","Majority","prompt","various ways","article"],"language":"en"},

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of infection with enteropathogens and zoonotic Giardia strains in dogs attending dog parks in Northern California and to compare results of fecal flotation procedures performed at a commercial and university parasitology laboratory. ANIMALS: Three\u2010hundred dogs attending 3 regional dog parks in Northern California. METHODS: Prospective study. Fresh fecal specimens were collected from all dogs, scored for consistency, and owners completed a questionnaire. Specimens were analyzed by fecal centrifugation flotation, DFA, and PCR for detection of 11 enteropathogens. Giardia genotyping was performed for assemblage determination. RESULTS: Enteropathogens were detected in 114/300 dogs (38%), of which 62 (54%) did not have diarrhea. Frequency of dog park attendance correlated significantly with fecal consistency (P = .0039), but did not correlate with enteropathogen detection. Twenty\u2010seven dogs (9%) were infected with Giardia, and genotyping revealed nonzoonotic assemblages C and D. The frequency of Giardia detection on fecal flotation was significantly lower at the commercial laboratory versus the university laboratory (P = .013), and PCR for Giardia was negative in 11/27 dogs (41%) that were positive on fecal flotation or DFA. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Enteropathogens were commonly detected in dogs frequenting dog parks, and infection with Giardia correlated with fecal consistency. PCR detection of Giardia had limited diagnostic utility, and detection of Giardia cysts by microscopic technique can vary among laboratories.","publish_time":"2016-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hascall, K.L.; Kass, P.H.; Saksen, J.; Ahlmann, A.; Scorza, A.V.; Lappin, M.R.; Marks, S.L.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d6951136eb1f783092f894b3d7c98e896cf3e921.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5115183.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27859745/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.14603","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DFA"],"locations":["Northern California"],"keyphrases":["infected dogs","PCR detection of Giardia","frequency of Giardia detection","fecal consistency","Giardia genotyping","Enteropathogens","detection of Giardia cysts","fecal centrifugation flotation","zoonotic Giardia strains","results of fecal flotation procedures","regional dog parks","Fresh fecal specimens","enteropathogen detection","risk factors of infection","commercial laboratory","university laboratory","Frequency of dog park attendance","Northern California","potential zoonotic risk","prevalence","DFA","university parasitology laboratory","owners","diagnostic utility","microscopic technique","revealed nonzoonotic assemblages C","CONCLUSIONS","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","BACKGROUND","assemblage determination","METHODS","Prospective study","laboratories","OBJECTIVES","questionnaire","HYPOTHESIS","ANIMALS","diarrhea"],"language":"en"},

Design A prospective observational study. Setting A medical center in Taiwan. Participants Two hundred thirty HCWs. Intervention NPS examination for the presence of SARS-CoV by two nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Measurements and results During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), NPS polymerase chain reaction screening of HCWs for SARS-CoV was performed. SARS-CoV was examined by two nested RT-PCRs and a quantitative RT-PCR. Serum-specific antibodies were assessed by enzyme immunoassay and indirect immunofluorescence. We monitored 230 HCWs, including 217 first-line HCWs and 13 non\u2013first-line HCWs. One hundred ninety first-line HCWs and 13 non\u2013first-line HCWs had negative results in both nested RT-PCR assays. Two first-line HCWs who were positive on both nested RT-PCR assays had SARS. They had 16,900 \u00B1 7,920 copies (mean \u00B1 SD) of RNA per milliliter in the NPS and had detectable anti-SARS antibodies. The remaining 25 first-line HCWs were negative for the first nested RT-PCR but positive for the second nested RT-PCR. Their corresponding titers were 338 \u00B1 227 copies of RNA per milliliter; antibodies developed in none of these 25 HCWs. The expression and function of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 were not different among these HCWs. This study shows that colonization of SARS-CoV occurred in 25 of 217 well-protected first-line HCWs on a SARS-associated service, but they remained seronegative. Conclusion With the second RT-PCR assay more sensitive than the first RT-PCR assay, we are able to show that approximately 11.5% of well-protected HCWs exposed to SARS patients or specimens may have colonization without seroconversion. Only those with significant clinical symptoms or disease would have active immunity. Thus, regular NPS screening for nested RT-PCR assays in conjunction with a daily recording of body temperature in all first-line HCWs may provide an effective way of early detection.","publish_time":"2006-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ho, Hsin-Tsung; Chang, Mau-Sun; Wei, Tsai-Yin; Hsieh, Wen-Shyang; Hung, Chia-Chien; Yang, Huei-Mei; Lu, Yen-Ta","journal":"Chest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1567b15f056268a550ea0d0409437f11b1167f3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094471.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215315270; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215315270","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPS","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["line HCWs","nested RT-PCR assays","SARS-CoV","quantitative RT-PCR","well-protected HCWs","nested RT-PCRs","colonization of SARS","SARS patients","presence of SARS","NPS polymerase chain reaction screening of HCWs","SARS-associated service","detectable anti-SARS antibodies","regular NPS screening","nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","Intervention NPS examination","negative results","copies of RNA","milliliter","Study objectives","severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","Serum-specific antibodies","prospective observational study","large-scale preventive screening program","enzyme immunoassay","conjunction","findings","daily recording of body temperature","disease","efficacy","specimens","significant clinical symptoms","effective way of early detection","SD","amplification","active immunity","nasopharyngeal swab","health-care workers","function of angiotensin","indirect immunofluorescence","mean","medical center","Taiwan","expression","corresponding titers","seroconversion","Measurements","Conclusion","Participants"],"language":"en"},

It coincides with the \u2018problem of the veil,\u2019 a bone of contention in Islam/West relationships. More specifically, it will address the question of why the pandemic has changed the proxemics of public spaces and the grammar of \u2018living together.\u2019 For some time\u2014and it is not possible to foresee how much\u2014in many countries people cannot go out, or enter any public places, without wearing a sanitary mask. In short, almost all of us, by obligation or by urgent advice from the public authorities of the various countries, will not live the public sphere with our faces uncovered. The alteration of the social context affecting many Western countries will inevitably involve also the \u2018local\u2019 perception of the Islamic veil and\u2014as a matter of equality\u2014the consistency of the prohibition of wearing it. What will thus become of the ban on wearing it in public places established by some countries such as France and asseverated by the ECHR? If everyone can and will have to go around with their faces covered, why should only Islamic women be discriminated against? Will not the change in boundary conditions produced by Covid-19 also induce Western people to re-categorize the meaning of the veil? And will this re-categorization not directly affect the \u2018fact\u2019 of wearing the veil, that is, its empirical perception? And still, will this psycho-semantic change not show how empirical perceptions are cultural constructs rather than \u2018objective facts,\u2019 as such allegedly independent from the observer\u2019s point of view? Consequentially, will the plurality of perceptions and cultural meanings related to the gesture of covering one\u2019s own face not gain renewed relevance in determining the legitimacy of wearing the veil? The socio-semantic earthquake produced by Covid-19 compels us to rethink this and other issues orbiting around the translation of \u2018facts\u2019 into legal language; furthermore, it highlights the instrumentality of many ideological/partisan and ethnocentric assumptions passed off as objectivity regarding those alleged \u2018facts.\u2019 The essay will attempt to provide an answer to the above questions by proposing a semiotic-legal approach to intercultural conflicts and, indirectly, the pluralism in law.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ricca, Mario","journal":"Int J Semiot Law","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4900757387ce78721a2924e2cbe4a7d314bcf9ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190804.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11196-020-09703-y","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs1MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECHR"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["public places","Islamic veil","public authorities","Covid","public sphere","Western countries","countries people","various countries","proxemics of public spaces","empirical perceptions","Western people","essay","faces","psycho-semantic change","cultural constructs","cultural meanings","legal language","plurality of perceptions","objective facts","Islamic women","re-categorization","semiotic-legal approach","socio-semantic earthquake","intercultural conflicts","bone of contention","partisan","ethnocentric assumptions","secondary implication","translation","objectivity","planetary tragedy","urgent advice","social context","West relationships","matter of equality","renewed relevance","consistency","observer\u2019s point of view","questions","facts\u2019","gesture","legitimacy","pandemic","grammar","boundary conditions","sanitary mask","prohibition","pluralism","instrumentality","obligation","alteration","answer","France","ban","time","law","ECHR","issues","problem"],"language":"en"},

This involves a bridge between innate and adaptive immune systems, wherein antibodies form immune complexes that drive numerous innate immune effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis, and antibody-dependent phagocytosis. Here, we review certain mechanisms that modulate these antibody-mediated effector functions against virally infected cells, such as viral glycoprotein shedding, viral glycoprotein internalization, antibody cooperativity, and antibody glycosylation. These mechanisms can either protect viral replication or enhance infected cell clearance.

We aimed to investigate efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of NPI in households with influenza index patients. METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial during the pandemic season 2009/10 and the ensuing influenza season 2010/11. We included households with an influenza positive index case in the absence of further respiratory illness within the preceding 14 days. Study arms were wearing a facemask and practicing intensified hand hygiene (MH group), wearing facemasks only (M group) and none of the two (control group). Main outcome measure was laboratory confirmed influenza infection in a household contact. We used daily questionnaires to examine adherence and tolerability of the interventions. RESULTS: We recruited 84 households (30 control, 26 M and 28 MH households) with 82, 69 and 67 household contacts, respectively. In 2009/10 all 41 index cases had a influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection, in 2010/11 24 had an A (H1N1) pdm09 and 20 had a B infection. The total secondary attack rate was 16% (35/218). In intention-to-treat analysis there was no statistically significant effect of the M and MH interventions on secondary infections. When analysing only households where intervention was implemented within 36 h after symptom onset of the index case, secondary infection in the pooled M and MH groups was significantly lower compared to the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI, 0.03-0.92). In a per-protocol analysis odds ratios were significantly reduced among participants of the M group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30, 95% CI, 0.10-0.94). With the exception of MH index cases in 2010/11 adherence was good for adults and children, contacts and index cases. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that household transmission of influenza can be reduced by the use of NPI, such as facemasks and intensified hand hygiene, when implemented early and used diligently. Concerns about acceptability and tolerability of the interventions should not be a reason against their recommendation.

At present there is no effective specific therapy against MERS-CoV. The use of convalescent plasma (CP) has been suggested as a potential therapy based on existing evidence from other viral infections. We aim to study the feasibility of CP therapy as well as its safety and clinical and laboratory effects in critically ill patients with MERS-CoV infection. We will also examine the pharmacokinetics of the MERS-CoV antibody response and viral load over the course of MERS-CoV infection. This study will inform a future randomized controlled trial that will examine the efficacy of CP therapy for MERS-CoV infection. In the CP collection phase, potential donors will be tested by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques for the presence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies. Subjects with anti-MERS-CoV IFA titer of \u22651:160 and no clinical or laboratory evidence of MERS-CoV infection will be screened for eligibility for plasma donation according to standard donation criteria. In the CP therapy phase, 20 consecutive critically ill patients admitted to intensive care unit with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection will be enrolled and each will receive 2 units of CP. Post enrollment, patients will be followed for clinical and laboratory outcomes that include anti-MERS-CoV antibodies and viral load. This protocol was developed collaboratively by King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Infection Control Center Group and the World Health Organization\u2014International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC-WHO) MERS-CoV Working Group. It was approved in June 2014 by the Ministry of the National Guard Health Affairs Institutional Review Board (IRB). A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) was formulated.

After reinfection and after reactivation, no BHV1-specific IgM antibody response was detected. The serum IgA response was only transiently detectable after reinfection and again appeared rapidly after reactivation in most calves. Most calves showed an increase in nasal and ocular IgA titres after reinfection and reactivation; some calves also had IgA antibodies in genital secretions. A salient finding was that after reinfection and reactivation more calves showed a serum IgA response than virus shedding or an increase in serum IgG1 or IgG2 titres. This suggests that the serum IgA response would be the most sensitive indicator to detect BHV1 reinfection and reactivation. No correlation was found between nasal IgA titre at the time of reinfection or corticosteroid treatment and the period of virus shedding, suggesting that nasal IgA does not play a major role in protection against reinfection with BHV1.","publish_time":"1995-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Madic, J.; Magdalena, J.; Quak, J.; van Oirschot, J.

However, unlike in Haldane\u0027s day, considerable support for this scenario exits today: lack of homology between core DNA replication system components in archaea and bacteria, distinct membrane chemistries and enzymes of lipid biosynthesis in archaea and bacteria, spread of several viral hallmark genes among diverse groups of viruses, and the extant archaeal and bacterial chromosomes appear to be shaped by accretion of diverse, smaller replicons. Under the viral model of precellular evolution, the key components of cells originated as components of virus\u2010like entities.

Here we demonstrate that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has a synergistic effect in vitro on SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations compatible with that obtained in human lung.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andreani, Julien; Le Bideau, Marion; Duflot, Isabelle; Jardot, Priscilla; Rolland, Clara; Boxberger, Manon; Wurtz, Nathalie; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Colson, Philippe; La Scola, Bernard; Raoult, Didier","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f10fb3e6775c6d03da6e4ab0065c6fbceaacab0.json; document_parses/pdf_json/aa942370307672dd0c2013494e35b610a8d68411.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7182748.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344177/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104228; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401020305155?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401020305155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["azithromycin","Human coronaviruses SARS-CoV","synergistic effect","antiviral effect","human lung","combination of hydroxychloroquine","short-term strategy","millions of infected patients","drug repurposing","low costs","concentrations compatible","effective drugs","pandemic","high morbidity","mortality","preliminary clinical trial","efficacy","end"],"language":"en"},

The mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor, MAVS (IPS-1, VISA or Cardif) is critical for host defenses to viral infection by inducing type-1 interferons (IFN-I), however its role in virus-induced apoptotic responses has not been elucidated. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that MAVS causes apoptosis independent of its function in initiating IFN-I production. MAVS-induced cell death requires mitochondrial localization, is caspase dependent, and displays hallmarks of apoptosis. Furthermore, MAVS(\u2212/\u2212) fibroblasts are resistant to Sendai virus-induced apoptosis. A functional screen identifies the hepatitis C virus NS3/4A and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural protein (NSP15) as inhibitors of MAVS-induced apoptosis, possibly as a method of immune evasion. SIGNIFICANCE: This study describes a novel role for MAVS in controlling viral infections through the induction of apoptosis, and identifies viral proteins which inhibit this host response.","publish_time":"2009-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Yu; Moore, Chris B.; Liesman, Rachael M.; O\u0027Connor, Brian P.; Bergstralh, Daniel T.; Chen, Zhijian J.; Pickles, Raymond J.; Ting, Jenny P.-Y.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1560867701aecc60f73407501a5c5c85e53c8522.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2674933.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0005466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19404494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MAVS","VISA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibitors of MAVS","MAVS-induced cell death","Sendai virus-induced apoptosis","apoptosis independent","induction of apoptosis","hallmarks of apoptosis","viral infections","viral proteins","Host responses","host defenses","programmed cell death","mitochondrial localization","immune activation","hepatitis C virus NS3","mitochondrial antiviral","novel role","initiating IFN","apoptotic responses","method of immune evasion","SARS-CoV","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","nonstructural protein","Cardif","IPS","NSP15","caspase dependent","type","functional screen","VISA","study","adaptor","fibroblasts","BACKGROUND","production","interferons","SIGNIFICANCE","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

This technology allows us to develop novel candidate vaccines. In particular, a variety of different attenuation strategies to produce a range of attenuated mononegavirus vaccines have been studied. In addition, because of their ideal nature as live vaccines, recombinant mononegaviruses expressing foreign proteins have also been produced with the aim of developing multivalent vaccines against more than one pathogen. These recombinant mononegaviruses are currently under evaluation as new viral vectors for vaccination.

All IFIT proteins contain multiple TPR motifs which mediate protein-protein interactions. Some, but not all, members inhibit initiation of protein synthesis by binding to the translation initiation factor eIF-3 or by binding to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA. The murine Ifit1 encodes P56, Ifit2 encodes P54 and Ifit3 encodes P49. For investigating the biological functions of the murine Ifit proteins, we have recently generated several knock-out mice. Challenging Ifit1-/- and Ifit2-/- mice with various viruses have revealed their strong, but selective, antiviral properties. Ifit1-mediated host restriction was shown to be evaded by 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral mRNAs. Flavivirus (West Nile Virus), vaccinia virus and coronavirus mutants, that lack 2\u2032-O-methylation of their mRNAs, were growth-restricted in Wt, but not in Ifit1-/-, cells and mice. Further studies revealed that the action of Ifit1 on WNV replication is highly manifested in CNS infection, a deficiency of Ifit1 causing increased neuronal death in infected mice. Ifit2, on the other hand, blocked neuro-pathogenesis caused by intranasal infection with the rhabdovirus, VSV. All Ifit proteins were induced in the CNS of the infected mice, but Ifit1-/- mice were not more susceptible than Wt mice and most of the infected mice survived. In contrast, all Ifit2-/- mice died from neuro-pathogenesis; VSV replicated efficiently in the neurons of these mice. However, there was no effect on pathogenesis by another neuro-tropic virus, EMCV. Moreover, VSV did not replicate efficiently in the liver or the lung of infected Ifit2-/- mice and in vitro, in MEF or primary fetal neurons, the sensitivity of VSV replication to IFN-treatment was similar in Wt and Ifit2-/- cells. These results demonstrated the existence of tissue-, virus- and ISG-specific antiviral actions of interferon.","publish_time":"2012-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sen, G.","journal":"Cytokine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466612005546; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466612005546","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs3NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Volker Fensterl","Jamie Wetzel"],"organizations":["IFIT","TPR","CNS","VSV","EMCV","MEF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected mice","Wt mice","murine Ifit1","deficiency of Ifit1","action of Ifit1","Challenging Ifit1","murine Ifit proteins","lung of infected Ifit2","IFIT genes","interferon-inducible IFIT proteins Ganes Sen","neuro-tropic virus","vaccinia virus","Ifit1-mediated host restriction","protein-protein interactions","sensitivity of VSV replication","blocked neuro-pathogenesis","inducible genes","West Nile Virus","binding","CNS infection","initiation of protein synthesis","ISG-specific antiviral actions of interferon","antiviral properties","members","O-methylation","cells","multi-member family of interferon","WNV replication","intranasal infection","viral mRNAs","primary fetal neurons","translation initiation factor eIF","Volker Fensterl","Jamie Wetzel","ISG56","IFN-treatment","multiple TPR motifs","increased neuronal death","lack","P54","P56","coronavirus mutants","Ifit3","MEF","biological functions","hand","existence of tissue","various viruses","Flavivirus","P49","rhabdovirus","EMCV","growth","liver","results","human","mouse","end","studies","effect","contrast","knock"],"language":"en"},

Pediatric inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are clinically heterogeneous with respect to their mode of presentation, clinical severity, rate of progression, and prognosis. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the CNS, typically transitory and self-limiting. The highest incidence of ADEM is observed during childhood. It is characterized by an acute encephalopathy with polyfocal neurological deficits. In the absence of specific biological markers the diagnosis of ADEM is still based on clinical features and MRI evidence of widespread demyelination, after ruling out other possible explanations for an acute encephalopathy. Over the past decade, many retrospective patient studies have focused on clinical and neuroimaging features, in an attempt to define specific diagnostic criteria. The occurrence of relapses in children with ADEM poses diagnostic difficulties in its differentiation from multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO).

We tried to find some useful information by analyzing the covid-19 screening data, so as to provide help for clinical practice. METHOD: We collected nucleic acid and hematology data from 2510 patients for COVID-19 infection for retrospective analysis. RESULT: COVID-19 and influenza A and B infection rates were 1.3%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. COVID-19 nucleic acid was detected in stool but not in tear samples from 8 positive patients. Among the 32 patients with COVID-19, 15 (47%) and 16 (50%) patients showed decreased lymphocyte count and lymphocyte ratio, 21(66%) and 24(75%) patients showed decreased eosinophil count and eosinophil ratio, and 18 (56%) patients showed increased C-reactive protein. Ten hematological indicators significantly differed in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and those with influenza A and B (P \u003C 0.05). Eighteen hematological indicators significantly differed between patients with COVID-19 and negative patients (P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION: The positive rate of influenza A and B infection was higher than that of COVID-19. When pharyngeal swab collection may cause infection, fecal samples can be examined. Evaluation of pharyngeal swab and fecal samples can improve the positive rate of nucleic acid detection. The COVID-19 can cause some hematological indices changes.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yun, Hu; Sun, Zhuoran; Wu, Jun; Tang, Aiguo; Hu, Min; Xiang, Zhongyuan","journal":"Clin Chim Acta","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b20b38021c2146702206314c19301a06a028b202.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166029.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000989812030173X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000989812030173X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32315614/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.018","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs4NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","positive patients","blood of patients","negative patients","positive rate of influenza","B infection rates","positive rate of nucleic acid detection","fecal samples","hematological indicators","decreased lymphocyte count","decreased eosinophil count","lymphocyte ratio","eosinophil ratio","tear samples","pharyngeal swab collection","Evaluation of pharyngeal swab","hematological indices changes","hematology data","early detection","screening data","isolation","increased C-reactive protein","stool","help","treatment","BACKGROUND","Novel coronavirus","CONCLUSION","retrospective analysis","clinical practice","useful information","METHOD","RESULT"],"language":"en"},

This chapter discusses the epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatments of KD. The etiology still remains unknown, although epidemiological and clinical features strongly suggest an infectious cause. Immunological abnormalities in the acute phase of the disease reflect activation of immune system and marked production of cytokines by activated cells. KD has some similarities to toxin-mediated diseases, both from a clinical and an immunological point of view. The role of one or more superantigens competent of stimulating large numbers of T cells produced by certain strains of Staphylococcus or Streptococcus is discussed in the chapter, in the context of the etiology of KD. Atypical cases are those with fever, acute surgical symptoms, or neurological manifestations as presenting signs. Medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests including elevated white-blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and low hemoglobin, sodium and albumin levels may help to rule out illnesses mimicking KD.

The PAG-IEM method specifically identified BCV particles and possible subviral particles in feces and nasal-swab fluids from infected calves. The PAG-IEM method did not label other enveloped enteric viruses or morphologically similar fringed particles commonly found in feces. Detection of BCV using PAG-IEM was compared with ELISA and direct immunofluorescence (IF) of nasal epithelial cells by monitoring fecal and respiratory tract shedding of BCV from two experimentally infected and two naturally infected calves from birth to 3 weeks of age. PAG-IEM and ELISA detected shedding of BCV in fecal ( 4 4 animals) and nasal ( 3 4 animals) samples for an average of 5.25 days each.

Among the molecular diagnostic methods that have been developed to date, most are in tandem monoplex assays targeting either different regions of a single viral gene segment or different viral gene segments. We describe a dual-gene (duplex) quantitative real-time RT-PCR method selectively targeting pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009. The assay design includes a primer-probe set specific to only the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of this novel influenza A variant and a second set capable of detecting the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of all swine-origin influenza A virus. In silico analysis of the specific HA oligonucleotide sequence used in the assay showed that it targeted only the swine-origin pandemic strain; there was also no cross-reactivity against a wide spectrum of noninfluenza respiratory viruses. The assay has a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 97.7% and 100%, respectively, a lower detection limit of 50 viral gene copies/PCR, and can be adapted to either a qualitative or quantitative mode.

This study is a collection of clinical data from 54 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Zhongfa Xincheng district of China at Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 28, 2020 to February 11, 2020. The average age of the patients was 61.8 \u00B1 14.5 years, and the predominant age group was 50\u201379. The proportion of critical-type patients with comorbidities was higher than that of severe-type patients. Lymphocyte counts were significantly reduced in routine bloodwork for all patients, but significantly lower in critical-type patients than that in severe-type patients. Prolongation of prothrombin times (PT) and elevation of fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) and D-dimers (D-Ds) were detected in coagulation function tests, and more significant changes were observed in critical-type patients compared to severe-type patients. Serum ferritin levels were sensitive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection but could not be used for disease assessment. In addition, levels of two inflammatory factors, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly increased in all patients, but higher in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients. Moreover, kidney injury was the second-most common organ affected by COVID-19 followed by heart and liver. Kidney and heart injury were more severe in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients. All of the 31 severe-type patients recovered. Of the critical-type patients, six died and 17 recovered. The length of hospital stay for critical-type patients was significantly longer for severe-type patients. In summary, increased lymphocyte counts, prolonged PT, secondary increases in fibrinolytic activity and increases in sIL-2R and IL-6 are typical features of COVID-19 and are associated with disease severity.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Yanlei; Hu, Yanbing; Yu, Jinyan; Ma, Tiangang","journal":"Lab Invest","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/abdfbaa000a674b8344277f052efc65db0ae3769.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7184820.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341519/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41374-020-0431-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Zhongfa Xincheng","China"],"keyphrases":["severe-type patients","critical-type patients","hospitalized adult patients","proportion of critical","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","sIL","increased lymphocyte counts","typical features of COVID","heart injury","kidney injury","prolonged PT","D-Ds","soluble interleukin","D-dimers","secondary increases","length of hospital","clinical diagnosis","average age","disease assessment","disease severity","novel coronavirus pneumonia","Serum ferritin levels","collection of clinical data","predominant age group","Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science","FDPs","elevation of fibrinogen degradation products","Zhongfa Xincheng district of China","laboratory characteristics","inflammatory factors","fibrinolytic activity","SARS-CoV","receptor","significant changes","comorbidities","coagulation function tests","summary","years","Prolongation of prothrombin times","routine bloodwork","Timely analysis","Technology","study","addition","common organ","infection","prognosis","liver"],"language":"en"},

Of 22 persons, all washed hands after handling camels, 82% wore gumboots, and 65% wore overalls/dustcoats. None of the workers wore gloves or facemasks during slaughter processes. Fourteen percent reported drinking raw camel milk; 90% were aware of zoonotic diseases with most reporting common ways of transmission as: eating improperly cooked meat (90%), drinking raw milk (68%) and slaughter processes (50%). Sixteen (73%) were unaware of MERS\u2010CoV. Use of personal protective clothing to prevent direct contact with discharges and aerosols was lacking. Although few people working with camels were interviewed, those met at this centralized slaughterhouse lacked knowledge about MERS\u2010CoV but were aware of zoonotic diseases and their transmission.

The antifungal mechanism of action of both AMPs is closely linked to - but not solely dependent on - the lipid composition of the fungal cell membrane and requires a strictly regulated protein uptake into the cell, indicating that PAF and PAFB are not canonical membrane active proteins. Variations in their antifungal spectrum and their killing dynamics point towards a divergent mode of action related to their physicochemical properties and surface charge distribution. In this review, we relate characteristic features of PAF and PAFB to the current knowledge about other AMPs of different sources. In addition, we present original data that have never been published before to substantiate our assumptions and provide evidences that help to explain and understand better the mechanistic function of PAF and PAFB. Finally, we underline the promising potential of PAF and PAFB as future antifungal therapeutics.","publish_time":"2020-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huber, A.; Galgoczy, L.; Varadi, G.; Holzknecht, J.; Kakar, A.; Malanovic, N.; Leber, R.; Koch, J.; Keller, M.

In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we evaluated the association between IL28B SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 and the clinical outcome of bronchiolitis in pediatric patients. METHODS: A total of 682 infants suffering from bronchiolitis, categorized based on the final clinical outcome as mild or severe, were genotyped for IL28B SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917. RESULTS: When infants were categorized exclusively based on the final clinical outcome, no association was established between IL28B SNPs and the severity of bronchiolitis. However, when stratified by sex, the homozygotes for the minor alleles of rs12979860 (T) and rs8099917 (G) were associated with a mild disease in girls but not in boys. CONCLUSION: SNPs rs12979860 and rs8099917 correlate with the severity of bronchiolitis and display a sex bias, where GG rs8099917 and TT rs12979860 genotypes are associated with a mild disease in girls but not in boys.

Therefore, the aim of the study was to gain a better insight into the development dynamics of certain bacterial groups during the first week of life. METHODS AND RESULTS: Faecal samples of healthy Simmental calves (dual\u2010purpose breed; n = 80), bottle fed and raised in a dairy farm were taken immediately after birth and at 6/12/24/48/72/168 h (h) after birth. Samples were analysed using cultural, biochemical and molecular\u2013biological methods. The aerobe, anaerobe, Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus counts of healthy calves increased significantly between 6 and 24 h postpartum (P \u003C0\u00B705). Apart from the anaerobes, bacterial counts decreased after reaching a plateau at 24\u201348 h.

Numerous viruses introduce DNA damage and genetic instability in host cells during their lifecycles and some species also manipulate components of the DNA damage response (DDR), a complex and sophisticated series of cellular pathways that have evolved to detect and repair DNA lesions. Activation and manipulation of the DDR by DNA viruses has been extensively studied. It is apparent, however, that many RNA viruses can also induce significant DNA damage, even in cases where viral replication takes place exclusively in the cytoplasm. DNA damage can contribute to the pathogenesis of RNA viruses through the triggering of apoptosis, stimulation of inflammatory immune responses and the introduction of deleterious mutations that can increase the risk of tumorigenesis. In addition, activation of DDR pathways can contribute positively to replication of viral RNA genomes. Elucidation of the interactions between RNA viruses and the DDR has provided important insights into modulation of host cell functions by these pathogens. This review summarises the current literature regarding activation and manipulation of the DDR by several medically important RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2016-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ryan, Ellis L.; Hollingworth, Robert; Grand, Roger J.","journal":"Biomolecules","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca52af941437873b4122bb2e26d7e3fab81cd73f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4808796.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26751489/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom6010002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DDR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA viruses","important RNA viruses","pathogenesis of RNA viruses","Numerous viruses","DNA damage response","significant DNA damage","activation of DDR pathways","replication of viral RNA genomes","repair DNA lesions","viral replication","manipulation","host cells","important insights","diverse group of pathogens","modulation of host cell functions","sophisticated series of cellular pathways","genetic instability","triggering of apoptosis","stimulation of inflammatory immune responses","cases","lifecycles","components","introduction of deleterious mutations","place","species","current literature","interactions","lethal human diseases","review","addition","Elucidation","risk of tumorigenesis","cytoplasm"],"language":"en"},

Commensal E. coli strains are believed to be the precursor of pathogenic strains by means of acquisition of antimicrobial resistant and virulence genes. Laboratory rodents are inherently susceptible to numerous known infectious agents, which could transfer virulence determinants to commensal E. coli. Hence, in this study, the genetic structure of commensal E. coli found in laboratory rodents and their antimicrobial resistance profiles were investigated. RESULTS: E. coli strains belonging to phylogroup A were the predominant strain obtained from the animals used in the study. Four novel sequence types (ST746, ST747, ST748 and ST749) were discovered using the multi locus sequence typing, together with one common ST357 in the gastrointestinal tract, liver and, the trachea and lung. Serotyping demonstrated that these commensal E. coli strains were non-Shiga toxin-producers. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of extended spectrum beta lactamases were also negative. CONCLUSIONS: These findings implied that the E. coli strains recovered from the laboratory rodents were truly commensal in nature. Further study is required to investigate the possible influence of gender on the susceptibility of hosts to E. coli colonization in laboratory rodents.

We developed a single-tube sample preparation approach involving direct pathogen enrichment and extraction from human specimens using diatomaceous earth (DE). Amine-modified DE was used to directly enrich a zoonotic pathogen, Brucella, in a large sample volume. Next, a complex of amine-modified DE and dimethyl suberimidate was used for nucleic acid extraction from the enriched pathogen. Using our single-tube approach, the pathogen can be enriched and extracted within 60 min at a level of 1 colony formation unit (CFU) from a 1 ml sample volume in the same tube. The performance of this approach is 10\u2013100 times better than that of a commercial kit (10(2) to 10(3) CFU/ml) but does not require a large centrifuge. Finally, we combined the single-tube approach with a bio-optical sensor for rapid and accurate zoonotic pathogen detection in human urine samples. Using the combination system, Brucella in human urine can be efficiently enriched (~ 8-fold) and the detection limit is enhanced by up to 100 times (1 CFU/ml bacteria in urine) compared with the commercial kit. This combined system is fast and highly sensitive and thus represents a promising approach for disease diagnosis in the clinical setting.","publish_time":"2018-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Fei; Koo, Bonhan; Liu, Huifang; Eun Jin, Choong; Shin, Yong","journal":"Biosens Bioelectron","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127695.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28818785/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.08.027; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566317305614; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566317305614","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["single-tube sample preparation approach","single-tube approach","enriched pathogen","efficient sample preparation","promising approach","large sample volume","CFU","current sample preparation assays","accurate zoonotic pathogen detection","direct pathogen enrichment","human urine samples","human specimens","Brucella","Amine-modified","combined system","times","commercial kit","detection limit","combination system","complex of amine","large centrifuge","nucleic acid extraction","zoonoses","bio-optical sensor","point","dimethyl suberimidate","disease diagnosis","care testing of emerging diseases","colony formation unit","diatomaceous earth","clinical setting","level","multiple instruments","bacteria","fold","performance"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiology, clinical, and zoonotic impacts of these species are however largely unknown. The study aimed to investigate the presence of Chlamydia spp. in the intestines of growing pigs and in conjunctival swabs from finisher pigs, and relate the findings to clinical signs. RESULTS: By histology, 20 of 48 pigs had intestinal lesions that may be consistent with chlamydial infection. By PCR, forty-six of the pigs were positive whereas two samples were inhibited. Sequencing of 19 DNA extracts identified these as Chlamydia suis. By immunohistochemistry, 32 of 44 samples were positive and a significant relationship was detected between macroscopically visible intestinal lesions and a high degree of infection. By real-time PCR, a significant difference was detected between pigs with and without conjunctivitis when a Ct value of 36 was employed but not when a Ct value of 38 was employed. CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia suis was demonstrated in most samples and overall, no correlation to clinical signs was detected. However, a correlation was noted between samples with a high degree of infection and the presence of clinical signs. It is possible, that the intensive pig production systems studied might predispose for the transmission and maintenance of the infection thus increasing the infectious load and the risk for disease in the pig.","publish_time":"2012-01-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Englund, Stina; H\u00E5rd af Segerstad, Carl; Arnlund, Frida; Westergren, Eva; Jacobson, Magdalena","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88a0b7d6447839c09069588d1761364ce9045d61.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3307427.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-8-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22280482/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["samples","finisher pigs","presence of Chlamydia","Chlamydia suis","presence of clinical signs","high degree of infection","intestines of growing pigs","capable of infecting pigs","genera Chlamydia","chlamydial infection","species","correlation","Ct value","visible intestinal lesions","significant relationship","significant difference","real-time PCR","intensive pig production systems","conjunctival swabs","identification","development of refined diagnostic techniques","risk","disease","infectious load","DNA extracts","zoonotic impacts","findings","transmission","epidemiology","conjunctivitis","Sequencing","maintenance","BACKGROUND","histology","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","study","immunohistochemistry"],"language":"en"},

The core of the designed decision model is the forecasting model that attempts to ex-ante predict the cumulative flock mortality for the period between 8 and 28 d of age. Forecasts were generated with the parameters of the linear regression model where continuous values of daily mortalities served as a dependent variable. The decision variable is a binary (yes/no) choice variable, where \u201Cyes\u201D means \u201Cgo ahead with treatment\u201D and \u201Cno\u201D means \u201Cdo nothing\u201D.

The results indicate a reasonable accuracy of the prediction model where the number of correct prediction increases and the number of incorrect predictions falls very fast as the forecasting window shortens.

Low moisture content in cabins is known to be responsible for headache, tiredness and many other non-specific symptoms. In addition, current widely used air distribution systems on airplanes dilute internally generated pollutants by promoting air mixing and thus impose risks of infectious airborne disease transmission. To boost air humidity level while simultaneously restricting air mixing, this investigation uses a validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program to design a new under-aisle air distribution system for wide-body aircraft cabins. The new system supplies fully outside, dry air at low momentum through a narrow channel passage along both side cabin walls to middle height of the cabin just beneath the stowage bins, while simultaneously humidified air is supplied through both perforated under aisles. By comparing with the current mixing air distribution system in terms of distribution of relative humidity, CO2 concentration, velocity, temperature and draught risk, the new system is found being able to improve the relative humidity from the existent 10% to the new level of 20% and lessen the inhaled CO2 concentration by 30%, without causing moisture condensation on cabin interior and inducing draught risks for passengers. The water consumption rate in air humidification is only around 0.05kg/h per person, which should be affordable by airliners.","publish_time":"2010-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Tengfei; Yin, Shi; Wang, Shugang","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86d97117c82af69de428326b86837eee594b9399.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126907.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288009/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2009.09.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132309002534; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132309002534","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Abstract Air"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["air mixing","dry air","air humidification","humidified air","air distribution systems","air humidity level","current mixing air distribution system","Abstract Air environment","new under-aisle air distribution system","new system","new level","terms of distribution","relative humidity","cabin walls","cabin interior","draught risks","wide-body aircraft cabins","inhaled CO2 concentration","Low moisture content","low momentum","moisture condensation","risks of infectious airborne disease transmission","program","velocity","validated computational fluid dynamics","CFD","narrow channel passage","investigation","temperature","generated pollutants","airplanes","tiredness","water consumption rate","middle height","stowage bins","existent","headache","passengers","addition","non-specific symptoms","person","airliners","dryness","aisles"],"language":"en"},

Since then, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported in more than 180 countries with approximately 3 million known infections and more than 210,000 deaths attributed to this disease. The majority of confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported in adults, especially older individuals with co-morbidities. Children have had a relatively lower rate and a less serious course of infection as reported in the literature to date. One of the most vulnerable pediatric patient populations is cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit. There is limited data on the effect of COVID-19 in fetal life, and among neonates after birth. Therefore there is an urgent need for proactive preparation, and planning to combat COVID-19, as well as to safeguard patients, their families, and healthcare personnel. This review article is based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u0027s (CDC) current recommendations for COVID-19 and its adaptation to our local resources. The aim of this article is to provide basic consolidated guidance and checklists to clinicians in the neonatal intensive care units in key aspects of preparation needed to counter exposure or infection with COVID-19. We anticipate that CDC will continue to update their guidelines regarding COVID-19 as the situation evolves, and we recommend monitoring CDC\u0027s updates for the most current information.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verma, Sourabh; Lumba, Rishi; Lighter, Jennifer L.; Bailey, Sean M.; Wachtel, Elena V.; Kunjumon, Bgee; Alessi, Samantha; Mally, Pradeep V.","journal":"Curr Probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/427ed7fbfbf1a9f6b611bc4f3770e5abe8d8e249.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7221379.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1538544220300559?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32410913/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1538544220300559; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cppeds.2020.100795","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDC"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["effect of COVID","Coronavirus Disease","majority of confirmed COVID","Disease Control","neonatal intensive care units","novel pathogenic coronavirus","proactive preparation","current recommendations","cluster of cases","current information","review article","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","key aspects of preparation","serious course of infection","clinicians","checklists","Prevention\u0027s","basic consolidated guidance","Centers","pneumonia","families","lower rate","older individuals","adults","SARS-CoV2","fetal life","exposure","co-morbidities","vulnerable pediatric patient populations","known infections","neonates","CDC\u0027s updates","urgent need","deaths","adaptation","limited data","safeguard patients","healthcare personnel","local resources","countries","birth","Children","literature","China","guidelines","aim","situation"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential use of infrared thermography (IRT) for early detection of fever in sheep experimentally infected with bluetongue virus serotype 1 (BTV-1) and serotype 8 (BTV-8). This would reduce animal stress during experimental assays and assist in the development of a screening method for the identification of fever in animals suspected of being infected with BTV. Rectal and infrared eye temperatures were collected before and after BTV inoculation. The two temperature measures were positively correlated (r =0.504, P \u003C0.05). The highest correlation between rectal and infrared temperatures was observed when temperatures were above physiological levels. IRT discriminated between febrile and non-febrile sheep with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 97%. The results showed that eye temperature measured using IRT was a useful non-invasive method for the assessment of fever in sheep infected with BTV under experimental conditions. Further research is required to evaluate the use of IRT under field conditions to identify potentially infected animals in bluetongue surveillance programmes.","publish_time":"2013-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"P\u00E9rez de Diego, Ana C.; S\u00E1nchez-Cord\u00F3n, Pedro J.; Pedrera, Miriam; Mart\u00EDnez-L\u00F3pez, Beatriz; G\u00F3mez-Villamandos, Jos\u00E9 C.; S\u00E1nchez-Vizca\u00EDno, Jos\u00E9 M.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d55579da23b39930f789c6a961c517d9fe71d3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110885.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24053993/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023313003365; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.07.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023313003365","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BTV","IRT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BTV inoculation","infected animals","use of IRT","infrared temperatures","infrared eye temperatures","assessment of fever","identification of fever","Abstract Fever","non-febrile sheep","bluetongue virus serotype","early detection of fever","experimental conditions","potential use of infrared thermography","bluetongue surveillance programmes","screening method","field conditions","experimental assays","temperature measures","useful non-invasive method","earliest clinical sign","development","sensitivity","highest correlation","animal stress","study","physiological levels","results","aim","specificity","research","viraemia"],"language":"en"},

We will also discuss the double-edged effect of STAT3 activation in the muscles, including the role of STAT3 signaling in muscle hypertrophy induced by exercise training or muscle wasting in cachectic diseases and muscular dystrophies. STAT3 is a critical regulator of satellite cell self-renewal after muscle injury. STAT3 knock out affects satellite cell myogenic progression by impairing proliferation and inducing premature differentiation. Recent studies in STAT3 signaling demonstrated its direct role in controlling myogenic capacity of myoblasts and satellite cells, as well as the potential benefit in using STAT3 inhibitors to treat muscle diseases. However, prolonged STAT3 activation in muscles has been shown to be responsible for muscle wasting by activating protein degradation pathways. It is important to balance the extent of STAT3 activation and the duration and location (cell types) of the STAT3 signaling when developing therapeutic interventions. STAT3 signaling in other tissues and organs that can directly or indirectly affects skeletal muscle health are also discussed.","publish_time":"2018-08-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guadagnin, Eleonora; M\u00E1zala, Davi; Chen, Yi-Wen","journal":"Int J Mol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f8a1700ee536e43e65c9ba4df7f87b0461ee999.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6121875.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30072615/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19082265","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of STAT3","STAT3 inhibitors","extent of STAT3 activation","prolonged STAT3 activation","muscle diseases","upstream activators of STAT3","double-edged effect of STAT3 activation","muscle hypertrophy","muscle injury","skeletal muscle mass","skeletal muscle health","skeletal muscles","satellite cell myogenic progression","satellite cells","cell types","cachectic diseases","critical regulator of satellite cell self-renewal","direct role","plays critical roles","myogenic capacity of myoblasts","impairing proliferation","duration","exercise training","IL6","location","growth factor beta","activator of transcription","focus","repair","TGF-\u03B21","premature differentiation","muscular dystrophies","potential benefit","protein degradation pathways","Signal transducer","interleukin","Recent studies","review","therapeutic interventions","tissues","organs"],"language":"en"},

We offer our outlook on challenges and opportunities facing the field, including the integration of novel molecular and digital information sources into disease surveillance, the assimilation of such data into models of pathogen spread, and the increasing contribution of models to public health practice. We next consider emerging paradigms in causal inference for infectious diseases, ranging from approaches to evaluating vaccines and antimicrobial therapies to the task of ascribing clinical syndromes to etiologic microorganisms, an age-old problem transformed by our increasing ability to characterize human-associated microbiota.

Brazil will host the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games, events that are expected to attract hundreds of thousands of international travelers. Travelers to Brazil will encounter locally endemic infections as well as mass event\u2013specific risks. Methods. We describe 1586 ill returned travelers who had visited Brazil and were seen at a GeoSentinel Clinic from July 1997 through May 2013. Results. The most common travel-related illnesses were dermatologic conditions (40%), diarrheal syndromes (25%), and febrile systemic illness (19%). The most common specific dermatologic diagnoses were cutaneous larva migrans, myiasis, and tungiasis. Dengue and malaria, predominantly Plasmodium vivax, were the most frequently identified specific causes of fever and the most common reasons for hospitalization after travel. Dengue fever diagnoses displayed marked seasonality, although cases were seen throughout the year. Among the 28 ill returned travelers with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 11 had newly diagnosed asymptomatic infection and 9 had acute symptomatic HIV. Conclusions. Our analysis primarily identified infectious diseases among travelers to Brazil. Knowledge of illness in travelers returning from Brazil can assist clinicians to advise prospective travelers and guide pretravel preparation, including itinerary-tailored advice, vaccines, and chemoprophylaxis; it can also help to focus posttravel evaluation of ill returned travelers. Travelers planning to attend mass events will encounter other risks that are not captured in our surveillance network.","publish_time":"2014-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wilson, Mary E.; Chen, Lin H.; Han, Pauline V.; Keystone, Jay S.; Cramer, Jakob P.; Segurado, Aluisio; Hale, DeVon; Jensenius, Mogens; Schwartz, Eli; von Sonnenburg, Frank; Leder, Karin","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/024ae21d4bebe8ca31c12439a488a0f4e5204193.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112384.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciu122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585698/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Travelers"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["prospective travelers","international travelers","Brazil","posttravel evaluation of ill returned travelers","common specific dermatologic diagnoses","specific risks","Dengue fever diagnoses","common reasons","mass events","specific causes of fever","common travel-related illnesses","dermatologic conditions","Knowledge of illness","diagnosed asymptomatic infection","acute symptomatic HIV","febrile systemic illness","cutaneous larva migrans","human immunodeficiency virus","guide pretravel preparation","itinerary-tailored advice","myiasis","marked seasonality","clinicians","endemic infections","vaccines","cases","FIFA World Cup","infectious diseases","Paralympic Games","hundreds of thousands","chemoprophylaxis","tungiasis","malaria","Plasmodium vivax","hospitalization","analysis","diarrheal syndromes","GeoSentinel Clinic","surveillance network","year","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Some of these TLR4 polymorphisms are racially specific. We hypothesised that feline TLR4 polymorphisms might underlie an observed increased risk to infectious and inflammatory diseases in some cat breeds. The aim of this study was to identify breed-specific variations in the coding region of feline TLR4 and to model the effect of mutations on protein structure and function in silico. The entire coding region of TLR4 was sequenced in 8 groups (7 pure-bred, 1 crossbred) of domestic cats (Felis catus) comprising 158 individuals. Twenty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in TLR4, with 16 located in the coding region (11 non-synonymous) and four in the 3\u2032UTR. Comparison of breed specific allelic frequencies indicated that Burmese and British shorthairs most commonly differed from other breeds. In silico analyses to predict the impact of the 11 non-synonymous variants indicated a deleterious effect on protein structure for one SNP (c.869 G \u003E A), which was not associated with a specific breed.

In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge of animal models of MERS-CoV infection. Commonly used laboratory animal species such as Syrian hamsters, mice and ferrets are not susceptible to MERS-CoV, due to differences in the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). The initially developed animal models comprise two nonhuman primate species, the rhesus macaque and the common marmoset. Rhesus macaques develop a mild to moderate respiratory disease upon inoculation, reminiscent of milder MERS cases, whereas marmosets develop a moderate to severe respiratory disease, recapitulating the severe disease observed in some patients. Dromedary camels, considered to be the reservoir for MERS-CoV, develop a mild upper respiratory tract infection with abundant viral shedding. Although normal mice are not susceptible to MERS-CoV, expression of the human DPP4 (hDPP4) overcomes the lack of susceptibility. Transgenic hDPP4 mice develop severe and lethal respiratory disease upon inoculation with MERS-CoV. These hDPP4 transgenic mice are potentially the ideal first line animal model for efficacy testing of therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures. Further characterization of identified countermeasures would ideally be performed in the common marmoset model, due to the more severe disease outcome.

A serum neutralization test was developed for measuring NiV neutralizing antibodies under BSL2 conditions using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and bearing the F and G proteins of NiV (VSV\u2013NiV\u2013GFP). The neutralization titers were obtained by counting GFP-expressing cells or by measuring fluorescence.

Many of these engineered viruses are viable and express heterologous proteins at high levels, but the inserted sequences often prove to be unstable over time and are rapidly lost, limiting heterologous protein expression. Although virologists are aware that inserted sequences can be unstable, processes leading to insert instability are rarely considered from an evolutionary perspective. Here, we review experimental work on the stability of inserted sequences over a broad range of viruses, and we present some theoretical considerations concerning insert stability. Different virus genome organizations strongly impact insert stability, and factors such as the position of insertion can have a strong effect. In addition, we argue that insert stability not only depends on the characteristics of a particular genome, but that it will also depend on the host environment and the demography of a virus population. The interplay between all factors affecting stability is complex, which makes it challenging to develop a general model to predict the stability of genomic insertions. We highlight key questions and future directions, finding that insert stability is a surprisingly complex problem and that there is need for mechanism-based, predictive models. Combining theoretical models with experimental tests for stability under varying conditions can lead to improved engineering of viral modified genomes, which is a valuable tool for understanding genome evolution as well as for biotechnological applications, such as gene therapy.","publish_time":"2019-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Willemsen, Anouk; Zwart, Mark P","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6e985e472df7bba7a7ef1568336c0443b919639.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6855363.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31741748/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vez045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["insert stability","stability of inserted sequences","stability of genomic insertions","engineered viruses","exogenous sequences","heterologous gene expression","heterologous protein expression","large number of viruses","genome evolution","broad range of viruses","theoretical models","factors","particular genome","Different virus genome organizations","express heterologous proteins","experimental tests","experimental work","gene therapy","theoretical considerations","virus population","predictive models","complex problem","improved engineering of viral modified genomes","cultured cells","high levels","natural hosts","varying conditions","vectors","biotechnological applications","valuable tool","demography","future directions","processes","position of insertion","key questions","instability","virologists","characteristics","strong effect","host environment","general model","mechanism","time","interplay","evolutionary perspective","addition"],"language":"en"},

Unsurprisingly, due to the regulatory role that CD200R1 plays in multiple inflammatory pathways, an increasing number of parasitic, bacterial, and viral pathogens exploit this pathway to suppress host defenses. A complete understanding of the pathways regulated by CD200R1 signaling and the diverse mechanisms that pathogens have evolved to manipulate the CD200:CD200R1 pathway can help identify clinical situations where targeting this interaction can be of therapeutic benefit. In this review, we compare CD200R1 to other pathogen-targeted inhibitory receptors and highlight how this signaling pathway is utilized by a diverse number of pathogens and, therefore, may represent a novel targeting strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vaine, Christine A.; Soberman, Roy J.","journal":"Advances in Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d787fd0d2ef92f3430670b2c19a5102e67fd167.json; document_parses/pdf_json/81af605faf3fcd177c45e82efadb87cf82c02917.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4617684.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-800100-4.00005-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24388216/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128001004000052; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4617684?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128001004000052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD200R1 pathway","CD200R1 inhibitory","diverse number of pathogens","viral pathogens","multiple inflammatory pathways","wide range of inflammatory diseases","regulatory role","prominent role","diverse mechanisms","increasing number of parasitic","treatment of infectious diseases","novel targeting strategy","pathogen-targeted inhibitory receptors","interferons","inducible nitric oxide synthase","tumor necrosis factor","response","expression of proinflammatory molecules","inflammation","selected stimuli","interaction","clinical situations","complete understanding","host defenses","therapeutic benefit","review"],"language":"en"},

An immunosensor for the determination of MERS-CoV is described here. It is based on a competitive assay carried out on an array of carbon electrodes (DEP) modified with gold nanoparticles. Recombinant spike protein S1 was used as a biomarker for MERS CoV. The electrode array enables multiplexed detection of different CoVs. The biosensor is based on indirect competition between free virus in the sample and immobilized MERS-CoV protein for a fixed concentration of antibody added to the sample. Voltammetric response is detected by monitoring the change in the peak current (typically acquired at a working potential of \u22120.05 V vs. Ag/AgCl) after addition of different concentrations of antigen against MERS-CoV. Electrochemical measurements using ferrocyanide/ferricyanide as a probe were recorded using square wave voltammetry (SWV). Good linear response between the sensor response and the concentrations from 0.001 to 100 ng.mL(\u22121) and 0.01 to 10,000 ng.mL(\u22121) were observed for MERS-CoV and HCoV, respectively. The assay was performed in 20 min with detection limit as low as 0.4 and 1.0 pg.mL(\u22121) for HCoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. The method is highly selective over non-specific proteins such as Influenza A and B. The method is single-step, sensitive and accurate. It was successfully applied to spiked nasal samples.

Relatively recently, the technical ability to produce drier material has led to adoption of the practice in Europe under different climatic conditions. This review collates the evidence available on benefits and risks of using RMS bedding on dairy farms, with a European context in mind. There was less evidence than expected for anecdotal claims of improved cow comfort. Among animal health risks, only udder health has received appreciable attention. There are some circumstantial reports of difficulties of maintaining udder health on RMS, but no large scale or long term studies of effects on clinical and subclinical mastitis have been published. Existing reports do not give consistent evidence of inevitable problems, nor is there any information on clinical implications for other diseases. The scientific basis for guidelines on management of RMS bedding is limited. Decisions on optimum treatment and management may present conflicts between controls of different groups of organisms.

Using multiplexed nCounter technology to digitally quantify 600 human mRNAs in parallel with 14 virus- and 5 bacterium-specific RNAs, we characterized viral and bacterial presence in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of 58 children with ARI and determined the corresponding in situ immune profiles. NPA contained different groups of organisms and these were classified into bacterial (n = 27), viral (n = 5), codetection [containing both viral and bacterial transcripts (n = 21), or indeterminate intermediate where microbial load is below threshold (n = 5)]. We then identified differentially expressed immune transcripts (DEITs) comparing NPAs from symptomatic children vs. healthy controls, and comparing children presenting NPAs with detectable microbial load vs. indeterminate. We observed a strong innate immune response in NPAs, due to the presence of evolutionarily conserved type I Interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISG), which was correlated with total bacterial and/or viral load. In comparison with indeterminate NPAs, adaptive immunity transcripts discriminated among viral, bacterial, and codetected microbial profiles. In viral NPAs, B cell transcripts were significantly enriched among DEITs, while only type III IFN was correlated with viral load. In bacterial NPAs, myeloid cells and coinhibitory transcripts were enriched and significantly correlated with bacterial load. In conclusion, digital nCounter transcriptomics provide a microbial and immunological in situ \u201Csnapshot\u201D of the nasopharyngeal interface in children with ARI.

In young pigs, the virus is highly pathogenic and the associated morbidity and mortality has a significant negative impact on the swine industry. We have applied the IDEA model to better understand the 2014 PEDV outbreak in Ontario, Canada. Using our simple, 2-parameter IDEA model, we have evaluated the early epidemic dynamics of PEDV on Ontario swine farms. RESULTS: We estimated the best-fit R(0) and control parameter (d) for the between farm transmission component of the outbreak by fitting the model to publically available cumulative incidence data. We used maximum likelihood to compare model fit estimates for different combinations of the R(0) and d parameters. Using our initial findings from the iterative fitting procedure, we projected the time course of the epidemic using only a subset of the early epidemic data. The IDEA model projections showed excellent agreement with the observed data based on a 7-day generation time estimate. The best-fit estimate for R(0) was 1.87 (95% CI: 1.52 \u2013 2.34) and for the control parameter (d) was 0.059 (95% CI: 0.022 \u2013 0.117). Using data from the first three generations of the outbreak, our iterative fitting procedure suggests that R(0) and d had stabilized sufficiently to project the time course of the outbreak with reasonable accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence and spread of PEDV represents an important agricultural emergency. The virus presents a significant ongoing threat to the Canadian swine industry. Developing an understanding of the important epidemiological characteristics and disease transmission dynamics of a novel pathogen such as PEDV is critical for helping to guide the implementation of effective, efficient, and economically feasible disease control and prevention strategies that are able to help decrease the impact of an outbreak.","publish_time":"2017-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greer, Amy L.; Spence, Kelsey; Gardner, Emma","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e4905089dd52ffd586f780d272e2cd951457196.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5217418.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28056953/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-016-0922-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["United States","Ontario","Canada"],"keyphrases":["PEDV outbreak","parameter IDEA model","early epidemic data","early epidemic dynamics of PEDV","model fit estimates","IDEA model projections","best-fit R","control parameter","Canadian swine industry","observed data","time course","d parameters","Ontario swine farms","iterative fitting procedure","best-fit estimate","United States swine industry","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","disease transmission dynamics","feasible disease control","day generation time estimate","significant negative impact","publically available cumulative incidence data","significant ongoing threat","important epidemiological characteristics","farm transmission component","important agricultural emergency","mortality","novel pathogen","excellent agreement","associated morbidity","prevention strategies","different combinations","BACKGROUND","initial findings","maximum likelihood","subset","reasonable accuracy","implementation of effective","understanding","generations","Canada","young pigs","emergence","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The experiments were conducted in a hospital isolation room with a pressure of \u2212 5 Pa. Airflow was marked with intrapulmonary smoke. The jet nebulizer was driven by air at a constant flow rate of 6 L/min, with the mask reservoir filled with sterile water and attached to the HPS via a nebulizer mask. The exhaled leakage jet plume was revealed by a laser light sheet and images captured by high-definition video. Smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light scattered by smoke and droplet particles. FINDINGS: The maximum dispersion distance of smoke particles through the nebulizer side vent was 0.45 m lateral to the HPS at normal lung condition (oxygen consumption, 200 mL/min; lung compliance, 70 mL/cm H(2)O), but it increased to 0.54 m in mild lung injury (oxygen consumption, 300 mL/min; lung compliance, 35 mL/cm H(2)O), and beyond 0.8 m in severe lung injury (oxygen consumption, 500 mL/min; lung compliance, 10 mL/cm H(2)O). More extensive leakage through the side vents of the nebulizer mask was noted with more severe lung injury.

We also assessed long-term survivors\u2019 health-related quality of life (HRQL), respiratory symptoms, and anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequencies. METHODS: Data from 140 ECMO-treated ARDS patients admitted to three French ICUs (2008\u20132012) were analyzed. ICU survivors contacted \u003E6 months post-ICU discharge were assessed for HRQL, psychological and PTSD status. RESULTS: Main ARDS etiologies were bacterial (45 %), influenza A[H(1)N(1)] (26 %) and post-operative (17 %) pneumonias. Six months post-ICU discharge, 84 (60 %) patients were still alive. Based on multivariable logistic regression analysis, the PRESERVE (PRedicting dEath for SEvere ARDS on VV-ECMO) score (0\u201314 points) was constructed with eight pre-ECMO parameters, i.e. age, body mass index, immunocompromised status, prone positioning, days of mechanical ventilation, sepsis-related organ failure assessment, plateau pressure andpositive end-expiratory pressure. Six-month post-ECMO initiation cumulative probabilities of survival were 97, 79, 54 and 16 % for PRESERVE classes 0\u20132, 3\u20134, 5\u20136 and \u22657 (p \u003C 0.001), respectively. HRQL evaluation in 80 % of the 6-month survivors revealed satisfactory mental health but persistent physical and emotional-related difficulties, with anxiety, depression or PTSD symptoms reported, by 34, 25 or 16 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The PRESERVE score might help ICU physicians select appropriate candidates for ECMO among severe ARDS patients. Future studies should also focus on physical and psychosocial rehabilitation that could lead to improved HRQL in this population.

Setting: Paediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary children\u0027s hospital. Methods: The data from 60 consecutive critically ill mechanically ventilated children who underwent NB-BAL was reviewed from November 1997 to December 1999. PRISM score prior to NB-BAL, observations at the time of NB-BAL and arterial blood gases, oxygenation index (OI), ventilator settings, haemodynamic variables and temperature taken at 1 h before, and 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL, were retrieved from the archived computerised database. Results: Median age was 7 months (IQR 2.8\u201343 months) and median weight was 5.5 kg (IQR 4\u201314 kg). Four (7%) patients exhibited significant immediate complications, requiring escalation of respiratory or haemodynamic support. Forty-two (70%) patients had complete data for calculation of OI; there was no significant change in median OI at 1 and 6 h after NB-BAL. However 5 (12%) of these patients experienced an increase in OI of between 10 and 45 at 1 h post NB-BAL, which returned to baseline at 6 h post NB-BAL. Complications did not correlate with any of the available variables: baseline OI, PRISM score or with deterioration at the time of the procedure, although it was observed that four out of the six patients with baseline OIs of greater than 20 experienced complications. Conclusion: Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage in critically ill mechanically ventilated neonates and children is generally a well-tolerated procedure, but for some patients, in whom it was not possible to elucidate predictive factors, complications developed. All patients, particularly those with OIs of greater than 20, require careful monitoring during and after the procedure.","publish_time":"2001-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burmester, Margarita; Mok, Quen","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f404c287df007bf7879b73dbc5a9c1673d280f2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzU4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","h post NB-BAL","time of NB","ventilated children","experienced complications","baseline OIs of greater","significant immediate complications","months","PRISM score","haemodynamic variables","Median age","ventilated neonates","median weight","IQR","safety of non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage","well-tolerated procedure","available variables","haemodynamic support","complete data","significant change","Paediatric intensive care unit","arterial blood gases","oxygenation index","ventilator settings","escalation of respiratory","tertiary children\u0027s hospital","temperature","observations","Conclusion","deterioration","predictive factors","careful monitoring","Results","calculation","archived computerised database","Methods","Objective","increase"],"language":"en"},

PATIENTS: Women admitted during pregnancy or 6 weeks postpartum between 1992 and 2001. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients from BTGH (n=174) and KEMH (n=754) had comparable age, number of organs affected, incidence of medical disorders (30%), liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. Fewer KEMH patients received prenatal care (27 vs 86%) and came to hospital within 24 h of onset of symptoms (60 vs 90%). They had higher APACHE II scores (median 16 vs 10), greater incidence of neurological (63 vs 36%), renal (50 vs 37%), and cardiovascular dysfunction (39 vs 29%). Severe malaria, viral hepatitis, cerebral venous thrombosis, and poisoning were common medical disorders. The BTGH group had higher incidence of respiratory dysfunction (59 vs 46%) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (40 vs 23%), placental anomalies, HELLP syndrome, chorioamnionitis, peripartum cardiomyopathy, puerperal sepsis, urinary infection, bacteremia, substance abuse, and asthma. More BTGH patients required mechanical ventilation and blood component therapy, whereas more KEMH patients needed dialysis. Of BTGH patients, 78.2% were delivered by cesarean section (vs 15.4%). Maternal (2.3 vs 25%) and fetal (13 vs 51%) mortality were lower in BTGH patients. CONCLUSIONS: There were marked differences in medical diseases, organ failure, and intensive care needs.

Early and late AKI were defined as AKI occurring on intensive care unit (ICU) day 2 or before, or after ICU day 2, respectively. Demographic data and information on organ dysfunction were collected daily. RESULTS: Of 84 patients, AKI developed in 43 patients (51%). Twenty (24%) needed renal replacement therapy. Early and late AKI were found in 28 (33%) and 15 (18%) patients, respectively. Patients with AKI, as compared with patients without AKI, had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and ICU mortality (72% versus 39%, p \u003C 0.01) and presented on admission more marked cardiovascular, respiratory, and hematological dysfunction.

Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures(1). Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential costs and benefits of different options(2,3,4,5). Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation(6) to examine intervention options should initial containment(6,7) of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2\u20133 weeks unless more than 99% effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak attack rates by up to 40%, but has little impact on overall attack rates, whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50% of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce clinical attack rates by 40\u201350%. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce attack rates by over 75%. Vaccine stockpiled in advance of a pandemic could significantly reduce attack rates even if of low efficacy. Estimates of policy effectiveness will change if the characteristics of a future pandemic strain differ substantially from those seen in past pandemics.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective pilot study, a level III neonatal and pediatric intensive care unit at a University children\u0027s Hospital. PATIENTS: We studied 22 ventilated pediatric (n = 15) and neonatal (n = 7) intensive care patients (aged 3 days\u201316 years). Inclusion criteria were mechanical ventilation and signs of at least one additional organ dysfunction (cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, hematological, or renal). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Serum concentrations of the adhesion molecules were analyzed on the day of maximum organ dysfunction score and were quantitated by a sandwich ELISA technique. The overall mortality rate was 36% (8/22). Dysfunction of three or more organ systems was defined as MODS and was associated with a significant increase in VCAM-1 serum levels relative to dysfunction of three or fewer organ systems [median 1239 ng/ml (IQR 928\u20131615) vs. 766 ng/ml (644\u2013915)]. A significant difference in E-selectin serum levels was found between organ failure of infectious (median 131 ng/ml, IQR 112\u2013146) and noninfectious origin (68 ng/ml 49\u2013105). CONCLUSIONS: Determination of adhesion molecules in pediatric intensive care patients raises the possibility of more specific pathophysiological understanding. E-selectin showed significantly different serum levels between infectious and noninfectious causes of organ failure.","publish_time":"2006-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krueger, Marcus; Heinzmann, Andrea; Nauck, Markus","journal":"Intensive Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66eed2fcc3c3a1752be613160928d590c512af98.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095409.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095409/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzY1MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["additional organ dysfunction","pediatric intensive care patients","organ failure of infectious","serum concentrations","E-selectin serum levels","fewer organ systems","pediatric intensive care unit","noninfectious causes of organ failure","different serum levels","serum levels relative","day of maximum organ dysfunction score","infection-triggered organ failure","Determination of adhesion molecules","intracellular adhesion molecule","VCAM","MODS","IQR","varying severity of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome","soluble forms of vascular cell adhesion molecule","significant difference","noninfectious origin","significant increase","signs","possibility","Prospective pilot study","University children\u0027s Hospital","mechanical ventilation","Inclusion criteria","DESIGN","SETTING","ICAM","RESULTS","days","specific pathophysiological understanding","CONCLUSIONS","MEASUREMENTS","sandwich ELISA technique","overall mortality rate","OBJECTIVE","years"],"language":"en"},

The ability of the number of fulfilled extended donor criteria as currently defined by the German Medical Association (B\u00C4K-Score) to predict early outcome is unclear. PATIENTS: A total of 291 consecutive adult liver transplantations (01.01.2007\u201331.12.2010) in 257 adult recipients were analyzed. METHODS: Primary study endpoints were 30 day mortality, 3 month mortality, 3 month patient and graft survival and the necessity of acute retransplantation within 30 days. For primary study endpoints a ROC curve analysis was performed to calculate sensitivity, specificity and overall model correctness of the B\u00C4K score as a predictive model. Further methods included Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests, Cox regression analysis, logistic regression analysis and \u03C7(2)-tests. RESULTS: The number of extended donor criteria fulfilled had no statistically significant influence on the primary study endpoints (p \u003E 0.05) or on patient survival (p \u003E 0.05).

STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: The standard imaging modality for the work-up of granulomatous diseases of the lungs is most often thin-slice computed tomography (CT). There are a few instances, e. g. tuberculosis, sarcoidosis and silicosis, where a chest radiograph still plays an important role. METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: Further radiological modalities are usually not needed in the routine work-up of granulomatous diseases of the chest. In special cases magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scans play an important role, e. g. detecting cardiac sarcoidosis by cardiac MRI or choline C\u201111 PET-CT in diagnosing lung carcinoma in scar tissue after tuberculosis. PERFORMANCE: The accuracy of thin-slice CT is very high for granulomatous diseases. ACHIEVEMENTS: In cases of chronic disease and fibrotic interstitial lung disease it is important to perform thin-slice CT in order to diagnose a specific disease pattern. Thin-slice CT is also highly sensitive in detecting disease complications and comorbidities, such as malignancies. Given these indications thin-slice CT is generally accepted in the routine daily practice. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: A thin-slice CT and an interdisciplinary discussion are recommended in many cases with a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary granulomatous disease due to clinical or radiographic findings.","publish_time":"2016-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Piel, S.; Kreuter, M.; Herth, F.; Kauczor, H.-U.; Heu\u00DFel, C.-P.","journal":"Radiologe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f217e858ade1ac10d6ba20f9457ef946a5fdd4f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7095880.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095880/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzcyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["e. g."],"organizations":["STANDARD","CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["slice CT","PET-CT","CT scans","granulomatous diseases","cases of chronic disease","disease complications","important role","slice computed tomography","specific disease pattern","important imaging finding","suspected diagnosis of pulmonary granulomatous disease","various diseases","fibrotic interstitial lung disease","cardiac MRI","cardiac sarcoidosis","standard imaging modality","lungs","tuberculosis","routine work","special cases magnetic resonance imaging","STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS","pulmonary manifestations","METHODICAL ISSUE","radiological modalities","chest radiograph","METHODICAL INNOVATIONS","diagnosing lung carcinoma","positron emission tomography","signs of specific inflammation","routine daily practice","choline C","Granulomas","scar tissue","order","comorbidities","silicosis","interdisciplinary discussion","radiographic findings","ACHIEVEMENTS","accuracy","PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS","malignancies","instances","indications","PERFORMANCE"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we are addressing the issue of spreading public concern about epidemics. Public concern about a communicable disease can be seen as a problem of its own. Keeping track of trends in concern about public health and identifying peaks of public concern are therefore crucial tasks. However, monitoring public health concerns is not only expensive with traditional surveillance systems, but also suffers from limited coverage and significant delays. To address these problems, we are using Twitter messages, which are available free of cost, are generated world-wide, and are posted in real time. We are measuring public concern using a two-step sentiment classification approach. In the first step, we distinguish Personal tweets from News (i.e., Non-Personal) tweets. In the second step, we further separate Personal Negative from Personal Non-Negative tweets. Both these steps consist themselves of two sub-steps. In the first sub-step (of both steps), our programs automatically generate training data using an emotion-oriented, clue-based method. In the second sub-step, we are training and testing three different Machine Learning (ML) models with the training data from the first sub-step; this allows us to determine the best ML model for different datasets. Furthermore, we are testing the already trained ML models with a human annotated, disjoint dataset. Based on the number of tweets classified as Personal Negative, we compute a Measure of Concern (MOC) and a timeline of the MOC. We attempt to correlate peaks of the MOC timeline to peaks of the News (Non-Personal) timeline. Our best accuracy results are achieved using the two-step method with a Na\u00EFve Bayes classifier for the Epidemic domain (six datasets) and the Mental Health domain (three datasets).","publish_time":"2015-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ji, Xiang; Chun, Soon Ae; Wei, Zhi; Geller, James","journal":"Soc Netw Anal Min","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b27d0eac3f6d6207ea39ac2aa7f4dca9b4fc32c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7096866.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096866/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzgxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MOC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peaks of public concern","Personal tweets","public health concerns","Personal Non-Negative tweets","Measure of Concern","sub-steps","separate Personal Negative","important task of public health officials","MOC timeline","Mental Health domain","track of health issues","different datasets","number of tweets","training data","two-step method","models","News","epidemics","clue-based method","Epidemic domain","track of trends","different Machine Learning","best accuracy results","two-step sentiment classification approach","Na\u00EFve Bayes classifier","emotion-oriented","Twitter messages","available free of cost","traditional surveillance systems","limited coverage","disjoint dataset","communicable disease","crucial tasks","significant delays","programs","problems","real time","paper"],"language":"en"},

Conventional methods of viral diagnosis detect only a limited number of the viruses that are known to cause outbreaks. The availability of sensitive and specific molecular assays has facilitated rapid diagnosis of a wider range of viruses from respiratory outbreaks. Molecular methods have distinct advantages over conventional methods, including the ability to rapidly develop assays for emerging viruses and new variants of existing viruses. In addition, molecular testing allows rapid detection of resistance to antiviral agents or mutations leading to increased virulence. However, high-throughput molecular testing requires batch processes that may compromise the ability to respond quickly to urgent testing demands.","publish_time":"2012-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antonishyn, Nick A.; Levett, Paul N.","journal":"Mol Diagn Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24e6a3b69127a1ac0dfdb382a4f1b86bf6cdb464.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099217.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099217/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzkxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Molecular methods","specific molecular assays","respiratory outbreaks","emerging viruses","Conventional methods of viral diagnosis","high-throughput molecular testing","Outbreaks of viral respiratory disease","specific cause","Control of outbreaks","specific antiviral agents","rapid diagnosis","wider range of viruses","viral etiology","new variants of existing viruses","urgent testing demands","high morbidity","rapid detection of resistance","institutions","immune status","batch processes","mutations","prohylaxis","treatment","distinct advantages","mortality","availability of sensitive","limited number","addition","affected patients","increased virulence","cohorting","isolation"],"language":"en"},

When MERS-CoV was first identified, the closest related virus was in bats; however, it has since been recognized that dromedary camels serve as a virus reservoir and potential source for human infections. A total of 376 camels were screened for MERS-Cov at a live animal market in the Eastern Region of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, UAE. In all, 109 MERS-CoV-positive camels were detected in week 1, and a subset of positive camels were sampled again weeks 3 through 6. A total of 126 full and 3 nearly full genomes were obtained from 139 samples. Spike gene sequences were obtained from 5 of the 10 remaining samples. The camel MERS-CoV genomes from this study represent 3 known and 2 potentially new lineages within clade B. Within lineages, diversity of camel and human MERS-CoV sequences are intermixed. We identified sequences from market camels nearly identical to the previously reported 2015 German case who visited the market during his incubation period. We described 10 recombination events in the camel samples. The most frequent recombination breakpoint was the junctions between ORF1b and S. Evidence suggests MERS-CoV infection in humans results from continued introductions of distinct MERS-CoV lineages from camels. This hypothesis is supported by the camel MERS-CoV genomes sequenced in this study. Our study expands the known repertoire of camel MERS-CoVs circulating on the Arabian Peninsula.","publish_time":"2017-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yusof, Mohammed Farouk; Queen, Krista; Eltahir, Yassir Mohammed; Paden, Clinton R; Al Hammadi, Zulaikha Mohamed Abdel Hameed; Tao, Ying; Li, Yan; Khalafalla, Abdelmalik Ibrahim; Shi, Mang; Zhang, Jing; Mohamed, Muzammil Sayed Ahmed Elhaj; Abd Elaal Ahmed, Mahmud Hamed; Azeez, Ihsaan Abdulwahab; Bensalah, Oum Keltoum; Eldahab, Ziyada Swar; Al Hosani, Farida Ismail; Gerber, Susan I; Hall, Aron J; Tong, Suxiang; Al Muhairi, Salama Suhail","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19a804b052b806f48b58c353d70c4bda178ad87f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5717090.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29116217/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2017.89","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU5LmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1709193,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"4cXUdfePVPo1UbEwgCDn/A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_59.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S.

The virus contains a novel constellation of gene segments, the nearest known precursors being viruses found in swine and it probably arose through reassortment of two viruses of swine origin. Specific markers for virulence can be evaluated in the viral genome, PB1-F2 is a molecular marker of pathogenicity but is not present in the new S-OIV. While attention was focused on a threat of an avian influenza H5N1 pandemic emerging from Asia, a novel influenza virus of swine origin emerged in North America, and is now spreading worldwide. However, S-OIV demonstrates that even serotypes already encountered in past human pandemics may constitute new pandemic threats. There are concerns that this virus may mutate or reassort with existing influenza viruses giving rise to more transmissible or more pathogenic viruses. The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic virus was relatively mild in its first wave and acquired more virulence when it returned in the winter. Thus preparedness on a global scale against a potential more virulent strain is highly recommended. Most isolates of the new S-OIVs are susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, and currently a vaccine against the pandemic strain is being manufactured and will be available this fall. This review summarizes the current information on the new pandemic swine-origin influenza virus A/H1N1.","publish_time":"2009-10-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schnitzler, Sebastian U.; Schnitzler, Paul","journal":"Virus Genes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03ef3bf95b15cf1f11ff6c5b796cc1feb3f2616e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088521.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzQ50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia","North America"],"keyphrases":["new pandemic swine-origin influenza virus","novel influenza virus of swine origin","viruses of swine origin","existing influenza viruses","new pandemic threats","pandemic strain","avian influenza H5N1 pandemic","Spanish flu pandemic virus","new S-OIVs","major influenza outbreaks","recent flu pandemic","pathogenic viruses","emergence of new strains","H1N1","virulence factors","occasional pandemics","virulent strain","past human pandemics","novel constellation of gene segments","Asia","nearest known precursors","PB1-F2","potential","challenges","rise","annual epidemics","current information","global scale","neuraminidase inhibitors","public health","infection","vaccine","opportunity","molecular marker of pathogenicity","reassortment","scientific communities","viral genome","North America","spread","future","isolates","preparedness","review","lives of millions","Specific markers","wave","fall","attention","winter"],"language":"en"},

We examined a related common species widely distributed in Africa, Z. mucronata, whose economic value has not, as yet, been explored. Local people in various African countries use its different parts to cure a large number of diseases, many of which are similar to those treated with Z. jujuba and Z. mauritiana.

In terms of progress, while we have accomplished many tasks proposed by Solomon et al. (The quality of life, Sage, London 1980), some of them are yet to be achieved. Regarding research paradigms surrounding social indicators, researchers have primarily used positivistic or post-positivistic orientation to conduct and interpret social indicators research, with relatively fewer studies using interpretive, constructionist or critical theory perspective. There are also several puzzles deserving consideration. These include (a) the use of \u201Cother types of evidence\u201D, particularly qualitative data; (b) evaluation of social programs; (c) feasibility of assessing \u201Csocial progress\u201D; (d) choice of social indicators; (e) interpretation of findings; (f) methodological debates; and (g) explanations for social change.

The virus caused cytopathic effect (CPE) in C6/36 cells and passaged stably. Polyacrylamide gel analysis showed that the genome of YN12243 was composed of 12 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), with a distribution pattern of 6-6. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the coding region (1\u201212 segments) were 17,803 bp and 5,925 amino acids in length, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of VP1 protein (RdRp) revealed that YN12243 belonged to genus Seadornavirus of family Reoviridae, and further analysis indicated that YN12243 belongs to the Banna virus (BAV) genotype A2. Additionally, YN12243 was located in the same evolutionary cluster as BAV strains isolated from different mosquito species, suggesting that the BAV isolated from Culicoides does not have species barriers. These results indicate that Culicoides can also be a vector for BAV. In view of the hematophagous habits of Culicoides on cattle, horses, deer, and other large animals, as well as the possibility of spreading and causing a variety of animal arboviral diseases, it is important to improve infection detection and monitor the BAV in large livestock.","publish_time":"2017-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Song; Li, Yuanyuan; Fu, Shihong; Lei, Wenwen; Guo, Xiaofang; Feng, Yun; Gao, Xiaoyan; Li, Xiaolong; Yang, Zhonghua; Xu, Ziqian; He, Ying; Wang, Huanyu; Zhou, Hongning; Wang, Bin; Lu, Xiaoqing; Liang, Guodong","journal":"Sci China Life Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8efcadf7f62762bddfca87c01a3a764687f2fb5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089225/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzE2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["BAV strains","genome of YN12243","Culicoides samples","Banna virus","hematophagous habits of Culicoides","Polyacrylamide gel analysis","coding region","phylogenetic analysis of VP1 protein","amino acids","segments of double","large animals","species barriers","large livestock","amino acid sequences","different mosquito species","Sino-Burmese border region of Yunnan Province","dsRNA","CPE","cattle","deer","horses","RdRp","genus Seadornavirus of family Reoviridae","variety of animal arboviral diseases","C6","stranded RNA","China","insects","cytopathic effect","bp","evolutionary cluster","arboviruses","genotype A2","infection detection","length","nucleotide","view","investigation of blood","distribution pattern","possibility","cells","vector","results"],"language":"en"},

We validated these expressions using individual-based simulations. We further showed that moving-window estimates of these quantities may be used for anticipating critical transitions in infectious disease systems. Although leading indicators of elimination were highly predictive, we found the approach to emergence to be much more difficult to detect.

An extensive preclinical program evaluated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of BAX326 in different species. The efficacy of BAX326 was tested in three mouse models of primary pharmacodynamics: tail-tip bleeding, carotid occlusion, and thrombelastography. The pharmacokinetics was evaluated after a single intravenous bolus injection in mice, rats, and macaques. Toxicity was assessed in rats and macaques, safety pharmacology in rabbits and macaques, and immunogenicity in mice. BAX326 was shown to be efficacious in all three primary pharmacodynamic studies (P \u2264 0.0076). Hemostatic efficacy was dose related and similar for the three lots tested. Pharmacokinetic results showed that rFIX activity and rFIX antigen concentrations declined in a bi-phasic manner, similar to a previously licensed rFIX product. BAX326 was well tolerated in rabbits and macaques at all dose levels; no thrombogenic events and no adverse clinical, respiratory, or cardiovascular effects occurred. BAX326 was also shown to have a similar immunogenicity profile to the comparator rFIX product in mice. These results demonstrate that BAX326 has a favorable preclinical safety and efficacy profile, predictive of a comparable effect to that of the previously licensed rFIX in humans.

A major limitation to the clinical utility of adenoviruses is the low efficiency of gene transfer achieved in vivo. In addition, little is known about the initial interactions between adenoviruses and the target cell. To address the hypothesis that the negative charge presented by membrane glycoproteins reduces the efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, primary cultures of human airway, Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney cells, an immortalized cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cell line, and primary cultures of sheep pulmonary artery endothelium were infected with recombinant adeno- virus containing the E. coli lacZ reporter gene (Ad2\u03B2gal2) in the presence of various polyions. For each cell type, adsorption of Ad2\u03B2gal2 in the presence of the polycations polybrene, protamine, DEAE-dextran, and poly-L-lysine significantly increased the percentage of cells that express lacZ. The polyanion heparin did not significantly alter gene transfer efficiency, but completely abrogated the effects of polycations. These data provide evidence that negatively charged moieties on the cell surface reduce the efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, and that alteration of the charge interaction between adenoviruses and the cell surface may improve the potential clinical application of these vectors.","publish_time":"1997-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arcasoy, SM; Latoche, JD; Gondor, M; Pitt, BR; Pilewski, JM","journal":"Gene Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2d78f91ecc771cdd49be85eb3e2f93970824748.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091802/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYuY3N2OzM2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1359984,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oZ5hGakJtLHwUPbwkcViNQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_6.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene transfer efficiency","mediated gene transfer","low efficiency of gene transfer","gene therapy","cell surface","efficiency of adenovirus","target cell","cell type","Recombinant adenoviruses","coli lacZ reporter gene","clinical utility of adenoviruses","immortalized cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cell line","primary cultures of human airway","percentage of cells","adsorption of Ad2\u03B2gal2","charge interaction","negative charge","polycations polybrene","express lacZ","effects of polycations","primary cultures of sheep pulmonary artery endothelium","potential clinical application","recombinant adeno- virus","presence of various polyions","Darby canine kidney cells","Madin","alteration","prevention","protamine","lung diseases","membrane glycoproteins","DEAE-dextran","moieties","major limitation","initial interactions","treatment of vascular thrombosis","lysine","vectors","polyanion heparin","data","evidence","hypothesis","addition"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: The kinetic parameters of the fluorogenic substrate have been determined as K(m)=404 \u03BCmol\u00B7L(\u22121), k(cat)=1.08 min(\u22121), and k(cat)/K(m)=2.7 mmol(\u22121)\u00B7L\u00B7min(\u22121). SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) showed substantial pH and temperature-triggered activity switches, and site-directed mutagenesis analysis of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro) revealed that substitutions of His(41), Cys(145), and His(163) resulted in complete loss of enzymatic activity, while replacement of Met(162) with Ala caused strongly increased activity. CONCLUSION: This present work has provided valuable information for understanding the catalytic mechanism of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro).

Methods MERS-CoV infected patients who were managed in a tertiary care center during the 2015 Korean MERS outbreak were reviewed. To analyze predictive factors for pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure, we evaluated clinical variables measured within three days from symptom onset. Results A total of 45 patients were included in the study: 13 patients (28.9%) did not develop pneumonia, 19 developed pneumonia without respiratory failure (42.2%), and 13 progressed to respiratory failures (28.9%). The identified predictive factors for pneumonia development included age \u226545 years, fever \u226537.5 \u00B0C, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, CRP \u2265 2 mg/dL, and a threshold cycle value of PCR less than 28.5. For respiratory failure, the indicators included male, hypertension, low albumin concentration, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and CRP \u2265 4 mg/dL (all P \u003C 0.05). With \u2265 two predictive factors for pneumonia development, 100% of patients developed pneumonia. Patients lacking the predictive factors did not progress to respiratory failure. Conclusion For successful control of MERS outbreak, MERS-CoV infected patients with \u2265 two predictive factors should be intensively managed from the initial presentation.","publish_time":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ko, Jae-Hoon; Park, Ga Eun; Lee, Ji Yeon; Lee, Ji Yong; Cho, Sun Young; Ha, Young Eun; Kang, Cheol-In; Kang, Ji-Man; Kim, Yae-Jean; Huh, Hee Jae; Ki, Chang-Seok; Jeong, Byeong-Ho; Park, Jinkyeong; Chung, Chi Ryang; Chung, Doo Ryeon; Song, Jae-Hoon; Peck, Kyong Ran","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7c3630a4f3bf645da90e5f30fc34c2cc90816d06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112644.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27519621/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2016.08.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445316302092; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445316302092","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5NTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["developed pneumonia","prediction of pneumonia development","respiratory failures","Korean MERS outbreak","identified predictive factors","Methods MERS-CoV infected patients","successful control of MERS outbreak","Middle East respiratory syndrome","progression","thrombocytopenia","lymphopenia","CRP","male","low albumin concentration","hypertension","age","years","indicators","clinical variables","tertiary care center","days","fever","Conclusion","Summary Background","threshold cycle value of PCR","symptom onset","study","initial presentation","total"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we investigated the immunogenicity and parasitological levels after intradermal challenge with Leishmania infantum plus salivary gland extract in dogs immunized with a vaccine composed of L. braziliensis antigens plus saponin as an adjuvant (LBSap vaccine). The LBSap vaccine elicited higher levels of total anti-Leishmania IgG as well as both IgG1 and IgG2.

Furthermore, LBSap vaccinated dogs presented high IFN-\u03B3 and low IL-10 and TGF-\u03B21 expression in spleen with significant reduction of parasite load in this tissue. Overall, our results validate the potential of LBSap vaccine to protect against L. infantum experimental infection and strongly support further evaluation of efficiency of LBSap against CVL in natural infection conditions.","publish_time":"2012-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roatt, Bruno Mendes; Aguiar-Soares, Rodrigo Dian de Oliveira; Vitoriano-Souza, Juliana; Coura-Vital, Wendel; Braga, Samuel Le\u00F4ncio; Corr\u00EAa-Oliveira, Rodrigo; Martins-Filho, Olindo Assis; Teixeira-Carvalho, Andr\u00E9a; de Lana, Marta; Gontijo, Nelder Figueiredo; Marques, Marcos Jos\u00E9; Giunchetti, Rodolfo Cordeiro; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/434bd9335384207d750282844ad8ceb545e50462.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3506642.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23189161/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LBSap","CVL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential of LBSap vaccine","LBSap vaccinated dogs","vaccine trials","vaccine soluble antigen","infantum experimental infection","higher levels of CD4","increased levels of lymphocytes","Leishmania infantum","infantum antigen","parasitological levels","experimental challenge","T lymphocytes specific","higher levels of total anti-Leishmania IgG","natural infection conditions","soluble lysate of","intradermal challenge","spleen","long periods","high IFN-\u03B3","salivary gland extract","new vaccines","CVL","significant reduction of parasite load","low IL","immune protection","TGF-\u03B21 expression","search","circulating B cells","saponin","adjuvant","cell proliferation","canine visceral leishmaniasis","evaluation of efficiency","braziliensis antigens","immunogenicity","days","decade","tissue","CD21","pattern","IgG1","CD8","results","IgG2"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of the study was synthesis and investigation of antiviral activity of camphor-based symmetric diimines and diamines. A set of C2-symmetric nitrogen-containing camphor derivatives have been synthesized. The antiviral activity of these compounds was studied against rimantadine- and amantadine-resistant influenza virus A/California/7/09 (H1N1)pdm09 in MDCK cells. The highest efficacy in virus inhibiting was shown for compounds 2a\u2013e with cage moieties bound by aliphatic linkers. The therapeutic index (selectivity index) for 2b exceeded that for reference compounds amantadine, deitiforin and rimantadine almost 10-fold. As shown by structure\u2013activity analysis, the length of the linker has a dramatic effect on the toxicity of compounds. Compound 2e with \u2013C12H24\u2013 linker exhibited the lowest toxicity (CTD50 =2216\u03BCM).

Crystal structures of almost all available flavivirus methyltransferases contain S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), the methyl donor molecule that co-purifies with the enzymes. This raises a possibility that SAM is an integral structural component required for the folding of dengue virus (DENV) methyltransferase. Here we exclude this possibility by solving the crystal structure of DENV methyltransferase without SAM. The SAM ligand was removed from the enzyme through a urea-mediated denaturation-and-renaturation protocol. The crystal structure of the SAM-depleted enzyme exhibits a vacant SAM-binding pocket, with a conformation identical to that of the SAM-enzyme co-crystal structure. Functionally, equivalent enzymatic activities (N-7 methylation, 2\u2032-O methylation, and GMP-enzyme complex formation) were detected for the SAM-depleted and SAM-containing recombinant proteins. These results clearly indicate that the SAM molecule is not an essential component for the correct folding of DENV methyltransferase. Furthermore, the results imply a potential antiviral approach to search for inhibitors that can bind to the SAM-binding pocket and compete against SAM binding. To demonstrate this potential, we have soaked crystals of DENV methyltransferase without a bound SAM with the natural product Sinefungin and show that preformed crystals are capable of binding ligands in this pocket.","publish_time":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Noble, Christian G.; Li, Shi-Hua; Dong, Hongping; Chew, Sock Hui; Shi, Pei-Yong","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f3df95953918ed64ed5a4032944d270423e195a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113791.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241250/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354214002563; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.09.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354214002563","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs5OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["SAM"],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SAM binding","SAM molecule","bound SAM","SAM ligand","SAM-depleted enzyme","vacant SAM-binding pocket","SAM-enzyme co-crystal structure","crystal structure of DENV methyltransferase","crystals of DENV methyltransferase","correct folding of DENV methyltransferase","Abstract Flavivirus methyltransferase","Crystal structures","capable of binding ligands","results","possibility","GMP-enzyme complex formation","potential antiviral approach","preformed crystals","essential component","O methylation","antiviral target","integral structural component","folding of dengue virus","available flavivirus methyltransferases","methyl donor molecule","natural product Sinefungin","S-adenosyl","inhibitors","urea-mediated denaturation","search","methionine","conformation identical","equivalent enzymatic activities","renaturation protocol","enzymes","recombinant proteins"],"language":"en"},

However, there is still very limited data on the course and outcomes of this serious infection in a vulnerable population of pregnant patients and their fetuses. International perinatal societies and institutions including SMFM, ACOG, RCOG, ISUOG, CDC, CNGOF, ISS/SIEOG, and CatSalut have released guidelines for the care of these patients. We aim to summarize these current guidelines in a comprehensive review for patients, healthcare workers, and healthcare institutions. We included 15 papers from 10 societies through a literature search of direct review of society\u0027s websites and their journal publications up till 20 April 2020.

In both military and civilian settings, transmission of respiratory pathogens may be due to person-to-person and environmental contributions. This possibility was explored in a military training setting, where rates of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) often reach epidemic levels. Methods. Population size and FRI rates were monitored over 10 months in the units of 50\u201390 individuals. Some units were open to the influx of potentially infectious convalescents (hereafter referred to as \u201Copen units,\u201D and some were closed to such an influx (hereafter referred to as \u201Cclosed units\u201D). Virologic testing and polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to detect adenovirus on surface structures. Results. The odds ratio (OR) associated with FRI in closed units, compared with open units, was 1.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99\u20131.28). The OR in units with a population greater than the median size, compared with units with a population lower than the median size was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.23\u20131.55). Between 5% and 9% of surface samples obtained from selected units harbored viable adenovirus. Conclusions. FRI rates were not reduced in units that were closed to potentially contagious individuals. These findings imply that the primary source of the pathogen is likely environmental rather than human, and they underscore what is known about other virus types. Diligence in identifying the relative roles of different transmission routes is suggested for civilian settings similar to those described in the current study.","publish_time":"2008-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broderick, Michael P.; Hansen, Christian J.; Russell, Kevin L.","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50443e443307f60551496ada4c5c5da31a436950.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109839.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18823270/; https://doi.org/10.1086/592711","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["closed units","open units","selected units","Population size","median size","person","population greater","population lower","influx","rates of febrile respiratory illness","transmission of respiratory pathogens","civilian settings similar","viable adenovirus","environmental contributions","surface samples","surface structures","contagious individuals","military training setting","relative roles of different transmission routes","polymerase chain reaction analysis","Virologic testing","primary source","human","infectious convalescents","findings","Diligence","confidence interval","possibility","months","current study","epidemic levels","odds ratio","virus types","Background","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Despite the nationwide use of commercially available attenuated and inactivated vaccines in South Korea, PEDV has continued to plague the domestic pork industry, raising concerns regarding their protective efficacies and the need for new vaccine development. In a previous study, we isolated and serially cultivated a Korean PEDV epidemic strain, KOR/KNU-141112/2014, in Vero cells. With the availability of a cell culture-propagated PEDV strain, we are able to explore vaccination and challenge studies on pigs. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to produce an inactivated PEDV vaccine using the KNU-141112 strain and evaluate its effectiveness in neonatal piglets. Pregnant sows were immunized intramuscularly with the inactivated adjuvanted monovalent vaccine at six and three weeks prior to farrowing. Six-day-old piglets born to vaccinated or unvaccinated sows were challenged with the homogeneous KNU-141112 virus. The administration of the inactivated vaccine to sows greatly increased the survival rate of piglets challenged with the virulent strain, from 0% to approximately 92% (22/24), and significantly reduced diarrhea severity including viral shedding in feces. In addition, litters from unvaccinated sows continued to lose body weight throughout the experiment, whereas litters from vaccinated sows started recovering their daily weight gain at 7 days after the challenge. Furthermore, strong neutralizing antibody responses to PEDV were verified in immunized sows and their offspring, but were absent in the unvaccinated controls. Altogether, our data demonstrated that durable lactogenic immunity was present in dams administrated with the inactivated vaccine and subsequently conferred critical passive immune protection to their own litters against virulent PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baek, Pil-Soo; Choi, Hwan-Won; Lee, Sunhee; Yoon, In-Joong; Lee, Young Ju; Lee, Du Sik; Lee, Seungyoon; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3f20010d78db20f4af58bb56cf7ab833bccbbf0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126956.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242716300666; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242716300666; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.04.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185262/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["inactivated PEDV vaccine","unvaccinated sows","immunized sows","Korean PEDV epidemic strain","Pregnant sows","virulent PEDV infection","inactivated vaccines","litters","inactivated adjuvanted monovalent vaccine","virulent strain","cell culture-propagated PEDV strain","new vaccine development","homogeneous KNU","South Korea","neonatal piglets","present study","unvaccinated controls","survival rate of piglets","day-old piglets","body weight","challenge studies","previous study","Abstract Massive outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","reduced diarrhea severity","daily weight gain","country","dams","critical passive immune protection","concerns","tremendous financial impact","viral shedding","durable lactogenic immunity","protective efficacies","need","experiment","strong neutralizing antibody responses","producers","consumers","vaccination","feces","days","domestic pork industry","nationwide use","swine breeding herds","data","availability","pigs","weeks","effectiveness","addition","Vero cells","aim","offspring","administration","farrowing"],"language":"en"},

HYPOTHESIS: Propentofylline (PPF) can decrease vasculitis, and therefore prolong survival time in cats with FIP, and increase their quality of life. ANIMALS: Twenty\u2010three privately owned cats with FIP. METHODS: Placebo\u2010controlled double\u2010blind trial. FIP was confirmed by histology or immunostaining of feline coronavirus (FCoV) antigen in effusion or tissue macrophages or both. The cats were randomly selected for treatment with either PPF or placebo. All cats received additional treatment with glucocorticoids, antibiotics, and low molecular weight heparin according to methods. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the survival time of cats treated with PPF (8 days, 95% CI 5.4\u201310.6) versus placebo (7.5 days, 95% CI 4.4\u20139.6). The median survival time of all cats was 8 days (4\u201336 days).

Therefore, PPF does not appear to be an effective treatment option in cats with a late stage of the disease FIP.","publish_time":"2011-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fischer, Y.; Ritz, S.; Weber, K.; Sauter\u2010Louis, C.; Hartmann, K.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9832e99b5e9cf68d174c2d2f53f87e1ba054c971.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166892.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-1676.2011.00806.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22092616/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIP","PPF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["survival time of cats","owned cats","days","disease FIP","median survival time","quality of life","effect of PPF","Placebo","study","additional treatment","METHODS","effusion","CI","effective treatment option","CLINICAL IMPORTANCE","significant difference","immunostaining of feline coronavirus","feline infectious peritonitis","TNF","antibiotics","alpha","antigen","FCoV","glucocorticoids","low molecular weight heparin","late stage","complete blood count","concentration","tumor necrosis factor","small animal biochemistry profile","laboratory parameter","histology","vasculitis","tissue macrophages","CONCLUSIONS","Propentofylline","double\u2010blind trial","HYPOTHESIS","drug","ANIMALS","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","variable"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed among 758 \u0027frontline\u0027 health care workers who cared for SARS patients at the Second Affiliated Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The HCWs with IgG against SARS and those without IgG against SARS were respectively defined as the \u0022case group\u0022 and the \u0022control group\u0022, and logistic regression was conducted to explore the risk factors for SARS infection in HCWs. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender, marital status, educational level, professional title, and the department in which an individual worked, the results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that incidence of SARS among HCWs was significantly and positively associated with: performing tracheal intubations for SARS patients, methods used for air ventilation in wards, avoiding face-to-face interaction with SARS patients, the number of pairs of gloves worn by HCWs, and caring for serious SARS cases. CONCLUSION: Some measures, particularly good air ventilation in SARS wards, may be effective in minimizing or preventing SARS transmission among HCWs in hospitals.","publish_time":"2009-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wei-Qing; Ling, Wen-Hua; Lu, Ci-Yong; Hao, Yuan-Tao; Lin, Zhong-Ning; Ling, Li; Huang, Jian; Li, Gang; Yan, Guang-Mei","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58ebd3ddb3543355def684c9762e4e24388c61bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2666722.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19284644/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-9-81","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","the Second Affiliated Hospital","Sun Yat-sen University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS patients","incidence of SARS","SARS wards","SARS infection","HCWs","SARS transmission","SARS epidemic","serious SARS cases","Affiliated Hospital","METHODS","series of preventive measures","health care workers","RESULTS","IgG","good air ventilation","multivariate logistic regression analysis","control group","case group","retrospective study","high incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome","marital status","educational level","face-to-face interaction","professional title","gender","number of pairs","risk factors","age","use","frontline","tracheal intubations","Yat-sen University","department","gloves","hospitals","individual","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In veterinary medicine, zoonoses present a risk to practitioners, yet little is known about how these risks are understood and how this translates into health protective behaviour. This study aimed to explore risk perceptions within the British veterinary profession and identify motivators and barriers to compliance with IPCs. A cross-sectional study was conducted using veterinary practices registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. Here we demonstrate that compliance with IPCs is influenced by more than just knowledge and experience, and understanding of risk is complex and multifactorial. Out of 252 respondents, the majority were not concerned about the risk of zoonoses (57.5%); however, a considerable proportion (34.9%) was. Overall, 44.0% of respondents reported contracting a confirmed or suspected zoonoses, most frequently dermatophytosis (58.6%). In veterinary professionals who had previous experience of managing zoonotic cases, time or financial constraints and a concern for adverse animal reactions were not perceived as barriers to use of personal protective equipment (PPE). For those working in large animal practice, the most significant motivator for using PPE was concerns over liability. When assessing responses to a range of different \u201Cinfection control attitudes\u201D, veterinary nurses tended to have a more positive perspective, compared with veterinary surgeons. Our results demonstrate that IPCs are not always adhered to, and factors influencing motivators and barriers to compliance are not simply based on knowledge and experience. Educating veterinary professionals may help improve compliance to a certain extent, however increased knowledge does not necessarily equate to an increase in risk-mitigating behaviour. This highlights that the construction of risk is complex and circumstance-specific and to get a real grasp on compliance with IPCs, this construction needs to be explored in more depth.","publish_time":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robin, Charlotte; Bettridge, Judy; McMaster, Fiona","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc079a2e9cf98fad00dd1338ef104d5d39af736a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126003.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587716306109; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587716306109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28010906/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.11.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons","PPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["veterinary practices","veterinary medicine","veterinary professionals","veterinary nurses","risk of zoonoses","compliance","IPCs","construction of risk","risk perceptions","British veterinary profession","risk-mitigating behaviour","Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons","barriers","control practices","motivators","previous experience","PPE","suspected zoonoses","increased knowledge","respondents","infection control attitudes","health protective behaviour","cross-sectional study","effective infection prevention","adverse animal reactions","large animal practice","personal protective equipment","financial constraints","concern","time","zoonotic cases","range of different","significant motivator","circumstance-specific","infections","certain extent","real grasp","positive perspective","Abstract","human","factors","responses","dermatophytosis","majority","highlights","practitioners","considerable proportion","liability","results","risks","depth"],"language":"en"},

MAIN BODY: In particular, hemagglutinin (HA), a highly conserved surface protein across many IV strains, could be an effective antiviral target as it mediates binding of IVs with host cell receptors, which is crucial for membrane fusion. HA has 6 disulfide bonds that can easily bind with the surfaces of gold nanoparticles. Herein, we fabricated porous gold nanoparticles (PoGNPs) via a surfactant-free emulsion method that exhibited strong affinity for disulfide bonds due to gold\u2013thiol interactions, and provided extensive surface area for these interactions. A remarkable decrease in viral infectivity was demonstrated by increased cell viability results after exposing MDCK cells to various IV strains (H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2) treated with PoGNP. Most of all, the viability of MDCK cells infected with all IV strains increased to 96.8% after PoGNP treatment of the viruses compared to 33.9% cell viability with non-treated viruses. Intracellular viral RNA quantification by real-time RT-PCR also confirmed that PoGNP successfully inhibited viral membrane fusion by blocking the viral entry process through conformational deformation of HA. CONCLUSION: We believe that the technique described herein can be further developed for PoGNP-utilized antiviral protection as well as metal nanoparticle-based therapy to treat viral infection. Additionally, facile detection of IAV can be achieved by developing PoGNP as a multiplatform for detection of the virus.","publish_time":"2020-03-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Jinyoung; Yeom, Minjoo; Lee, Taeksu; Kim, Hyun-Ouk; Na, Woonsung; Kang, Aram; Lim, Jong-Woo; Park, Geunseon; Park, Chaewon; Song, Daesub; Haam, Seungjoo","journal":"J Nanobiotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef65ed20fe5354f1a4bf1177be7cb9be333dfb2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092597.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32209114/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-020-00611-8","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjsxNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HA","MDCK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective antiviral target","viral infectivity","viral infection","viral membrane fusion","antiviral drugs","antiviral protection","PoGNP treatment","various IV strains","viral entry process","viability of MDCK cells","commercial antiviral vaccines","increased cell viability results","drug-binding target protein regions","Intracellular viral RNA quantification","binding of IVs","matrix protein","conserved surface protein","disulfide bonds","Influenza viruses","porous gold nanoparticles","non-treated viruses","recent IV pandemics","surfaces of gold nanoparticles","host cell receptors","conformational deformation of HA","thiol interactions","gene mutations","genetic mutations","extensive surface area","facile detection of IAV","strong affinity","real-time RT-PCR","resistance","H1N1","surfactant-free emulsion method","metal nanoparticle-based therapy","PoGNPs","H3N2","neuraminidase","hemagglutinin","MAIN BODY","remarkable decrease","H9N2","BACKGROUND","challenge","CONCLUSION","technique"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate school absenteeism among children with medically attended ARI due to common viruses. METHODS: We analyzed follow\u2010up surveys from children seeking care for acute respiratory illness who were enrolled in the influenza vaccine effectiveness study at Marshfield Clinic during the 2012\u20102013 through 2014\u20102015 influenza seasons. Archived influenza\u2010negative respiratory swabs were retested using multiplex RT\u2010PCR to detect 16 respiratory virus targets. Negative binomial and logistic regression models were used to examine the association between school absence and type of respiratory viruses; endpoints included mean days absent from school and prolonged (\u003E2 days) absence. We examined the association between influenza vaccination and school absence among children with RT\u2010PCR\u2010confirmed influenza. RESULTS: Among 1027 children, 2295 days of school were missed due to medically attended ARIs; influenza accounted for 39% of illness episodes and 47% of days missed. Mean days absent were highest for influenza (0.96\u20101.19) and lowest for coronavirus (0.62). Children with B/Yamagata infection were more likely to report prolonged absence than children with A/H1N1 or A/H3N2 infection [OR (95% CI): 2.1 (1.0, 4.5) and 1.7 (1.0, 2.9), respectively]. Among children with influenza, vaccination status was not associated with prolonged absence. CONCLUSIONS: School absenteeism due to medically attended ARIs varies by viral infection.

The electronic seminars (e-seminars) were developed several months prior to start of the epidemiology course for second-year students at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade. The students who applied for e-seminars accessed their content during summer semester (February\u2013May) 2014. E-seminars were set according to the existing topics in practical workbook and designed using Moodle, a free, open-source, personal home page web application for producing modular internet-based courses. To evaluate the motives for enrollment and satisfaction with seminars, two surveys (pre- and post-course) were administered. Students\u2019 exam grades were registered over 4 exam sessions (June\u2013October 2014) and compared according to seminar program. Out of 516 students in the second year, 60 (11.6 %) applied for e-seminars (mean age 21 years). Students considered the reason \u201CIt\u2019s easier to do assignments from home\u201D as the strongest motive to participate. When compared to classroom seminars, students in e-seminars had significantly more fun (p = 0.003), thought that e-seminars were better mode to learn epidemiology (p = 0.030) and would recommend them to other colleagues (p = 0.001).

More than one host-cell receptor is reported to be recognized by the viral spike protein, among them is the cell-surface Heat Shock Protein A5 (HSPA5), also termed GRP78 or BiP. Upon viral infection, HSPA5 is upregulated, then translocating to the cell membrane where it is subjected to be recognized by the SARS-CoV-2 spike. In this study, some natural product compounds are tested against the HSPA5 substrate-binding domain \u03B2 (SBD\u03B2), which reported to be the recognition site for the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations are used to test some natural compounds binding to HSPA5 SBD\u03B2. The results show high to a moderate binding affinity for the phytoestrogens (Diadiazin, Genistein, Formontein, and Biochanin A), chlorogenic acid, linolenic acid, palmitic acid, caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, hydroxytyrosol, cis-p-Coumaric acid, cinnamaldehyde, thymoquinone, and some physiological hormones such as estrogens, progesterone, testosterone, and cholesterol to the HSPA5 SBD\u03B2. Based on its binding affinities, the phytoestrogens and estrogens are the best in binding HSPA5, hence may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the stressed cells.

This literature review aims to presents accredited and the most current studies pertaining to the basic sciences of SARS-CoV-2, clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19, public health interventions, and current epidemiological developments. The review on basic sciences aims to clarify the jargon in virology, describe the virion structure of SARS-CoV-2 and present pertinent details relevant to clinical practice. Another component discussed is the brief history on the series of experiments used to explore the origins and evolution of the phylogeny of the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the clinical and epidemiological differences between COVID-19 and other infections causing outbreaks (SARS, MERS, H1N1) are elucidated. Emphasis is placed on evidence-based medicine to evaluate the frequency of presentation of various symptoms to create a stratification system of the most important epidemiological risk factors for COVID-19. These can be used to triage and expedite risk assessment. Furthermore, the limitations and statistical strength of the diagnostic tools currently in clinical practice are evaluated. Criteria on rapid screening, discharge from hospital and discontinuation of self-quarantine are clarified. Epidemiological factors influencing the rapid rate of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are described. Accurate information pertinent to improving prevention strategies is also discussed. The penultimate portion of the review aims to explain the involvement of micronutrients such as vitamin C and vitamin D in COVID19 treatment and prophylaxis. Furthermore, the biochemistry of the major candidates for novel therapies is briefly reviewed and a summary of their current status in the clinical trials is presented. Lastly, the current scientific data and status of governing bodies such as the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and the WHO on the usage of controversial therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Ibuprofen), and corticosteroids usage in COVID-19 are discussed. The composite collection of accredited studies on each of these subtopics of COVID-19 within this review will enable clarification and focus on the current status and direction in the planning of the management of this global pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kakodkar, Pramath; Kaka, Nagham; Baig, MN","journal":"Cureus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6314943df23e3c79ded21bd2d5ced6bfd35be893.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138423.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32269893/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Center of Disease Control","CDC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","clinical course","current status","clinical presentation","clinical practice","disease course of COVID","subtopics of COVID","current studies","clinical trials","current epidemiological developments","Epidemiological factors","basic sciences of SARS","epidemiological differences","literature review","current scientific data","virion structure of SARS","viral genome of SARS","important epidemiological risk factors","management","Coronavirus disease","status of governing bodies","Center of Disease Control","usage of controversial therapies","declared global pandemic","vitamin C","vitamin D","misinformation present","present pertinent details relevant","frequency of presentation","rapid screening","novel therapies","rapid rate","composite collection of accredited studies","corticosteroids usage","risk assessment","Accurate information pertinent","nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","inhibitors","ACE","hospital","discharge","public health interventions","sourced manuscript preprints","COVID19 treatment","stratification system","diagnostic tools","NSAIDs","Ibuprofen","enzyme","various symptoms","angiotensin","phylogeny","planning","brief history","statistical strength","discontinuation of self-quarantine","social media","major candidates","prevention strategies","prophylaxis","jargon","outbreaks","MERS","involvement of micronutrients","infections","direction","evidence-based medicine","series of experiments","multiple parameters","origins","biochemistry","evolution","limitations","virology","Criteria","CDC","H1N1","summary","clarification","Emphasis","hindrance","component","penultimate portion","optimization"],"language":"en"},

With the spread and emergence of epizootics, zoonoses, and epidemics, the risks of pandemics became more and more critical. Human and animal health has also been threatened by antimicrobial resistance, environmental pollution, and the development of multifactorial and chronic diseases. This highlighted the increasing globalization of health risks and the importance of the human\u2013animal\u2013ecosystem interface in the evolution and emergence of pathogens. A better knowledge of causes and consequences of certain human activities, lifestyles, and behaviors in ecosystems is crucial for a rigorous interpretation of disease dynamics and to drive public policies. As a global good, health security must be understood on a global scale and from a global and crosscutting perspective, integrating human health, animal health, plant health, ecosystems health, and biodiversity. In this study, we discuss how crucial it is to consider ecological, evolutionary, and environmental sciences in understanding the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases and in facing the challenges of antimicrobial resistance. We also discuss the application of the \u201COne Health\u201D concept to non-communicable chronic diseases linked to exposure to multiple stresses, including toxic stress, and new lifestyles. Finally, we draw up a list of barriers that need removing and the ambitions that we must nurture for the effective application of the \u201COne Health\u201D concept. We conclude that the success of this One Health concept now requires breaking down the interdisciplinary barriers that still separate human and veterinary medicine from ecological, evolutionary, and environmental sciences. The development of integrative approaches should be promoted by linking the study of factors underlying stress responses to their consequences on ecosystem functioning and evolution. This knowledge is required for the development of novel control strategies inspired by environmental mechanisms leading to desired equilibrium and dynamics in healthy ecosystems and must provide in the near future a framework for more integrated operational initiatives.","publish_time":"2018-02-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Destoumieux-Garz\u00F3n, Delphine; Mavingui, Patrick; Boetsch, Gilles; Boissier, J\u00E9r\u00F4me; Darriet, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Duboz, Priscilla; Fritsch, Cl\u00E9mentine; Giraudoux, Patrick; Le Roux, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique; Morand, Serge; Paillard, Christine; Pontier, Dominique; Sueur, C\u00E9dric; Voituron, Yann","journal":"Front Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f7a0834ec2f0e699772cf4c647b0f3cb213b54e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5816263.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29484301/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2018.00014","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human health","ecosystems health","animal health","Health concept","plant health","health security","increasing globalization of health risks","environmental sciences","environmental mechanisms","environmental pollution","consequences of certain human activities","healthy ecosystems","re-emergence of infectious diseases","emergence of epizootics","evolution","development of multifactorial","emergence of pathogens","global scale","non-communicable chronic diseases","development of integrative approaches","challenges of antimicrobial resistance","toxic stress","stress responses","ecosystem interface","ecosystem functioning","development of novel control strategies","new lifestyles","risks of pandemics","interdisciplinary barriers","study of factors","list of barriers","effective application","circulation of infectious agents","better knowledge of causes","rigorous interpretation of disease dynamics","exposure","desired equilibrium","significant increase","multiple stresses","veterinary medicine","framework","zoonoses","behaviors","crosscutting perspective","importance","integrated operational initiatives","near future","epidemics","past decade","public policies","spread","biodiversity","success","ambitions"],"language":"en"},

The dimeric enzyme dissociated at guanidinium chloride concentration of \u003C0.4 M, at which the enzymatic activity loss showed close correlation with the subunit dissociation. Further increase in guanidinium chloride induced a reversible biphasic unfolding of the enzyme. The unfolding of the C-terminal domain-truncated enzyme, on the other hand, followed a monophasic unfolding curve. Different mutants of the full-length protease (W31 and W207/W218), with tryptophanyl residue(s) mutated to phenylalanine at the C-terminal or N-terminal domain, respectively, were constructed. Unfolding curves of these mutants were monophasic but corresponded to the first and second phases of the protease, respectively. The unfolding intermediate of the protease thus represented a folded C-terminal domain but an unfolded N-terminal domain, which is enzymatically inactive due to loss of regulatory properties. The various enzyme forms were characterized in terms of hydrophobicity and size-and-shape distributions. We provide direct evidence for the functional role of C-terminal domain in stabilization of the catalytic N-terminal domain of SARS coronavirus main protease.","publish_time":"2007-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Hui-Ping; Chou, Chi-Yuan; Chang, Gu-Gang","journal":"Biophysical Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e85b0f2bf56e7117395c9ebb7e41b81378f8b061.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4894e8b3062d3304ef9cc17f72efcea7e66bbe4d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a9c678f98875da168e7de9181cf521c2b84cdf4f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1783898.xml.json","url":"http://www.cell.com/article/S0006349507709487/pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349507709487; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349507709487","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chemical","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["C-terminal domain-truncated enzyme","folded C-terminal domain","unfolded N-terminal domain","catalytic N-terminal domain of SARS coronavirus main protease","dimeric enzyme","dimeric main protease","full-length protease","Unfolding curves","unfolding intermediate","enzyme activity change","monophasic unfolding curve","guanidinium chloride concentration","various enzyme forms","reversible biphasic unfolding","functional role of C","enzymatic activity loss","terms of hydrophobicity","Different mutants","terms of fluorescence spectroscopy","loss of regulatory properties","severe acute respiratory syndrome","analytical ultracentrifuge","circular dichroism","close correlation","stabilization","W218","W207","W31","hand","Chemical denaturant sensitivity","tryptophanyl residue","size","phenylalanine","subunit dissociation","direct evidence","increase","shape distributions","phases"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The data of 8,648 clusters in the TB epidemiological investigation database between 2013 and 2016 were extracted and analyzed to evaluate the indicators and perform multilevel logistic regression (MLR) analyses to identify the factors affecting each indicator. RESULTS: The rates of total LTBI diagnosis, need for treatment, treatment initiation, and treatment completion were 15.2%, 10.2%, 69.4%, and 76.6%, respectively. After adjusting for other factors on MLR, the probability of diagnosis and need for treatment of latent TB in contacts was higher in most types of facilities than in schools. Conversely, treatment completion rates in these facilities were lower. Notably, the correctional institutions showed the highest odds ratio (OR) relative to school for LTBI diagnosis (OR, 6.37) and need for treatment (OR, 4.49) and the lowest OR for treatment completion (OR, 0.10).

To address these limitations, we examined a next-generation sequencing (NGS) and iterative mapping approach for virus detection in clinical samples. We analyzed 40 clinical specimens from hospitalized children diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis, croup, or respiratory tract infections in which virus identification by viral culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was unsuccessful. For our NGS data analysis pipeline, clinical samples were pooled into two NGS groups to reduce sequencing costs, and the depth and coverage of assembled contigs were effectively increased using an iterative mapping approach. PCR was individually performed for each specimen according to the NGS-predicted viral type. We successfully detected previously unidentified respiratory viruses in 26 of 40 specimens using our proposed NGS pipeline. Two dominant populations within the detected viruses were human rhinoviruses (HRVs; n = 14) and human coronavirus NL63 (n = 8), followed by human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human parechovirus, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus. This is the first study reporting the complete genome sequences of HRV-A101, HRV-C3, HPIV-4a, and RSV, as well as an analysis of their genetic variants, in Taiwan. These results demonstrate that this NGS pipeline allows to detect viruses which were not identified by routine diagnostic assays, directly from clinical samples.

Given its significant role, business integration in general has been an enduring research topic over the years. However, due to its complex nature, the ways to achieve this important organisational capability in firms are still not clearly understood. Hence, the present study is an attempt to \u2018open this black box\u2019 and examine the relevant issues through a case study of M.com, one of the largest e-commerce firms in China. The findings of this case study emphasise that the ability to coordinate organisational interdependencies and asset orchestration according to the needs of business processes is challenging but necessary in order to achieve business integration in e-commerce firms. It is found that asset orchestration in a firm is contingent on the organisational interdependencies such that different interdependence types demand different coordination methods at the very least. It also shows the significant role of IT in asset orchestration and the coordination of organisational interdependencies during business integration. With these capabilities, firms can experience growth and improve the quality of conformance to customer needs.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Felix Ter Chian; Pan, Shan L.; Zuo, Meiyun","journal":"International Journal of Information Management","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d60943711fa959ec3b13f0838a1796b5685de9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131366.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287830/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0268401214000723; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401214000723; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.07.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["M.com"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Abstract Business integration","coordination of organisational interdependencies","asset orchestration","needs of business processes","important determinant of business value","case study of","important organisational capability","largest e-commerce firms","firm performance","significant role","present study","different coordination methods","customer needs","different interdependence types","general","ways","order","relevant issues","enduring research topic","quality of conformance","attempt","growth","black box","years","China","complex nature","competitive forces","capabilities","findings"],"language":"en"},

However, continuous global immunosuppression may cause severe side effects, including tumors and infections. Mounting evidence has shown that cyclosporine (CsA), a common immunosuppressant used in clinic, impedes allograft tolerance by dampening regulatory T cells (Tregs), although it inhibits allograft rejection at the same time. Therefore, it is necessary to seek an alternative immunosuppressive drug that spares Tregs with high efficiency in suppression but low toxicity. In this study, we investigated the capacity of emodin, an anthraquinone molecule originally extracted from certain natural plants, to prolong transplant survival in a mouse model and explored the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its action. We found that emodin significantly extended skin allograft survival and hindered CD3(\u002B) T cell infiltration in the allograft, accompanied by an increase in CD4(\u002B)Foxp3(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B)CD122(\u002B) Treg frequencies and numbers but a reduction in effector CD8(\u002B)CD44(high)CD62L(low) T cells in recipient mice. Emodin also inhibited effector CD8(\u002B) T cells proliferation in vivo. However, CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B), but not CD8(\u002B)CD122(\u002B), Tregs derived from emodin-treated recipients were more potent in suppression of allograft rejection than those isolated from control recipients, suggesting that emodin also enhances the suppressive function of CD4(\u002B)CD25(\u002B) Tregs. Interestingly, depleting CD25(\u002B) Tregs largely reversed skin allograft survival prolonged by emodin while depleting CD122(\u002B) Tregs only partially abrogated the same allograft survival. Furthermore, we found that emodin hindered dendritic cell (DC) maturation and reduced alloantibody production posttransplantation. Finally, we demonstrated that emodin inhibited in vitro proliferation of T cells and blocked their mTOR signaling as well. Therefore, emodin may be a novel mTOR inhibitor that suppresses alloimmunity by inducing both CD4(\u002B)FoxP3(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B)CD122(\u002B) Tregs, suppressing alloantibody production, and hindering DC maturation. Thus, emodin is a newly emerging immunosuppressant and could be utilized in clinical transplantation in the future.","publish_time":"2017-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qiu, Feifei; Liu, Huazhen; Liang, Chun-Ling; Nie, Golay D.; Dai, Zhenhua","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04bc03c90437934a75fc6fdc228817234ef84c3a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5682309.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.01519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29167674/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Tregs","capacity of emodin","allograft tolerance","emodin-treated recipients","suppression of allograft rejection","CD122","extended skin allograft survival","T cells proliferation","proliferation of T cells","effector CD8","regulatory T cells","T cell infiltration","transplant survival","depleting CD25","suppressive function of CD4","Foxp3","hindering DC maturation","high efficiency","low toxicity","reduced alloantibody production posttransplantation","hindered CD3","dendritic cell","control recipients","common immunosuppressant","emerging immunosuppressant","vigorous alloimmunity","alternative immunosuppressive drug","novel mTOR inhibitor","conventional immunosuppressive treatment","anthraquinone molecule","certain natural plants","effects","numbers","reduction","CD44","CD62L","mouse model","cyclosporine","CsA","Treg frequencies","recipient mice","continuous global immunosuppression","molecular mechanisms","tumors","action","increase","Mounting evidence","clinical transplantation","future","infections","time","study"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, reservoir host species are increasingly recognized besides representatives of the order Rodentia, now including members of the mammalian orders Soricomorpha/Eulipotyphla and Chiroptera. Despite the great interest created by emerging zoonotic viruses, there is still a gross lack of in vitro models, which reflect the exclusive host adaptation of most zoonotic viruses. The usually narrow host range and genetic diversity of hantaviruses make them an exciting candidate for studying virus-host interactions on a cellular level. To do so, well-characterized reservoir cell lines covering a wide range of bat, insectivore and rodent species are essential. Most currently available cell culture models display a heterologous virus-host relationship and are therefore only of limited value. Here, we review the recently established approaches to generate reservoir-derived cell culture models for the in vitro study of virus-host interactions. These successfully used model systems almost exclusively originate from bats and bat-borne viruses other than hantaviruses. Therefore we propose a parallel approach for research on rodent- and insectivore-borne hantaviruses, taking the generation of novel rodent and insectivore cell lines from wildlife species into account. These cell lines would be also valuable for studies on further rodent-borne viruses, such as orthopox- and arenaviruses.","publish_time":"2014-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eckerle, Isabella; Lenk, Matthias; Ulrich, Rainer G.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3d998de1e3cb950c425decbadc73af2c26102fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3970132.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24576845/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v6030951","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reservoir host species","insectivore cell lines","virus-host interactions","rodent species","narrow host range","identified viruses","reservoir-derived cell culture models","available cell culture models","heterologous virus-host relationship","exclusive host adaptation","emerging zoonotic viruses","well-characterized reservoir cell lines","generation of novel rodent","study of virus","wildlife species","wide range of bat","genetic diversity of hantaviruses","members","mammalian orders Soricomorpha","exciting candidate","Eulipotyphla","Chiroptera","high-throughput detection methods","plethora","bats","research","representatives","account","studies","established approaches","cellular level","order Rodentia","parallel approach","genus Hantavirus","gross lack of","model systems","orthopox","limited value","arenaviruses"],"language":"en"},

We assessed the management of RSV and other non\u2010influenza respiratory viruses in Midwestern transplant centers. METHODS: A survey assessing strategies for RSV and other non\u2010influenza respiratory viral infections was sent to 13 centers. RESULTS: Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay was used for diagnosis in 11/12 centers. Eight of 12 centers used inhaled ribavirin (RBV) in some patient populations. Barriers included cost, safety, lack of evidence, and inconvenience. Six of 12 used intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), mostly in combination with RBV. Inhaled RBV was used more than oral, and in the post\u2010stem cell transplant population, patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease, and more recent transplantation were treated at higher rates. Ten centers had experience with lung transplant patients; all used either oral or inhaled RBV for LRTI, 6/10 treated upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). No center treated non\u2010lung solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with URTI; 7/11 would use oral or inhaled RBV in the same group with LRTI. Patients with hematologic malignancy without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were treated with RBV at a similar frequency to non\u2010lung SOT recipients. Three of 12 centers, in severe cases, treated parainfluenza and metapneumovirus, and 1/12 treated coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of RSV in immunocompromised patients varied greatly. While most centers treat LRTI, treatment of URTI was variable. No consensus was found regarding the use of oral versus inhaled RBV, or the use of IVIG. The presence of such heterogeneity demonstrates the need for further studies defining optimal treatment of RSV in immunocompromised hosts.","publish_time":"2016-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beaird, O.E.; Freifeld, A.; Ison, M.G.; Lawrence, S.J.; Theodoropoulos, N.; Clark, N.M.; Razonable, R.R.; Alangaden, G.; Miller, R.; Smith, J.; Young, J.A.H.; Hawkinson, D.; Pursell, K.; Kaul, D.R.","journal":"Transpl Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9218840f09ab009a056978207047059cadc2c27.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169710.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.12510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26923867/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","RBV","URTI","LRTI","SOT","IVIG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Inhaled RBV","lung transplant patients","LRTI","Midwestern transplant centers","optimal treatment of RSV","treatment of URTI","treated parainfluenza","use of oral","treated coronavirus","treated upper respiratory tract infection","non\u2010influenza respiratory viruses","management of RSV","adult immunocompromised patients","inhaled ribavirin","lower respiratory tract infection","non\u2010lung SOT recipients","non\u2010influenza respiratory viral infections","non\u2010lung solid organ transplant","use of IVIG","respiratory syncytial virus","post\u2010stem cell transplant population","immunocompromised hosts","hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","recent transplantation","metapneumovirus","hematologic malignancy","similar frequency","Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay","RESULTS","need","graft","severe cases","studies","strategies","lack of evidence","cost","safety","host disease","diagnosis","experience","Barriers","heterogeneity","higher rates","survey","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","group","patient populations","presence","inconvenience","METHODS","intravenous immunoglobulin","combination","consensus"],"language":"en"},

Although sustained or repeated stress can result in severe deleterious physiological effects, the causes of stress in free-ranging animals are yet poorly documented. In our study, we aimed at identifying the main factors affecting stress levels in free-ranging wolves (Canis lupus). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) as an index of stress, after validating the method for its application in wolves. We analyzed a total of 450 fecal samples from eleven wolf packs belonging to three protected populations, in Italy (Abruzzo), France (Mercantour), and the United States (Yellowstone). We collected samples during two consecutive winters in each study area. We found no relationship between FCM concentrations and age, sex or social status of individuals. At the group level, our results suggest that breeding pair permanency and the loss of pack members through processes different from dispersal may importantly impact stress levels in wolves. We measured higher FCM levels in comparatively small packs living in sympatry with a population of free-ranging dogs. Lastly, our results indicate that FCM concentrations are associated with endoparasitic infections of individuals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In social mammals sharing strong bonds among group members, the death of one or several members of the group most likely induces important stress in the remainder of the social unit. The potential impact of social and territorial stability on stress levels should be further investigated in free-ranging populations, especially in highly social and in territorial species. As persistent or repeated stressors may facilitate or induce pathologies and physiological alterations that can affect survival and fitness, we advocate considering the potential impact of anthropogenic causes of stress in management and conservation programs regarding wolves and other wildlife.","publish_time":"2015-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Molnar, Barbara; Fattebert, Julien; Palme, Rupert; Ciucci, Paolo; Betschart, Bruno; Smith, Douglas W.; Diehl, Peter-Allan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73560247ea59c1db0dd80dc9022c7d6795f7d671.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4580640.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26398784/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FCM"],"locations":["France","United States"],"keyphrases":["stress levels","important stress","index of stress","wolves","potential impact of social","potential impact of anthropogenic causes of stress","social mammals","FCM concentrations","higher FCM levels","social unit","group members","social status of individuals","population of free","physiological alterations","fecal samples","results","group level","animals","loss of pack members","wolf packs","small packs","severe deleterious physiological effects","territorial stability","protected populations","territorial species","repeated stressors","study area","fecal cortisol metabolites","endoparasitic infections of individuals","strong bonds","management","sex","dispersal","processes different","conservation programs","breeding pair permanency","Abruzzo","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","Mercantour","Italy","consecutive winters","SIGNIFICANCE","pathologies","sympatry","remainder","death","main factors","United States","France","fitness","survival","wildlife","CONCLUSIONS","relationship","Canis lupus","behavioral responses","Yellowstone","METHODOLOGY","application","dogs","total","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The goal of this study is to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the Egyptian public towards the COVID-19 disease. We conducted a cross-sectional survey about these points, which was distributed among adult Egyptians. Five hundred and fifty nine persons completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 16.39 out of 23, gained mainly though social media (66.9%), and the internet (58.3%). Knowledge was significantly lower among older, less educated, lower income participants, and rural residents. Most participants (86.9%) were concerned about the risk of infection. While 37.6% thought that their salary will be continued if they become isolated, 68.5% believed that it should be continued during this period. About 73.0% were looking forward to get the vaccine when available. In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures. This knowledge is gained mainly through novel media channels, which have pros and cons. Although the government has taken major steps to educate the public and limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to educate and support the lower economic strata.

Questions exist regarding the suitability and validity of these sources. AIM: We conducted a systematic review to identify the sources of airline passenger data used for these purposes and to assess validation of the data and reproducibility of the methodology. METHODS: Articles matching our search criteria and describing a model of the international spread of human infectious disease, parameterised with airline passenger data, were identified. Information regarding type and source of airline passenger data used was collated and the studies\u2019 reproducibility assessed. RESULTS: We identified 136 articles. The majority (n = 96) sourced data primarily used by the airline industry. Governmental data sources were used in 30 studies and data published by individual airports in four studies. Validation of passenger data was conducted in only seven studies. No study was found to be fully reproducible, although eight were partially reproducible. LIMITATIONS: By limiting the articles to international spread, articles focussed on within-country transmission even if they used relevant data sources were excluded. Authors were not contacted to clarify their methods. Searches were limited to articles in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. CONCLUSION: We recommend greater efforts to assess validity and biases of airline passenger data used for modelling studies, particularly when model outputs are to inform national and international public health policies. We also recommend improving reporting standards and more detailed studies on biases in commercial and open-access data to assess their reproducibility.","publish_time":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mesl\u00E9, Margaux Marie Isabelle; Hall, Ian Melvyn; Christley, Robert Matthew; Leach, Steve; Read, Jonathan Michael","journal":"Euro Surveill","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c71d6e115ba17a5b6263cf65de99c7c0fa7d487a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6685100.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2019.24.31.1800216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31387671/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sources of airline passenger data","Validation of passenger data","biases of airline passenger data","sourced data","source of airline passenger data","variety of airline passenger data sources","relevant data sources","Governmental data sources","Articles","open-access data","airline industry","modelling studies","detailed studies","international spread of infectious diseases","international spread of human infectious disease","validity","studies\u2019 reproducibility","METHODS","international public health policies","model outputs","PubMed","type","greater efforts","Web of Science","search criteria","individual airports","purposes","reporting standards","systematic review","country transmission","Scopus","Information","suitability","BACKGROUND","AIM","CONCLUSION","majority","Questions","Searches","methodology","study","RESULTS","LIMITATIONS","Authors"],"language":"en"},

It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th(,) 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Biao; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Li, Qian; Tang, Sanyi; Xiao, Yanni; Wu, Jianhong","journal":"Infect Dis Model","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab854568981d35b1da78cccdaf67b6cfd7ac0046.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6b6a3e24c4812ea75232742d0fdd0a4020289ce6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7029158.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32099934/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S246804272030004X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246804272030004X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs0NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["peak time","basic reproduction number","dynamics of transmission","effective daily reproduction ratio","coronavirus outbreak","novel coronavirus","transmission risk","infectious period","average number of infections","nCoV","estimation period","time-dependent contact","epidemics","proposed dynamics transmission model","new coronavirus cases","infectious agent","case reporting rate","public health interventions","best measure","choice of parameters","utilized models","previous estimations","different assumptions","faster confirmation","diagnosis","datasets","strict self-isolation","data available","symptoms onset","introduction of detection technologies","methodological issues","thanks","rates","significant variations","control strategies","updated findings","course","evolution","uninfected population","spreading"],"language":"en"},

Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses.

However, the factors leading to lung pathology are not well understood. Using mice infected with SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)-CoV, we show that robust virus replication accompanied by delayed type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling orchestrates inflammatory responses and lung immunopathology with diminished survival. IFN-I remains detectable until after virus titers peak but early IFN-I administration ameliorates immunopathology. This delayed IFN-I signaling promotes the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages (IMMs), resulting in elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels, vascular leakage and impaired virus-specific T cell responses. Genetic ablation of the IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 receptor (IFNAR) or IMM depletion protects mice from lethal infection, without affecting viral load. These results demonstrate that IFN-I and IMM promote lethal SARS-CoV infection and identify IFN-I and IMMs as potential therapeutic targets in patients infected with pathogenic coronavirus and perhaps other respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Fehr, Anthony R; Vijay, Rahul; Mack, Matthias; Zhao, Jincun; Meyerholz, David K; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"Cell Host \u0026 Microbe","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4716a579e28eeb0550a0c53ceda0ee315b08616.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2324f5b1db825c2cf1a0d6db97830ea4435b072d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/122217a5acb7db58b8a283eec4208078fc04c551.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3c1fd7af000bb8b9942bb7ececa7bb0bee485513.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4752723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26867177/; http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312816300063/pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312816300063; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312816300063; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2016.01.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IMM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["delayed IFN","early IFN","IFN-\u03B1\u03B2 receptor","lung immunopathology","lethal infection","lung damage","lung pathology","exuberant inflammatory responses","lethal SARS-CoV infection","acute lethal disease","IMMs","pathogenic coronavirus","pathogenic human respiratory coronaviruses","elevated lung cytokine","respiratory viruses","mice","accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","impaired virus-specific T cell responses","virus titers peak","robust virus replication","IMM depletion","delayed type","vascular leakage","chemokine levels","patients","IFNAR","potential therapeutic targets","diminished survival","interferon","administration","Genetic ablation","viral load","factors","results"],"language":"en"},

We demonstrated that porcine kobuvirus infections exist in indigenous pigs in Kenya and Uganda and that the prevalence was higher in young piglets than older pigs: nursing piglets (15 %), post-weaning (3-month-old) pigs (17 %), 4-month-old pigs (10 %). Genetic analysis of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region (690 nt) revealed that kobuviruses circulating in East Africa are diverse, sharing nucleotide sequence identities ranging from 89.7 to 99.1 % and 88 to 92.3 % among them and with known porcine kobuviruses, respectively. The nucleotide sequence identities between our kobuvirus strains and those of human, bovine and canine kobuviruses were 69.4-70.7 %, 73.1-74.4 % and 67-70.7 %, respectively. Additionally, upon sequencing selected samples that showed consistent 720-bp RT-PCR bands while using the same primer set, we detected porcine astroviruses in our samples belonging to type 2 and type 3 mamastroviruses.

To determine if the ferret badgers actually contribute to human and dog rabies cases, and the possible origin of the ferret badger-associated rabies in the region, an active rabies survey was conducted to determine the frequency of rabies infection and seroprevalence in dogs and ferret badgers. METHODS: A retrospective survey on rabies epidemics was performed in Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces in southeast China. The brain tissues from ferret badgers and dogs were assayed by fluorescent antibody test. Rabies virus was isolated and sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. The sera from ferret badgers and dogs were titrated using rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (VNA) test. RESULTS: The ferret badgers presented a higher percentage of rabies seroconversion than dogs did in the endemic region, reaching a maximum of 95% in the collected samples. Nine ferret badger-associated rabies viruses were isolated, sequenced, and were phylogenetically clustered as a separate group. Nucleotide sequence revealed 99.4-99.8% homology within the ferret badger isolates, and 83-89% homology to the dog isolates in the nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes in the same rabies endemic regions. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest ferret badger-associated rabies has likely formed as an independent enzootic originating from dogs during the long-term rabies infestation in southeast China. The eventual role of FB rabies in public health remains unclear. However, management of ferret badger bites, rabies awareness and control in the related regions should be an immediate need.","publish_time":"2010-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Ye; Zhang, Shoufeng; Wu, Xianfu; Zhao, Jinghui; Hou, Yanli; Zhang, Fei; Velasco-Villa, Andres; Rupprecht, Charles E; Hu, Rongliang","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb6bcd87e93e2bac6bd7b03367102b0a05e458e3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2927599.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20691095/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-10-234","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FB"],"locations":["China","Jiangxi","Anhui"],"keyphrases":["rabies awareness","rabies epidemics","rabies transmission","ferret badgers","ferret badger-associated rabies viruses","human rabies cases","dog rabies cases","rabies endemic regions","active rabies survey","ferret badger isolates","long-term rabies infestation","frequency of rabies infection","dogs","higher percentage of rabies seroconversion","eventual role of FB rabies","management of ferret badger bites","frequent occurrence of ferret badger","southeast China","dog isolates","homology","related regions","retrospective survey","fluorescent antibody test","Jiangxi","glycoprotein genes","control","seroprevalence","possible origin","public health","lack of laboratory","potential importance","Zhejiang","Anhui provinces","data","based surveillance","independent enzootic originating","nucleoprotein","animal","antibodies","VNA","brain tissues","immediate need","maximum","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","sera","phylogenetic analysis","separate group","RESULTS","collected samples","Nucleotide sequence"],"language":"en"},

The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between IgE reactivity to the vaccines and immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs. Sera from 10 dogs that developed immediate-type allergic reactions such as circulatory collapse, cyanosis, dyspnea, facial edema, and vomiting within 1h after vaccination with non-rabies monovalent or combined vaccines and sera from 50 dogs that did not develop allergic reactions after vaccination were collected. Serum IgE reactivity to the injected vaccines was measured by fluorometric ELISA using a mouse monoclonal anti-dog IgE antibody. Then, IgE reactivity to fetal calf serum (FCS) and stabilizer proteins (gelatin, casein, and peptone) included in the vaccines was measured in sera that had high levels of IgE to the vaccines. Levels of serum specific IgE to the vaccines in dogs with immediate-type allergic reactions (59\u20134173 fluorescence units [FU], mean\u00B1S.D.: 992.5\u00B11181.9 FU) were significantly higher than those in control dogs (38\u2013192 FU, 92.4\u00B143.3 FU) (P \u003C0.001). Of the eight dogs that developed immediate-type allergic reactions and had high levels of serum specific IgE to the vaccines, seven had specific IgE directed to FCS. The IgE reactivity to the vaccines in sera from these dogs was almost completely inhibited by FCS. The other one dog had serum IgE directed to gelatin and casein included in the vaccine as stabilizers. The results obtained in this study suggest that immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs were induced by type I hypersensitivity mediated by IgE directed to vaccine components. In addition, FCS, gelatin, and casein included in vaccines could be the causative allergens that induced immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs.","publish_time":"2005-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ohmori, Keitaro; Masuda, Kenichi; Maeda, Sadatoshi; Kaburagi, Yukiko; Kurata, Keigo; Ohno, Koichi; DeBoer, Douglas J.; Tsujimoto, Hajime; Sakaguchi, Masahiro","journal":"Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f5178ce2d794179ff80ad8f2d31af2c8a975853.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112531.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242704003411; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242704003411","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":["FCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immediate-type allergic reactions","Serum IgE reactivity","vaccination","Abstract Allergic reactions","control dogs","high levels of IgE","combined vaccines","injected vaccines","high levels of serum specific IgE","Sera","FCS","FU","gelatin","casein","mouse monoclonal anti-dog IgE antibody","fetal calf serum","vaccine components","present study","non-rabies monovalent","fluorometric ELISA","circulatory collapse","cyanosis","stabilizer proteins","dyspnea","causative allergens","facial edema","relationship","important practical problem","fluorescence units","peptone","hypersensitivity","stabilizers","immunological mechanism","addition","results"],"language":"en"},

This harmonisation seems natural and logical in the current environment of increased globalisation imposed by the current geo-economic-political situation. However, even though this is a reality, it is important to analyse whether or not all stakeholders benefit from this increased cooperation and harmonisation, in order to recommend future actions or potential improvements. Cooperation, convergence and harmonisation is indeed not an end in itself. Elimination of differences, agreement on common standards and the increase of cooperation are needed to protect and promote global public health. It is therefore very important to thoroughly analyse the value and impact of the harmonisation and cooperation process, and to determine whether or not all the efforts made throughout the years have indeed met expectations. After many years of experience, it seems important to have a thorough evaluation to answer several important questions: \u25B8 What has been the benefit of the multiple harmonisation and cooperation initiatives so far? \u25B8 Should such processes continue? Are there any other alternatives to resolve current challenges? \u25B8 Should current initiatives and projects be improved? If so, how and what are the priorities? \u25B8 Would greater harmonisation and closer cooperation be beneficial? Is it possible? Is it necessary? What are the limits of this process? \u25B8 What are the important lessons from the past and the on-going harmonisation initiatives that should be considered for planning the next steps? This book section\u2019s goal is to answer these important questions by thoroughly evaluating the added value of cooperation, convergence and harmonisation. This book section also reviews the critical parameters and influencing factors for cooperation, convergence and harmonisation. This review/analysis of critical parameters and influencing factors is essential to understand the complexity of the situation and effectively discuss how to organise the next steps of global cooperation.","publish_time":"2014-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lezotre, Pierre-Louis","journal":"International Cooperation, Convergence and Harmonization of Pharmaceutical Regulations","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128000533000033; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128000533000033","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs1NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["harmonisation initiatives","cooperation initiatives","increased cooperation","harmonisation of standards","cooperation process","greater harmonisation","increase of cooperation","closer cooperation","multiple harmonisation","Abstract Cooperation","steps of global cooperation","important questions","added value of cooperation","important lessons","convergence","current challenges","factors","current environment of increased globalisation","reality","current geo-economic-political situation","analysis of critical parameters","common standards","stakeholders benefit","years of experience","book section\u2019s goal","global public health","order","agreement","future actions","pharmaceutical domain","thorough evaluation","impact","potential improvements","Elimination of differences","complexity","review","alternatives","recent decades","efforts","expectations","limits","projects","end","processes","priorities"],"language":"en"},

Their replication complexes are commonly associated with modified host cell membranes. Membrane structures supporting viral RNA synthesis range from distinct spherular membrane invaginations to more elaborate webs of packed membranes and vesicles. Generally, their ultrastructure, morphogenesis, and exact role in viral replication remain to be defined. Poorly characterized double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) were previously implicated in SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. We have now applied electron tomography of cryofixed infected cells for the three-dimensional imaging of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations at high resolution. Our analysis defines a unique reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum that integrates convoluted membranes, numerous interconnected DMVs (diameter 200\u2013300 nm), and \u201Cvesicle packets\u201D apparently arising from DMV merger. The convoluted membranes were most abundantly immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits. However, double-stranded RNA, presumably revealing the site of viral RNA synthesis, mainly localized to the DMV interior. Since we could not discern a connection between DMV interior and cytosol, our analysis raises several questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. Our data document the extensive virus-induced reorganization of host cell membranes into a network that is used to organize viral replication and possibly hide replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms.

This infectious disease results in significant losses in the swine industry and specific anti-PRRSV drugs are needed. In this study, we evaluated a novel class of antisense compounds, peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (P-PMOs), for their ability to suppress PRRSV replication in cell culture. P-PMOs are analogs of single-stranded DNA and contain a modified backbone that confers highly specific binding to RNA and resistance to nucleases. Of six P-PMOs tested, one (\u20185UP1\u2019), with sequence complementary to the 5\u2032-terminal 21 nucleotides of the PRRSV genome, was found to be highly effective at reducing PRRSV replication in a specific and dose-dependent manner in CRL11171 cells in culture. 5UP1 treatment generated up to a 4.5log reduction in infectious PRRSV yield, while a control P-PMO had no effect on viral titer. Immunofluorescence assay with an anti-PRRSV monoclonal antibody confirmed the titer observations. The sequence-specificity of 5UP1 effect was confirmed in part by a cell-free luciferase reporter assay system, which showed that 5UP1-mediated inhibition of translation decreased if the target-RNA contained mispairings in relation to the 5UP1 P-PMO. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the production of PRRSV negative-sense RNA was reduced if 5UP1 was added to cells at up to 6h post-virus inoculation. Cell viability assays detected no cytotoxicity of 5UP1 within the concentration-range of this study. These results indicate that P-PMO 5UP1 has potential as an anti-PRRSV agent.","publish_time":"2006-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yan-Jin; Stein, David A.; Fan, Su-Min; Wang, Kai-Yu; Kroeker, Andrew D.; Meng, Xiang-Jin; Iversen, Patrick L.; Matson, David O.","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/961707d946be05fab753ad40e23c861e98231a9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117520.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113506002148; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113506002148","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs2NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["5UP1 P-PMO","P-PMO 5UP1","PRRSV replication","PRRSV genome","5UP1 effect","anti-PRRSV agent","cytotoxicity of 5UP1","P-PMOs","5UP1 treatment","specific anti-PRRSV drugs","infectious PRRSV yield","anti-PRRSV monoclonal antibody","control P-PMO","production of PRRSV negative-sense RNA","5UP1-mediated inhibition of translation","respiratory disease","cell culture","infectious disease results","specific binding","contagious disease","target-RNA","study","respiratory syndrome virus","Cell viability assays","reproductive failure","Immunofluorescence assay","cell-free luciferase reporter assay system","CRL11171 cells","titer observations","causative agent","viral titer","sequence complementary","sequence-specificity","h post-virus inoculation","swine industry","peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers","significant losses","dose-dependent manner","sows","novel class of antisense compounds","relation","stranded DNA","potential","modified backbone","analogs of single","mispairings","log reduction","terminal","resistance","concentration-range","Real-time RT-PCR","nucleases","piglets","nucleotides"],"language":"en"},

Most RSV inpatients had pneumonia (84.1%), of whom 35% had severe pneumonia. Children \u003C3-months old were a high-risk group for severe pneumonia, independently of RSV infection. Our study suggests that RSV infection is frequent in Laos and commonly associated with pneumonia in hospitalized young children. Further investigations are required to provide a better overall view of the Lao nationwide epidemiology and public health burden of RSV infection over time.","publish_time":"2017-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nguyen, Van Hoan; Dubot-P\u00E9r\u00E8s, Audrey; Russell, Fiona M.; Dance, David A.

This issue has received more and more attentions from academics. This work investigates the influence of human movement on the airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases in an airplane cabin by using an accurate human model in numerical simulation and comparing the influences of different human movement behaviors on disease transmission. METHODS: The Eulerian\u2013Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols. The dose\u2013response model is used to assess the infection risks of the occupants. The likelihood analysis is performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and different human movement pattern assumptions. An in-flight SARS outbreak case is used for investigation. A moving person with different moving speeds is simulated to represent the movement behaviors. A digital human model was used to represent the detailed profile of the occupants, which was obtained by scanning a real thermal manikin using the 3D laser scanning system. RESULTS: The analysis results indicate that human movement can strengthen the downward transport of the aerosols, significantly reduce the overall deposition and removal rate of the suspended aerosols and increase the average infection risk in the cabin. The likelihood estimation result shows that the risk assessment results better fit the outcome of the outbreak case when the movements of the seated passengers are considered. The intake fraction of the moving person is significantly higher than most of the seated passengers. CONCLUSIONS: The infection risk distribution in the airplane cabin highly depends on the movement behaviors of the passengers and the index patient. The walking activities of the crew members and the seated passengers can significantly increase their personal infection risks. Taking the influence of the movement of the seated passengers and the index patient into consideration is necessary and important. For future studies, investigations on the behaviors characteristics of the passengers during flight will be useful and helpful for infection control.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Among a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed. Data were collected until 28 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms. RESULTS: The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years). Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)). Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)). The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Tao; Wu, Di; Chen, Huilong; Yan, Weiming; Yang, Danlei; Chen, Guang; Ma, Ke; Xu, Dong; Yu, Haijing; Wang, Hongwu; Wang, Tao; Guo, Wei; Chen, Jia; Ding, Chen; Zhang, Xiaoping; Huang, Jiaquan; Han, Meifang; Li, Shusheng; Luo, Xiaoping; Zhao, Jianping; Ning, Qin","journal":"BMJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f3f4bb01d3c561aebd65c4a1e8d4a1b879ed3e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190011.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32217556/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1091","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["recovered patients","clinical characteristics of patients","median age of deceased patients","acute cardiac injury","respiratory failure","acute respiratory distress syndrome","heart failure","cardiac complications","acute kidney injury","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Common complications","cardiac troponin","common critical complications","coronavirus disease","history of cardiovascular disease","disease onset","cardiovascular comorbidities","cardiovascular comorbidity","sepsis","exacerbation of covid","years","diagnosis of covid","aspartate aminotransferase","median time","Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase","data collection forms","creatinine","creatine kinase","N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide","laboratory findings","infection","electronic medical records","lactate dehydrogenase","multi-organ dysfunction","D-dimer","death","disorder of consciousness","systemic inflammation","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES","CONCLUSION","high risk","Tongji Hospital","Wuhan","chest tightness","interquartile range","Male sex","DESIGN","Retrospective case series","SETTING","China","Dyspnoea","Chronic hypertension","RESULTS","days","OBJECTIVE","cohort","hypoxic encephalopathy","PARTICIPANTS","Leukocytosis","lymphopenia","alkalosis","hyperkalaemia"],"language":"en"},

Treatment with mupirocin can eradicate the organism in the short term, and prophylactic treatment of colonized patients may prevent postoperative S. aureus infections. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine whether nasal mupirocin administered pre-operatively to S. aureus carriers reduces the rates of sternal and leg wound infections after cardiac surgery. The study enrolled 263 patients with nasal S. aureus undergoing elective cardiac surgery at St. Michael\u0027s Hospital, Toronto, Canada. Patients were assessed for infections in the immediate postoperative period and two months later. Two hundred and fifty-seven patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and re-analysed according to the actual treatment applied. Wound infections occurred in 17 (13.5%) mupirocin recipients and 11 (9.1%) placebo recipients (P =0.319), with seven (5.4%) and six (4.7%) sternal infections, respectively. Two (1.6%) wound infections were acquired postoperatively in the mupirocin group, neither of which were caused by S. aureus. The placebo group had three (2.4%) nosocomial wound infections, with two (1.6%) S. aureus bacteraemias (P =0.243).

Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600 mg twice daily; Days 2\u201314: 600 mg twice daily) plus interferon (IFN)-\u03B1 by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the FPV arm of this study, whereas patients who were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1\u201314: 400 mg/100 mg twice daily) plus IFN-\u03B1 by aerosol inhalation (5 million U twice daily) were included in the control arm. Changes in chest computed tomography (CT), viral clearance, and drug safety were compared between the two groups. For the 35 patients enrolled in the FPV arm and the 45 patients in the control arm, all baseline characteristics were comparable between the two arms. A shorter viral clearance time was found for the FPV arm versus the control arm (median (interquartile range, IQR), 4 (2.5\u20139) d versus 11 (8\u201313) d, P \u003C 0.001). The FPV arm also showed significant improvement in chest imaging compared with the control arm, with an improvement rate of 91.43% versus 62.22% (P = 0.004). After adjustment for potential confounders, the FPV arm also showed a significantly higher improvement rate in chest imaging. Multivariable Cox regression showed that FPV was independently associated with faster viral clearance. In addition, fewer adverse reactions were found in the FPV arm than in the control arm. In this open-label nonrandomized control study, FPV showed significantly better treatment effects on COVID-19 in terms of disease progression and viral clearance; if causal, these results should be important information for establishing standard treatment guidelines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cai, Qingxian; Yang, Minghui; Liu, Dongjing; Chen, Jun; Shu, Dan; Xia, Junxia; Liao, Xuejiao; Gu, Yuanbo; Cai, Qiue; Yang, Yang; Shen, Chenguang; Li, Xiaohe; Peng, Ling; Huang, Deliang; Zhang, Jing; Zhang, Shurong; Wang, Fuxiang; Liu, Jiaye; Chen, Li; Chen, Shuyan; Wang, Zhaoqin; Zhang, Zheng; Cao, Ruiyuan; Zhong, Wu; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei","journal":"Engineering (Beijing)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/995847926bde7c0022c3c2b8ac9f3f84756c221d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185795.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809920300631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346491/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095809920300631","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Multivariable Cox"],"organizations":["FPV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["FPV arm","control arm","oral FPV","patients","treatment of COVID","faster viral clearance","chest imaging","shorter viral clearance time","specific treatment","better treatment effects","open-label nonrandomized control study","SARS-CoV","significant improvement","standard treatment guidelines","higher improvement rate","aerosol inhalation","IFN-\u03B1","infection","LPV","RTV","Days","acute respiratory distress syndrome","outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","chest computed tomography","caused coronavirus disease","effects of Favipiravir","terms of disease progression","median","important information","causal","interquartile range","baseline characteristics","Changes","results","fewer adverse reactions","Lopinavir","ritonavir","potential confounders","fatality ratio","drug safety","addition","IQR","Multivariable Cox regression","adjustment","arms","interferon","laboratory","groups","China"],"language":"en"},

This may also occur inside host cells. Viral proteinases are produced during propagation inside host cells to supply amino acids for rapid synthesis of viral proteins, and/or to split poly-protein molecules into single protein molecules, e.g., capside, and matrix and/or envelope proteins. In host cells the most profound, microbial proteinase-mediated effect is thought to be damage of the mitochondria, the site of oxidative energy generation. Two major effects can be imagined: (i) damage of proteinase-susceptible extra-mitochondrial membrane-associated proteins (razor blade effect), e.g., of mitochondrial transport proteins and of ATP:ADP translocase, and (ii) damage of intra-mitochondrial proteinase-susceptible proteins that are involved in the energy-generating processes. Although proteinases are not thought to invade and destroy mitochondria and essential intra-mitochondrial structures involved in energy generation, they can destroy non-mitochondrial encoded mitochondrial proteins during transport to the mitochondria, i.e., before incorporation inside the mitochondria in intra-mitochondrial structures. A secondary effect may be damage of liver cells that effect hepatic gluconeogenesis, the process that is involved in the synthesis of glucose from lactic acid. The proteinase may bring about inactivation of specific gluconeogenesis enzymes. This means that accumulated amounts of lactic acid cannot rapidly be reduced and consequently, such inactivation will increase intracellular and later even systemic acidification that may finally result in death. We postulate that both direct and indirect proteinase-mediated damage of mitochondria and gluconeogenesis enzymes, and consequently of human cellular energy generation, is an essential element in acute (e.g., influenza) and chronic (e.g., hepatitis B) intracellular infections.","publish_time":"2008-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bongaerts, Ger P.A.; van den Heuvel, Lambert P.","journal":"Medical Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9ff14ddc68468e06b5ee4160388f179e9d09612.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131153.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698770700477X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030698770700477X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mitochondrial transport proteins","damage of proteinase","damage of intra-mitochondrial proteinase-susceptible proteins","non-mitochondrial encoded mitochondrial proteins","indirect proteinase-mediated damage of mitochondria","essential intra-mitochondrial structures","envelope proteins","host cells","susceptible extra-mitochondrial membrane-associated proteins","microbial proteinase-mediated effect","rapid synthesis of viral proteins","liver cells","Viral proteinases","secondary effect","human cellular energy generation","site of oxidative energy generation","hepatic gluconeogenesis","razor blade effect","inactivation of specific gluconeogenesis enzymes","extracellular proteinases","single protein molecules","poly-protein molecules","essential element","synthesis of glucose","intracellular infections","accumulated amounts of lactic acid","amino acids","ATP","propagation","hepatitis B","aminoacids","bacteria","fungi","capside","ADP translocase","incorporation","influenza","Summary","matrix","optimal reproduction","systemic acidification","major effects","death","processes"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, the consecutive circulation of CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 in wild carnivores maintained in a French zoological park is reported. A fatal CAdV-1 infection was observed in a Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus), which displayed gross lesions, histopathological changes and immunohistochemical findings suggestive of CAdV-1 infection. The virus was isolated on cell cultures and its genome was determined through next-generation sequencing, resulting genetically related to a recent Italian CAdV-1 strain detected in an Italian wolf. Subsequently, subclinical circulation of CAdV-2 was demonstrated by molecular methods in wild carnivores maintained in the same zoological park, some of which had been previously vaccinated with a CAdV-2 vaccine. Virus detection at a long distance from vaccination and by unvaccinated animals was suggestive of infection by a CAdV-2 field strain, although no data are available about the extent and duration of shedding of CAdV-2 modified-live virus in wild or domestic carnivores.

In the present study, the association between KI/WUPyV infection and immunosuppression was investigated using sequential nasopharyngeal aspirates from asymptomatic adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. In parallel, an investigation on the WU/KIPyV prevalence in children with acute respiratory disease was also carried out. Two of the 126 samples obtained from the 31 hematopoietic transplant recipients were positive for KIPyV (1 sample, 0.79%) and WUPyV (1 sample, 0.79%). Both samples were obtained 15 days after allogeneic transplantation and virus persistence was not observed in subsequent samples. In symptomatic children, 7 of the 486 nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for WUPyV (1.4%) and 1 for KIPyV (0.2%).

The most frequently detected viruses were RSV (30.4%) and Rhinovirus (27.4%). RSV exhibited a clear seasonality with marked peaks in January/February, while rhinovirus infections did not exhibit a pronounced seasonality being detected almost throughout the year. While RSV and PIV3 incidence decreased significantly with age, the opposite was observed for influenza A and B as well as adenovirus infections.

The coronavirus referred to as PED virus (PEDV) was determined to be the etiologic agent of this disease in the late 1970s. Since then the disease has been reported in Europe and Asia, but the most severe outbreaks have occurred predominantly in Asian swine-producing countries. Most recently, PED first emerged in early 2013 in the United States that caused high morbidity and mortality associated with PED, remarkably affecting US pig production, and spread further to Canada and Mexico. Soon thereafter, large-scale PED epidemics recurred through the pork industry in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. These recent outbreaks and global re-emergence of PED require urgent attention and deeper understanding of PEDV biology and pathogenic mechanisms. This paper highlights the current knowledge of molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of PEDV, as well as prevention and control measures against PEDV infection. More information about the virus and the disease is still necessary for the development of effective vaccines and control strategies. It is hoped that this review will stimulate further basic and applied studies and encourage collaboration among producers, researchers, and swine veterinarians to provide answers that improve our understanding of PEDV and PED in an effort to eliminate this economically significant viral disease, which emerged or re-emerged worldwide.","publish_time":"2015-12-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Changhee","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a672930b5dc73b6002ca4a697e2109b130dee042.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4687282.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26689811/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0421-2","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYzLmNzdjs4NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1694876,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G1bVlEnkOHV\u002BpUHsdmwlBw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_63.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PED","PEDV"],"locations":["Europe","Asia","United States","Canada","Mexico","South Korea","Japan"],"keyphrases":["PED virus","global re-emergence of PED","pathogenesis of PEDV","PEDV infection","large-scale PED epidemics","enteric disease of swine","significant viral disease","deeper understanding of PEDV biology","swine veterinarians","Asian swine","epidemic viral diarrhea","Europe","porcine epidemic diarrhea","control strategies","control measures","recent outbreaks","severe outbreaks","urgent attention","pork industry","producers","diagnosis","development of effective vaccines","current knowledge of molecular epidemiology","collaboration","South Korea","Japan","high morbidity","prevention","applied studies","pathogenic mechanisms","researchers","mortality","answers","effort","United States","US pig production","Taiwan","paper","etiologic agent","Canada","review","countries","information","coronavirus","Mexico"],"language":"en"},

NxTAG RPP gave sensitivity of 95.2%, specificity of 99.6%, PPV of 93.5%, and NPV of 99.7%. NxTAG RPP, xTAG RVP, and FilmArray RP had highly concordant performance among each other for the detection of respiratory pathogens. The mean analytic sensitivity (TCID50/ml) of NxTAG RPP, xTAG RVP, and FilmArray RP for detection of swine/avian-origin influenza A subtype isolates was 0.7, 41.8, and 0.8, respectively. All three multiplex assays correctly typed and genotyped the influenza viruses, except for NxTAG RRP that could not distinguish H3N2 from H3N2v. Further investigation should be performed if H3N2v is suspected to be the cause of disease. Sensitive and specific laboratory diagnosis of all influenza A viruses subtypes is especially essential in certain epidemic regions, such as Southeast Asia.

This vegetation is represented by some species of herbaceous or woody plants, annual or perennial, that spontaneously invade the agricultural lands, diminishing the production capacity of the cultivated plants.

Its rapid propagation and resistance to acaricides make it control difficult in the sub-region and Benin particularly. The aim of this work was to check its presence in wildlife and to confirm the possible role of reservoir wildlife may play in the propagation of the parasite. This will help to design more efficient control strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted from February to March 2017 in the National Parks of Benin (Pendjari and W Park) and wildfowl\u2019s assembly and selling point in Benin. Ticks were manually picked with forceps from each animal after slaughtering by hunters then stored in 70\u00B0 ethanol. Collected ticks were counted and identified in the laboratory using the identification key as described by Walker. RESULTS: Overall, seven species of ticks (Amblyomma variegatum, Boophilus decoloratus, Rm, Boophilus spp., Hyalomma spp., Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus spp.) were identified on nine wild animal species sampled (Cane rat, wildcat, Hare, Doe, Cricetoma, Buffalo, Buffon Cobe, and Bushbuck and Warthog). The average number of ticks varies from 3 to 6 between animal species, 3 to 7 between localities visited, and 2 to 5 between tick species. However, these differences are statistically significant only for localities. Considering tick species and animal species, the parasite load of Rm and Rhipicephalus spp. is higher; the buffalo being more infested. The analysis of deviance reveals that the abundance of ticks observed depends only on the observed localities (p\u003E0.05). However, the interactions between animal species and localities on the one hand and between animal and tick species on the other hand, although not significant, have influenced the abundance of ticks as they reduce the residual deviance after their inclusion in the model. CONCLUSIONS: This study reported the presence of Rm in wildlife of Benin and confirmed its role in the maintenance and spread of the parasites. It is, therefore, an important risk factor that we must not neglect in the epidemiological surveillance and ticks control strategies in the West African sub-region and particularly in Benin.","publish_time":"2018-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adinci, Kossi Justin; Akpo, Yao; Adoligbe, Camus; Adehan, Safiou Bienvenu; Yessinou, Roland Eric; Sod\u00E9, Akoeugnigan Idelphonse; Mensah, Guy Appolinaire; Youssao, Abdou Karim Issaka; Sinsin, Brice; Farougou, Soua\u00EFbou","journal":"Vet World","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a04811d55a6f779546cf0c2bf5d46982fb989908.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6048076.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2018.845-851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30034180/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Walker"],"organizations":["National Parks of Benin (Pendjari and W Park"],"locations":["Benin"],"keyphrases":["species of ticks","wild animal species","abundance of ticks","wildlife of Benin","problematic livestock tick species","ticks control strategies","presence of Rm","average number of ticks","observed localities","Rhipicephalus microplus","Rhipicephalus sanguineus","parasite load of Rm","National Parks of Benin","Buffalo","hand","study","AIM","possible role of reservoir wildlife","efficient control strategy","Boophilus decoloratus","West African sub-region","residual deviance","rapid propagation","analysis of deviance","Cane rat","Cricetoma","Doe","Hare","Pendjari","wildcat","Amblyomma variegatum","Buffon Cobe","wildfowl\u2019s assembly","W Park","Hyalomma","resistance","acaricides","Bushbuck","epidemiological surveillance","world","identification key","Warthog","inclusion","point","BACKGROUND","interactions","important risk factor","laboratory","Walker","MATERIALS","METHODS","maintenance","model","CONCLUSIONS","work","hunters","differences","forceps","parasites","ethanol","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

The aim is to describe the genetic diversity and clinical outcomes of FLUV detected at a tertiary university hospital in Barcelona (Spain) during the 2012\u20132016 seasons. Methods The detection of FLUV from patients attended at the Emergency Department or admitted to the hospital was performed by either immunofluorescence or PCR-based assays. A specific real-time one-step multiplex RT-PCR was performed for influenza A (FLUAV) subtyping. The complete coding haemagglutinin domain 1 (HA1) and neuraminidase (NA) (2015\u20132016) protein sequences from a representative sampling were molecular characterised. Results A total 1774 (66.1%) FLUAV and 910 (33.9%) influenza B (FLUBV) cases were laboratory-confirmed. The hospitalisation rate was different between seasons, being the highest (81.4%) during the 2014\u20132015 season. FLUV were genetically close to vaccine strains except to the 2014\u20132015, in which most characterised A(H3N2) viruses belonged to a genetic group different from the vaccine strain. During the 2015\u20132016 season, B/Victoria-like viruses were the most predominant, but this component was not included in the trivalent vaccine used. Mutations D222G or D222N in HA1-domain were found in 3 A(H1N1)pdm09 strains from ICU-admitted cases. Three A(H1N1)pdm09 strains carried the NA H275Y (2) and S247N (1) mutations, respectively related to resistance or decreased susceptibility to oseltamivir. Conclusions The circulation of drifted A(H3N2) strains during the 2014\u20132015 season was related to the high hospitalisation rate due to the mismatch with the vaccine strains. The predominance of a FLUBV lineage not included in the trivalent influenza vaccine during the 2015\u20132016 season highlights the need to use a tetravalent influenza vaccine. Virological surveillance of viral variants carrying protein changes that alter tropism and susceptibility to antivirals features should be strengthened in hospital settings.","publish_time":"2019-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andr\u00E9s, Cristina; Peremiquel-Trillas, Paula; Gimferrer, Laura; Pi\u00F1ana, Maria; Codina, Maria Gema; Rodrigo-Pend\u00E1s, Jos\u00E9 \u00C1ngel; Campins-Mart\u00ED, Magda; Carmen Mart\u00EDn, Mar\u00EDa; Fuentes, Francisco; Rubio, Susana; Pumarola, Tom\u00E0s; Ant\u00F3n, Andr\u00E9s","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb16156742a4d28f23dfd6d1810c8e36b69e04f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173002.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30926297/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.03.046; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X19303809; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19303809","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs5NzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FLUV","NA"],"locations":["Barcelona"],"keyphrases":["vaccine strains","trivalent influenza vaccine","tetravalent influenza vaccine","trivalent vaccine","influenza B","pdm09 strains","vaccine strain composition","Abstract Background Influenza viruses","detection of FLUV","occurrence of seasonal influenza epidemics","need","HA1-domain","clinical outcomes of FLUV","cases","hospital settings","H3N2","H1N1","seasons","FLUAV","genetic group different","tertiary university hospital","high hospitalisation rate","protein changes","genetic diversity","protein sequences","decreased susceptibility","NA H275Y","FLUBV lineage","Mutations D222G","PCR-based assays","complete coding haemagglutinin domain","specific real-time one-step multiplex RT-PCR","tropism","Virological surveillance of viral variants","patients","representative sampling","mismatch","antivirals features","Barcelona","Spain","resistance","immunofluorescence","D222N","ICU","circulation of drifted","Emergency Department","oseltamivir","Methods","S247N","laboratory","neuraminidase","Victoria","Conclusions","component","predominance","aim","subtyping"],"language":"en"},

Fifteen expeditions led by 12 nations amassed a large amount of data, but the scientific value was diminished by disjointed publication efforts and lack of long-term institutional commitment; lessons were learned and corrected in subsequent polar years. The second IPY began in 1932. Forty-four nations led expeditions in the Arctic and Antarctic, resulting in greater understanding of the aurora, magnetism, and meteorology. Air and marine navigation, radio operations, and weather forecasting were greatly improved as a result. The third IPY, in 1957-58, was renamed the International Geophysical Year and capitalized on technologic advances developed during World War II.

Conclusion Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor users had a lower risk of ESRD and mortality than did nonusers among patients with diabetes after weaning from dialysis-requiring AKI. Therefore, a prospective study of AKI to CKD transitions after episodes of AKI is needed to optimally target DPP4i interventions.","publish_time":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Cheng-Yi; Wu, Vin-Cent; Lin, Cheng-Jui; Lin, Chih-Sheng; Pan, Chi-Feng; Chen, Han-Hsiang; Lin, Yu-Feng; Huang, Tao-Min; Chen, Likwang; Wu, Chih-Jen; Lai, Tai-Shuan; Tsai, I-Jung; Lai, Chun-Fu; Chu, Tzong-Shinn; Chen, Yung-Ming; Wang, Jian-Jhong; Chang, Yu-Hsing; Shiao, Chih-Chung; Wang, Wei-Jie; Lin, Jui-Hsiang; Wu, Che-Hsiung; Yeh, Yu-Chang; Lai, Chien-Heng; Tseng, Li-Jung; Wu, Kwan-Dun","journal":"Mayo Clinic Proceedings","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a4af315986354d77cdebc2cad88d482d8d2d59d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126857.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30343892/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619618305330; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619618305330; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2018.06.023","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["AKI","Dipeptidyl"],"organizations":["National Health Insurance Research Database","ESRD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Patients","DPP4i users","DPP4i nonusers","episodes of AKI","diabetes","dialysis","DPP4i interventions","lower risk of ESRD","prospective study of AKI","inhibitor users","CKD transitions","advanced CKD","chronic kidney disease","risk of major adverse cardiovascular events","angiotensin","hospitalized heart failure","hazard ratio","attenuating progression of diabetic kidney disease","pleiotropic effects of dipeptidyl peptidase","acute kidney injury","all-cause mortality","Conclusion Dipeptidyl peptidase","enzyme inhibitor","probability of treatment","incident end-stage renal disease","potential beneficial effects","treatment selection bias","inverse-weighted estimates","long-term effect","DPP4is","inhibitors","National Health Insurance Research Database","Methods Data","Cox proportional hazards models","receptor blocker use","outcomes","adjustments","contrast","total","Abstract Objective","Results","groups"],"language":"en"},

However, the passage of staff through isolation room doors is suspected to be a cause of containment failure, especially in case of hinged doors. It is therefore important to minimize inadvertent contaminant airflow leakage across the doorway during such movements. To this end, it is essential to investigate the behavior of such airflows, especially the overall volume of air that can potentially leak across the doorway during door-opening and human passage. Experimental measurements using full-scale mock-ups are expensive and labour intensive. A useful alternative approach is the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling using a time-resolved Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method. In this study simulated air flow patterns are qualitatively compared with experimental ones, and the simulated total volume of air that escapes is compared with the experimentally measured volume. It is shown that the LES method is able to reproduce, at room scale, the complex transient airflows generated during door-opening/closing motions and the passage of a human figure through the doorway between two rooms. This was a basic test case that was performed in an isothermal environment without ventilation. However, the advantage of the CFD approach is that the addition of ventilation airflows and a temperature difference between the rooms is, in principle, a relatively simple task. A standard method to observe flow structures is dosing smoke into the flow. In this paper we introduce graphical methods to simulate smoke experiments by LES, making it very easy to compare the CFD simulation to the experiments. The results demonstrate that the transient CFD simulation is a promising tool to compare different isolation room scenarios without the need to construct full-scale experimental models. The CFD model is able to reproduce the complex airflows and estimate the volume of air escaping as a function of time. In this test, the calculated migrated air volume in the CFD model differed by 20% from the experimental tracer gas measurements. In the case containing only a hinged door operation, without passage, the difference was only 10%.","publish_time":"2015-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saarinen, Pekka E.; Kalliom\u00E4ki, Petri; Tang, Julian W.; Koskela, Hannu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a5d44eaf14b7ed5402af3501540147d36b314824.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4494857.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26151865/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130667","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Computational Fluid Dynamics","CFD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CFD approach","CFD model","transient CFD simulation","volume of air escaping","overall volume of air","simulated total volume of air","calculated migrated air volume","complex airflows","air flow patterns","Experimental measurements","measured volume","doorway","human passage","isolation room doors","complex transient airflows","experimental ones","passage of staff","full-scale experimental models","addition of ventilation airflows","case of hinged doors","different isolation room scenarios","room scale","use of hospital isolation rooms","hinged door operation","flow structures","experimental tracer gas measurements","basic test case","smoke experiments","standard method","Large Eddy Simulation","full-scale mock-ups","function of time","temperature difference","human figure","useful alternative approach","promising tool","need","application of Computational Fluid Dynamics","modelling","worldwide outbreaks of various emerging infectious diseases","inadvertent contaminant airflow leakage","escapes","recent years","labour intensive","graphical methods","cause of containment failure","principle","study","motions","results","isothermal environment","simple task","paper","movements","behavior","advantage","end"],"language":"en"},

The assay was carried out using two sets of primers designed to amplify highly conserved sequences of the nucleocapsid gene of BCoV and the internal control, bovine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, RNA. Specific identification of both targets was elucidated by melt curve analysis, in which the BCoV amplified product generated a melt peak at 78.35 \u00B1 0.26 \u00B0C and the internal control RNA at 82.54 \u00B1 0.32 \u00B0C. The assay was highly specific since all negative controls and other viruses of clinical and structural relevance failed to develop any positive results. The detection limit of the reaction was 10(3) plasmid copies and 1.17 \u00D7 10(\u22123) TCID(50) of the tissue culture propagated virus. Standard deviation and coefficient of variation was low for both intra-assay and inter-assay variability. The assay performance on field samples was evaluated on 103 (68 fecal and 35 nasal) swab specimens and compared with the conventional RT-PCR assay. The results of both assays matched for the diagnosis of 65 fecal and 33 nasal samples. However, three fecal and two nasal samples tested negative in gel-based assay were positive for the real-time RT-PCR. The robustness and a high-throughput performance of the developed assay make it a powerful tool in diagnostic applications and in BCoV research.","publish_time":"2011-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Amer, Haitham M.; Almajhdi, Fahad N.","journal":"Mol Cell Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/75441498b30257e8d2ce87c2eb4daf445fd11a4f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127634.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850811000144; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2011.03.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850811000144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21419844/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SYBR Green","ABI","TCID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["assay performance","developed assay","intra-assay","real-time RT-PCR assay","conventional RT-PCR assay","gel-based assay","inter-assay variability","nasal samples","quantification of BCoV","BCoV research","nucleocapsid gene of BCoV","BCoV amplified product","internal control RNA","detection limit","field samples","positive results","sequence detection system","negative controls","melt peak","Specific identification","high-throughput performance","ABI PRISM","bovine glyceraldehyde","SYBR Green","powerful tool","viruses of clinical","coefficient of variation","diagnostic applications","conserved sequences","structural relevance","swab specimens","targets","phosphate dehydrogenase","Standard deviation","novel two-step","curve analysis","robustness","reaction","diagnosis","tissue culture","sets of primers","assays","plasmid copies","TCID"],"language":"en"},

In addition, a series of AraU monophosphate prodrugs in the form of triester phosphoramidates (ProTides) were also synthesized and tested against a range of viruses, leukaemia and solid tumour cell lines. Unfortunately, neither the parent compound (AraU) nor any of its ProTides showed antiviral activity, nor potent inhibitory activity against any of the cancer cell lines. Therefore, the metabolism of AraU phosphoramidates to release AraU monophosphate was investigated. The results showed carboxypeptidase Y, hog liver esterase and crude CEM tumor cell extracts to hydrolyse the ester motif of phosphoramidates with subsequent loss of the aryl group, while molecular modelling studies suggested that the AraU l-alanine aminoacyl phosphate derivative might not be a good substrate for the phosphoramidase enzyme Hint-1. These findings are in agreement with the observed disappearance of intact prodrug and concomitant appearance of the corresponding phosphoramidate intermediate derivative in CEM cell extracts without measurable formation of araU monophosphate. These findings may explain the poor antiviral/cytostatic potential of the prodrugs.","publish_time":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mehellou, Youcef; Valente, Rocco; Mottram, Huw; Walsby, Elisabeth; Mills, Kenneth I.; Balzarini, Jan; McGuigan, Christopher","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61da96e057e06590c56c3fb5603b968adbcff909.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125968.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2010.02.059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20299228/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089610001902; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089610001902","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["metabolism of AraU phosphoramidates","series of AraU monophosphate prodrugs","measurable formation of araU monophosphate","antiviral activity","CEM cell extracts","cancer cell lines","crude CEM tumor cell extracts","solid tumour cell lines","poor antiviral","ProTides","findings","ester motif of phosphoramidates","form of triester phosphoramidates","potent inhibitory activity","corresponding phosphoramidate intermediate derivative","alanine aminoacyl phosphate derivative","hog liver esterase","concomitant appearance","aryl group","observed disappearance of intact prodrug","subsequent loss","leukaemia","carboxypeptidase Y","good substrate","uridine analogue","molecular modelling studies","phosphoramidase enzyme Hint","anticancer agent AraC","results","range of viruses","agreement","\u03B2-d","Arabinouridine","cytostatic potential","addition","parent compound","cytotoxicity"],"language":"en"},

Among these contaminants, deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin, is the most prevalent type B trichothecene mycotoxin worldwide. Pigs are very sensitive to the toxic effects of DON and are frequently exposed to naturally contaminated feed. Recently, DON naturally contaminated feed has been shown to decrease porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) specific antibody responses following experimental infection. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of DON naturally contaminated feed on the immune response generated following vaccination with PRRSV live attenuated vaccine. Eighteen pigs were randomly divided into three experimental groups of 6 animals based on DON content of the diets (0, 2.5 and 3.5mg DON/kg). They were fed these rations one week prior to the vaccination and for all the duration of the immune response evaluation. All pigs were vaccinated intra-muscularly with one dose of Ingelvac\u00AE PRRSV modified live vaccine (MLV). Blood samples were collected at day \u22121, 6, 13, 20, 27 and 35 post vaccination (pv) and tested for PRRSV RNA by RT-qPCR and for virus specific antibodies by ELISA. Results showed that ingestion of DON-contaminated diets significantly decreased PRRSV viremia. All pigs fed control diet were viremic while only 1 (17%) and 3 (50%) out of 6 pigs were viremic in the groups receiving 3.5 and 2.5mg of DON/kg, respectively. Subsequently, all pigs fed control diet developed PRRSV specific antibodies while only viremic pigs that were fed contaminated diets have developed PRRSV specific antibodies. These results suggest that feeding pigs with DON-contaminated diet could inhibit vaccination efficiency of PRRSV MLV by severely impairing viral replication.","publish_time":"2015-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savard, Christian; Gagnon, Carl A.; Chorfi, Younes","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/afe94c3bb91a1c03adb2ddb381ff0d754c903b50.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127064.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15008701; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X15008701; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.06.069; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26117152/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DON-contaminated diet","viremic pigs","PRRSV specific antibodies","contaminated diets","contaminated feed","impact of DON","ingestion of DON","DON content","PRRSV RNA","PRRSV viremia","vaccination efficiency of PRRSV MLV","toxic effects of DON","virus specific antibodies","following vaccination","control diet","post vaccination","specific antibody responses","experimental infection","live vaccine","experimental groups","Results","immune response evaluation","attenuated vaccine","respiratory syndrome virus","secondary metabolism of fungal infection","RT-qPCR","prevalent type B trichothecene mycotoxin","dose of Ingelvac","impairing viral replication","mycotoxins","duration","pv","animals","vomitoxin","ELISA","Abstract Cereal commodities","Blood samples","day","study","rations","week","contaminants","deoxynivalenol","objective"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We reviewed research articles published within the last decade that used digital data to answer epidemiological research questions. Data were abstracted from these articles using a data collection tool that we developed. Finally, we summarized the characteristics of the digital epidemiological studies. RESULTS: We identified six main topic domains: infectious diseases (58.7%), non-communicable diseases (29.4%), mental health and substance use (8.3%), general population behavior (4.6%), environmental, dietary, and lifestyle (4.6%), and vital status (0.9%). We identified four categories for the study purpose: description (22.9%), exploration (34.9%), explanation (27.5%), and prediction and control (14.7%). We identified eight categories for the data sources: web search query (52.3%), social media posts (31.2%), web portal posts (11.9%), webpage access logs (7.3%), images (7.3%), mobile phone network data (1.8%), global positioning system data (1.8%), and others (2.8%).

CONCLUSIONS: Digital data collected for non-epidemiological purposes are being used to study health phenomena in a variety of topic domains. Digital epidemiology requires access to large datasets and advanced analytics. Ensuring open access is clearly at odds with the desire to have as little personal data as possible in these large datasets to protect privacy. Establishment of data cooperatives with restricted access may be a solution to this dilemma.","publish_time":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Hyeoun-Ae; Jung, Hyesil; On, Jeongah; Park, Seul Ki; Kang, Hannah","journal":"Healthc Inform Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c84aa58b12823cdd6f119b4da3b0c4ba488856b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6230537.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4258/hir.2018.24.4.253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30443413/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Digital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["digital data","data sources","little personal data","Establishment of data cooperatives","data collection tool","digital epidemiological studies","mobile phone network data","global positioning system data","Digital epidemiology","restricted access","study purpose","open access","non-epidemiological purposes","epidemiological research questions","large datasets","main topic domains","variety of topic domains","regression analyses","webpage access logs","research articles","descriptive analyses","correlation analyses","categories","non-communicable diseases","web portal posts","infectious diseases","mental health","health phenomena","web search query","social media posts","researchers","machine learning","desire","description","advanced analytics","decade","substance use","analytic method","solution","odds","OBJECTIVES","characteristics","CONCLUSIONS","general population behavior","lifestyle","exploration","images","RESULTS","METHODS","privacy","vital status","prediction","control","explanation","dilemma"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (R t) at the provincial level. Findings We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33\u201356), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged \u003E64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4\u00B74 days (95% CI 0\u00B70\u201314\u00B70) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2\u00B76 days (0\u00B70\u20139\u00B70) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5\u00B72 days (1\u00B78\u201312\u00B74) and the mean serial interval at 5\u00B71 days (1\u00B73\u201311\u00B76). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission. We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1\u00B708 (95% CI 0\u00B774\u20131\u00B754) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1\u00B771 (1\u00B732\u20132\u00B717) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, \u003C1) after Jan 30. Interpretation Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community. Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.

Non-immune antibody phage display libraries are an efficient in vitro method for selecting monoclonal antibodies and hence ideal in these circumstances. Such libraries can be constructed from a variety of sources e.g. B cell cDNA or synthetically generated, and use a variety of antibody formats, typically scFv or Fab. However, antibody source and format can impact on the quality of antibodies generated and hence the effectiveness of this methodology for the timely production of antibodies. We have carried out a comparative screening of two antibody libraries, a semi-synthetic scFv library and a human-derived Fab library against the protective antigen toxin component of Bacillus anthracis and the epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum. We have shown that while the synthetic library produced a diverse collection of specific scFv-phage, these contained a high frequency of unnatural amber stops and glycosylation sites which limited their conversion to IgG, and also a high number which lost specificity when expressed as IgG. In contrast, these limitations were overcome by the use of a natural human library. Antibodies from both libraries could be used to develop sandwich ELISA assays with similar sensitivity. However, the ease and speed with which full-length IgG could be generated from the human-derived Fab library makes screening this type of library the preferable method for rapid antibody generation for diagnostic assay development.","publish_time":"2011-10-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Conrad E.Z.; Chan, Annie H.Y.; Lim, Angeline P.C.; Hanson, Brendon J.","journal":"Journal of Immunological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbef2a6b40647fe55f4c6d2e082d1624eeb63741.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094349.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175911002109; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175911002109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21856306/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2011.08.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antibody libraries","synthetic library","type of library","human-derived Fab library","natural human library","semi-synthetic scFv library","antibody source","monoclonal antibodies","quality of antibodies","rapid antibody generation","variety of antibody formats","timely production of antibodies","timely isolation of specific antibodies","Non-immune antibody phage display libraries","full-length IgG","use","diverse collection of specific scFv-phage","diagnostic assay development","Abstract Rapid development of diagnostic immunoassays","preferable method","variety of sources","high number","comparative screening","epsilon toxin of Clostridium botulinum","high frequency of unnatural amber stops","protective antigen toxin component of Bacillus anthracis","novel emerging","modified pathogens","glycosylation sites","emergency situation","sandwich ELISA assays","similar sensitivity","B cell cDNA","methodology","ease","speed","conversion","specificity","effectiveness","limitations","circumstances","contrast"],"language":"en"},

A 33.5-kb nidovirus has been considered close to the upper size limit for such entities; conversely, the minimal cellular DNA genome is ~200 kb. This large difference presents a daunting gap for the transition from primordial RNP to contemporary DNA-RNP-based life. Whether or not RNA viruses represent transitional steps on the road to DNA-based life, studies of larger RNA viruses advance our understanding of size constraints on RNP entities. For example, emergence of the largest previously known RNA genomes (20-34 kb in positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) is associated with a proofreading exoribonuclease encoded in the nidoviral open reading frame 1b (ORF1b). However, apparent constraints on the size of ORF1b, which encodes this and other key replicative enzymes, have been hypothesized to limit further expansion of viral RNA genomes. Here, we characterize a novel nidovirus (planarian secretory cell nidovirus; PSCNV) whose disproportionately large ORF1b-like region, and overall 41.1 kb genome, substantially extend the presumed limits on RNA genome size. This genome encodes a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein in an unconventional single ORF, yet retains canonical nidoviral genome organization and expression, and key replicative domains. Our evolutionary analysis suggests that PSCNV diverged early from multi-ORF nidoviruses, and subsequently acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA viruses or hosts. PSCNV\u2019s greatly expanded genome, proteomic complexity, and unique features \u2013 impressive in themselves \u2013 attest to the likelihood of still-larger RNA genomes awaiting discovery. RNA viruses are the only known RNA-protein (RNP) entities capable of autonomous replication.

This large difference presents a daunting gap for the proposed evolution of contemporary DNA-RNP-based life from primordial RNP entities. Here, we describe a nidovirus from planarians, whose 41.1 kb genome is 23% larger than the largest known of RNA virus. The planarian secretory cell nidovirus has broken apparent constraints on the size of the genomic subregion that encodes core replication machinery, and has acquired genes not previously observed in RNA viruses.

Understanding the economic impacts of this novel disease is important for making decisions on health resource allocation, including infectious disease prevention and control investment. However, there are limited data on such impacts. METHODS: Hospitalized laboratory-confirmed H7N9 patients or their families in Jiangsu Province of China were interviewed. Patients\u2019 direct medical costs of hospitalization were derived from their hospital bills. A generalized linear model was employed to estimate the mean direct medical costs of patients with different characteristics. RESULTS: The mean direct cost of hospitalization for H7N9 was estimated to be \u00A5 71 060 (95 % CI, 48 180\u2013104 820), i.e., US$ 10 996 (95 % CI, 7 455\u201316 220), and was \u00A512 060 (US$ 1 861), \u00A5136 120 (US$ 21 001) and \u00A5218 610 (US$ 33 728) for those who had mild or severe symptoms or who died, respectively. The principal components of the total fees differed among patients with different disease severity, although medication fees were always the largest contributors. Disease severity, proportion of reimbursement and family member monthly average income were identified as the key factors that contributed to a patient\u2019s direct medical cost of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The direct medical costs of hospitalized patients with H7N9 are significant, and far surpass the annual per capita income of Jiangsu Province, China. The influencing factors identified should be taken into account when developing related health insurance policies and making health resource allocation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.

This study tested the hypothesis that bacterial co-infection during ARI adds to airway inflammation and illness severity. METHODS: Two groups of 97 specimens each were randomly selected from multiplex-PCR identified virus-positive and virus-negative nasal specimens obtained from adults with new onset ARI, and 40 control specimens were collected from healthy adults. All specimens were analyzed for Haemophilus influenza(HI), Moraxella catarrhalis(MC) and Streptococcus pneumonia(SP) by quantitative-PCR. General linear models tested for relationships between respiratory pathogens, biomarkers (nasal wash neutrophils and CXCL8), and ARI-severity. RESULTS: Nasal specimens from adults with ARIs were more likely to contain bacteria (37% overall; HI=28%, MC=14%, SP=7%) compared to specimens from healthy adults (5% overall; HI=0%, MC=2.5%, SP=2.5%;p\u003C0.001). Among ARI specimens, bacteria were more likely to be detected among virus-negative specimens compared to virus-positive specimens (46% vs. 27%;p=0.0046). The presence of bacteria was significantly associated with increased CXCL8 and neutrophils, but not increased symptoms. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic bacteria were more often detected in virus-negative ARI, and also associated with increased inflammatory biomarkers. These findings suggest the possibility that bacteria may augment virus-induced ARI and contribute to airway inflammation. SUMMARY: We tested whether bacterial pathogens were associated with ARI illness and inflammation. Bacteria were detected more often in nasal secretions during ARI, especially in samples without detectable viruses, and were associated with increased airway inflammation, but not increased symptoms.","publish_time":"2014-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Obasi, Chidi N.; Barrett, Bruce; Brown, Roger; Vrtis, Rose; Barlow, Shari; Muller, Daniel; Gern, James","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29efc0bd65a4b62262d54f5ba2245a7ad4cfcf7f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/eb23603ee60351141aaa77594103d378e5648141.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3947238.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3947238?pdf=render; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445313003307; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445313003307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24211414/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2013.10.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARI","Moraxella","Streptococcus"],"organizations":["SP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARI specimens","virus-negative ARI","virus-negative specimens","virus-positive specimens","ARI illness","virus-negative nasal specimens","ARI-severity","virus-induced ARI","control specimens","role of bacteria","increased airway inflammation","Pathogenic bacteria","presence of bacteria","new onset ARI","healthy adults","increased CXCL8","increased symptoms","MC","increased inflammatory biomarkers","nasal secretions","nasal wash neutrophils","respiratory pathogens","bacterial pathogens","illness severity","quantitative-PCR","multiplex-PCR","acute respiratory illnesses","bacterial co-infection","relationships","Moraxella catarrhalis","Streptococcus pneumonia","hypothesis","ARIs","Haemophilus influenza","General linear models","samples","interactions","study","viral infections","detectable viruses","possibility","RESULTS","SUMMARY","CONCLUSION","findings","OBJECTIVES","METHODS","groups"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated the anti-T. gondii effects of ursolic acid, and analyzed the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytokines through co-cultured immune cells, as well as the expression of intracellular organelles of T. gondii. The subcellular organelles and granules of T. gondii, particularly rhoptry protein 18, microneme protein 8, and inner membrane complex sub-compartment protein 3, were markedly decreased when T. gondii was treated with ursolic acid, and their expressions were effectively inhibited. Furthermore, ursolic acid effectively increased the production of NO, ROS, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon-\u03B2, while reducing the expression of IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03B1), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03B21) in T. gondii-infected immune cells. These results demonstrate that ursolic acid not only causes anti-T. gondii activity/action by effectively inhibiting the survival of T. gondii and the subcellular organelles of T. gondii, but also induces specific immunomodulatory effects in T. gondii-infected immune cells. Therefore, this study indicates that ursolic acid can be effectively utilized as a potential candidate agent for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis drugs, and has immunomodulatory activity.","publish_time":"2019-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Won Hyung; Lee, In Ah","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5b87074a3f33c0a1408a01218e1776ae85f5b31.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6631288.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens8020061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjszOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gondii effects of ursolic acid","gondii activity","gondii-infected immune cells","terms of anti-Toxoplasma gondii effects","expression of IL","specific immunomodulatory effects","immunomodulatory activity","subcellular organelles","microneme protein","rhoptry protein","co-cultured immune cells","expression of intracellular organelles","study","novel anti-toxoplasmosis drugs","growth factor beta","tumor necrosis factor alpha","mechanism of action","interferon-\u03B2","inner membrane complex sub-compartment protein","production of nitric oxide","cytokines","GM-CSF","TNF-\u03B1","granulocyte macrophage colony","potential candidate agent","TGF-\u03B21","reactive oxygen species","granules","interleukin","survival","results","expressions"],"language":"en"},

In March, it introduced further measures to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), placing the country in a state of almost complete lockdown. We report the impact of these restrictions on glucose control among people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: Data were collected on 33 individuals with T1D who were monitoring their glucose levels using a flash glucose monitoring device and remotely connected to the diabetes clinic on a cloud platform. We retrieved information on average glucose, standard deviation and percentage time in hypoglycaemia (\u003C 70 mg/dl), glucose range (70\u2013180 mg/dl) and hyperglycaemia (\u003E 180 mg/dl). We compared glycaemic measures collected during lockdown to those collected before the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and to the periods immediately before lockdown. RESULTS: In 20 patients who had stopped working and were at home as a result of the lockdown, overall glycaemic control improved during the first 7 days of the lockdown as compared to the weeks before the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Average glucose declined from 177 \u00B1 45 mg/dl (week before lockdown) to 160 \u00B1 40 mg/dl (lockdown; p = 0.005) and the standard deviation improved significantly. Time in range increased from 54.4 to 65.2% (p = 0.010), and time in hyperglycaemia decreased from 42.3 to 31.6% (p = 0.016). The number of scans per day remained unchanged. In 13 patients who continued working, none of the measures of glycaemic control changed during lockdown. CONCLUSION: Despite the limited possibility to exercise and the incumbent psychologic stress, glycaemic control improved in patients with T1D who stopped working during the lockdown, suggesting that slowing down routine daily activities can have beneficial effects on T1D management, at least in the short term.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonora, Benedetta Maria; Boscari, Federico; Avogaro, Angelo; Bruttomesso, Daniela; Fadini, Gian Paolo","journal":"Diabetes Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/719190632abf1249a1976c0196fb89e516aadb8b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7213551.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32395187/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13300-020-00829-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYyLmNzdjs0MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1734912,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Nm0fC3NSXICXHRkHIkgHmQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_62.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glucose control","complete lockdown","average glucose","glucose range","measures of glycaemic control","glucose levels","glycaemic measures","spread of SARS","SARS-CoV","patients","T1D management","flash glucose monitoring device","spread of coronavirus disease","standard deviation","percentage time","hyperglycaemia","spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","diabetes clinic","sport activities","routine daily activities","beneficial effects","people","incumbent psychologic stress","type","hypoglycaemia","restrictions","information","limited possibility","number of scans","Italian Government","cloud platform","COVID","state","epidemic","impact","weeks","short term","Data","CONCLUSION","country","individuals","periods","home","days","INTRODUCTION","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Aptamers as potential alternatives for antibodies could be directed against any protein in infected cells and any components of viral particles. In this review, we will focus on recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of viral hepatitis based on aptamer technology. In recent years, various types of aptamers including RNA and DNA were introduced against viral hepatitis. Some of these aptamers can be utilized for early and precise diagnosis of hepatitis infections and other group selected as therapeutic tools against viral targets. Designing diagnostic and therapeutic platforms based on aptamer technology is a promising approach in viral infections. The obtained aptamers in the recent years showed obvious potential for use as diagnostic and therapeutic tools against viral hepatitis.

Anti\u2013\u03B2-lactam blood allergy tests were also obtained. All subjects underwent an oral challenge test (OCT) with the culprit antibiotic. Results Eighty-eight children were enrolled between 2006 and 2008. There were 11 (12.5%) positive intradermal and no positive patch tests. There were 2 (2.3%) positive blood allergy tests. There were 6 (6.8%) subjects with a positive OCT, 2 were intradermal-negative, and 4 were intradermal-positive. No OCT reactions were more severe than the index event. Most subjects had at least 1 positive viral study, 54 (65.9%) in the OCT negative group. Conclusion In this situation, \u03B2-lactam allergy is clearly overdiagnosed because the skin rash is only rarely reproducible (6.8%) by a subsequent challenge. Viral infections may be an important factor in many of these rashes. OCTs were positive in a minority of intradermal skin test\u2013positive subjects. Patch testing and blood allergy testing provided no useful information. OCTs should be considered in all children who develop a delayed-onset urticarial or maculopapular rash during treatment with a \u03B2-lactam.","publish_time":"2011-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Caubet, Jean-Christoph; Kaiser, Laurent; Lema\u00EEtre, Barbara; Fellay, Beno\u00EEt; Gervaix, Alain; Eigenmann, Philippe A.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7f5bc330a002fd3a2254a46d18aa617f15c38dd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126001.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2010.08.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21035175/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009167491001273X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009167491001273X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intradermal-positive","positive subjects","positive patch tests","positive blood allergy tests","\u03B2-lactam allergy","positive viral study","blood allergy testing","\u03B2-lactam blood allergy tests","Patch testing","\u03B2-lactams","maculopapular rashes","intradermal-negative","patch skin testing","delayed-onset urticarial","minority of intradermal skin test","skin rash","reliable testing","Methods Children","viral screening","Viral infections","OCTs","oral challenge test","allergic causes","subsequent challenge","negative group","emergency department","treatment","convalescent sera","important factor","months","useful information","situation","throat swab","presentation","Background","index event","reactions","Objective","etiology","Conclusion","culprit antibiotic","Results"],"language":"en"},

Current serological assays such as microneutralization (MN), plaque reduction neutralization, immunofluorescence, protein microarray or pseudoparticle neutralization assays rely on handling of live MERS-CoV in high containment laboratories or need for expensive and special equipment and reagents and highly trained personnel which represent a technical hurdle for most laboratories in resource-limited MERS-CoV endemic countries. Here, we developed, compared and evaluated three different indirect ELISAs based on MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (N), spike (S) ectodomain (amino acids 1\u20131297) and S1 subunit (amino acids 1\u2013725) and compared them with MN assay. The developed ELISAs were evaluated using large number of confirmed seropositive (79 samples) and seronegative (274 samples) MERS-CoV human serum samples. Both rS1- and rS-ELISAs maintained high sensitivity and specificity (\u226590%) across a wider range of OD values compared to rN-ELISA. Moreover, rS1- and rS-based ELISAs showed better agreement and correlation with MN assay in contrast to rN-ELISA.

Recently, a rodent mammarenavirus, W\u0113nzh\u014Du virus (WENV) and related viruses, have been reported in China, Cambodia, and Thailand. Moreover, in Cambodia, these viruses were suspected to be associated with human disease. In China, Yunnan Province is famous for its abundant animal and plant diversity and is adjacent to several South-eastern Asia countries. Therefore, it is necessary to know whether WENV-related viruses, or other mammarenaviruses, are prevalent in this province. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Small mammals were trapped, euthanized, and sampled. Mammarenavirus RNA was detected using a nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 1040 small mammals belonging to 13 genera and 26 species were trapped in Yunnan Province. WENV-related mammarenaviruses were detected in 41 rodent liver samples, mainly in brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and oriental house rats (R. tanezumi).Viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in liver sections by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Full-length-genomes were amplified by RT-PCR and used for phylogenetic analysis with the MEGA package. Recombination analysis was performed using the SimPlot and Recombination Detection Program. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: WENV related viruses circulated in small mammals in Yunnan Province. Whole genome sequence analysis of five selected viral strains showed that these viruses are closely related to WENVs discovered in Asia and form an independent branch in the phylogenetic tree in the WENV clade. Paying attention to investigate the influence of these viruses to public health is essential in the epidemic regions.","publish_time":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jinxia; Yang, Xinglou; Liu, Haizhou; Wang, Li; Zhou, Jihua; Han, Xi; Zhu, Yan; Yang, Weihong; Pan, Hong; Zhang, Yunzhi; Shi, Zhengli","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/295d0e530c6b6d9df5c46872c36bf15dc85507fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6395006.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30768614/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WENV"],"locations":["Africa","America","Thailand","Cambodia","China","South-eastern Asia","Asia"],"keyphrases":["WENV-related viruses","WENV related viruses","WENV-related mammarenaviruses","Yunnan Province","Small mammals","WENV clade","phylogenetic analysis","Recombination analysis","real-time RT-PCR","rodent mammarenavirus","China","Cambodia","rodent liver samples","genome sequence analysis","brown rats","liver sections","phylogenetic tree","Mammarenavirus RNA","human disease","oriental house rats","selected viral strains","Viral nucleocapsid protein","South-eastern Asia countries","Recombination Detection Program","human hemorrhagic fever diseases","nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","tanezumi","Rattus norvegicus","abundant animal","public health","W\u0113nzh\u014Du virus","plant diversity","Africa","SimPlot","America","indirect immunofluorescence assay","independent branch","influence","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE","epidemic regions","MEGA package","genera","species","length-genomes","Thailand","BACKGROUND","total","WENVs","attention"],"language":"en"},

Such an understanding of the relatedness of newly discovered filoviruses may help to predict risk factors for outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in humans and/or non-human primates. Recent discoveries such as three distinct genotypes of Reston ebolavirus, unexpectedly discovered in domestic swine in the Philippines; as well as a new species, Bundibugyo ebolavirus; the recent discovery of Lloviu virus as a potential new genus, Cuevavirus, within Filoviridae; and germline integrations of filovirus-like sequences in some animal species bring new insights into the relatedness of filoviruses, their prevalence and potential for transmission to humans. These new findings reveal that filoviruses are more diverse and may have had a greater influence on the evolution of animals than previously thought. Herein we review these findings with regard to the implications for understanding the host range, prevalence and transmission of Filoviridae.","publish_time":"2011-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barrette, Roger W.; Xu, Lizhe; Rowland, Jessica M.; McIntosh, Michael T.","journal":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/613c002da74850a9055fceaabb8a20d27c2c69b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106080.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134811002309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21742058/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2011.06.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134811002309","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Philippines"],"keyphrases":["humans","new species","new findings","potential new genus","new insights","relatedness of filoviruses","discovered filoviruses","non-human primates","prevalence","potential reservoirs","transmission of Filoviridae","understanding","outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease","Marburg viruses","Bundibugyo ebolavirus","host range","animal species","host tropisms","Recent discoveries","Abstract Sporadic fatal outbreaks of disease","recent discovery of Lloviu virus","distinct genotypes of Reston ebolavirus","sequences","driven research","risk factors","characterization","hopes","Cuevavirus","germline integrations of filovirus","implications","greater influence","domestic swine","evolution of animals","Philippines","regard"],"language":"en"},

At present, more and more information is available on the functional relationship between RPs and virus infection. This review focuses on advancements in my own understanding of critical roles of RPs in the life cycle of viruses. Various RPs interact with viral mRNA and proteins to participate in viral protein biosynthesis and regulate the replication and infection of virus in host cells. Most interactions are essential for viral translation and replication, which promote viral infection and accumulation, whereas the minority represents the defense signaling of host cells by activating immune pathway against virus.

This presents a unique challenge because an intact blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and lack of proper lymphatic drainage keeps the CNS virtually outside the radar of circulating immune cells that are at constant vigilance for antigens in peripheral tissues. Limited antigen presentation skills of CNS cells in comparison to peripheral tissues is because of a total lack of dendritic cells and feeble expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins in neurons and glia. However, research over the past two decades has identified immune effector mechanisms intrinsic to the CNS for immediate tackling, attenuating and clearing of viral infections, with assistance pouring in from peripheral circulation in the form of neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T cells at a later stage. Specialized CNS cells, microglia and astrocytes, were regarded as sole sentinels of the brain for containing a viral onslaught but neurons held little recognition as a potential candidate for protecting itself from the proliferation and pathogenesis of neurotropic viruses. Accumulating evidence however indicates that extracellular insult causes neurons to express immune factors characteristic of lymphoid tissues. This article aims to comprehensively analyze current research on this conditional alteration in the protein expression repertoire of neurons and the role it plays in CNS innate immune response to counter viral infections.","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chakraborty, Swarupa; Nazmi, Arshed; Dutta, Kallol; Basu, Anirban","journal":"Neurochemistry International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18f35a5b2fe4ead8682f3f273d9c9ca60c8bd0ad.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115389.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20206655/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197018610000859; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197018610000859; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2010.02.016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","Specialized CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Specialized CNS cells","immune cells","peripheral tissues","Limited antigen presentation skills of CNS cells","counter viral infections","immune response","viral attack","viral onslaught","cytotoxic T cells","total lack of dendritic cells","protein expression repertoire of neurons","immune factors characteristic of lymphoid tissues","peripheral circulation","immune effector mechanisms intrinsic","brain barrier","current research","lack of proper lymphatic drainage","feeble expression of major histocompatibility complex","BBB","MHC","form of neutralizing antibodies","intact blood","proteins","conditional alteration","decades","little recognition","astrocytes","constant vigilance","comparison","extracellular insult","role","defensive antiviral responses","central nervous system","proliferation","potential candidate","minimal collateral damage","later stage","antigens","immediate tackling","assistance","non-regenerating neural tissue","microglia","unique challenge","pathogenesis of neurotropic viruses","Accumulating evidence","sole sentinels","radar","article"],"language":"en"},

Genetically diverse hepadnaviruses were identified in a broad range of bat species, with an overall prevalence of 13.3%. In contrast, no rodent hepadnaviruses were identified. The newly discovered bat hepadnaviruses fell into two distinct phylogenetic groups. The viruses within the first group exhibited high diversity, with some closely related to viruses previously identified in Yunnan province. Strikingly, the newly discovered viruses sampled from Jiyuan city in the second phylogenetic group were most closely related to those found in bats from West Africa, suggestive of a long-term association between bats and hepadnaviruses. A co-phylogenetic analysis revealed frequent cross-species transmission among bats from different species, genera, and families. Overall, these data suggest that there are likely few barriers to the cross-species transmission of bat hepadnaviruses.","publish_time":"2018-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nie, Fang-Yuan; Lin, Xian-Dan; Hao, Zong-Yu; Chen, Xiao-Nan; Wang, Zhao-Xiao; Wang, Miao-Ruo; Wu, Jun; Wang, Hong-Wei; Zhao, Guoqiang; Ma, Runlin Z.; Holmes, Edward C.; Zhang, Yong-Zhen","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e8a489db3c5d8c384aed02690b423502f648f18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172093.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217303768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29153861/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.11.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217303768","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Henan","China","Zhejiang","West Africa"],"keyphrases":["bats","discovered bat hepadnaviruses","cross-species transmission of bat hepadnaviruses","evolution of hepadnaviruses","rodent hepadnaviruses","diverse hepadnaviruses","different species","discovered viruses","frequent cross-species transmission","broad range of bat species","co-phylogenetic analysis","distinct phylogenetic groups","Zhejiang provinces","Yunnan province","overall prevalence","China","long-term association","rodents","Henan","Jiyuan city","Guizhou","West Africa","genera","barriers","families","high diversity","contrast","data"],"language":"en"},

Using Singapore as a case study, we explore how the state constructs the disease and implements measures targeted at creating a ring of defense around the island and using surveillance to monitor and prevent its spread. While there is support, there is also resentment among some Singaporeans who complain that their right to privacy has been invaded and that over surveillance may have actually occurred. Marginalisation and discrimination have not only affected the local population but in this open economy which is striving to achieve global city status, businesses, tourism, foreign talent, foreign contract workers and foreign students studying in Singapore have also been negatively affected. While Singapore has been applauded by WHO and used as an example of quick and effective response, a holistic approach to the management of infectious disease must address the social implications of strategies that are drawn from medical knowledge alone because it impinges on the social lives of people and how people interact with each other under stressful circumstances.","publish_time":"2005-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teo, Peggy; Yeoh, Brenda S.A.; Ong, Shir Nee","journal":"Health Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae987635ae296a89ef52a295a8939caeb266e3fa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132468.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851004002428; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851004002428","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzYxLmNzdjs3MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1711204,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"ofcdMqi/cHcC15hPDYGBHA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_61.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Using Singapore"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["foreign talent","foreign students","social lives of people","surveillance","foreign contract workers","management of infectious disease","social implications of strategies","social science aspects","biomedical knowledge","spread of SARS","Abstract Public health measures","tourism","holistic approach","businesses","effective response","understanding","global city status","local population","open economy","example of quick","island","ring of defense","state","case study","Singaporeans","right","discrimination","stressful circumstances","resentment","privacy","Marginalisation"],"language":"en"},

We built homology models based on SARS Mpro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of the binding mode to the known Mpro ligands, 4 drugs were selected for binding free energy calculations.

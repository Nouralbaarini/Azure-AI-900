The shedding of PRCV/TGEV was studied at different days post-arrival in fecal and nasal swabs from PRCV/TGEV seronegative sentinel pigs introduced into a PRCV seropositive herd with questionable TGEV serology and diarrhea. Nasal shedding of PRCV was detected in 57% and 63% of samples by nested-RT-PCR and cell culture immunofluorescence (CCIF), respectively. However fecal shedding of PRCV was detected in 37% of the samples by nested-RT-PCR and 19% by CCIF. Four respiratory and 5 fecal PRCV strains were isolated in swine testicle cells including nasal/fecal PRCV pairs (isolated at the same time) from 3 pigs. Comparison of nasal/fecal PRCV pairs from individual pigs revealed different deletions in the spike (S) gene (648 or 681 nt) in 2 pairs and a consistent change in nt 790/791 (aa T to V) for all pairs. In preliminary studies, inoculation of gnotobiotic pigs with each plaque-purified pair of the nasal and fecal PRCV isolates, revealed no clinical disease but different tropisms. The nasal isolate was shed both nasally and in feces, but the fecal isolate was shed only marginally in feces, and not nasally. Our results show that nested-RT-PCR was as sensitive as CCIF for PRCV detection in nasal swabs, but was more sensitive than CCIF for PRCV detection in fecal samples; alternatively PRCV shed in feces was more labile with loss of infectivity. The S-gene sequence differences found between the fecal and respiratory PRCV isolates may influence their tissue tropism. These new PRCV isolates should be useful to understand the molecular basis of coronavirus tropism and evolution in infected swine.","publish_time":"2003-11-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Costantini, V.; Lewis, P.; Alsop, J.; Templeton, C.; Saif, L.

Aff18-mer oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the initiation region of the mRNA coding for the spike protein and containing the intergenic consensus sequence of an enteric coronavirus has been tested for antiviral action against virus growth in human adenocarcinoma cells. The phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide only showed a limited effect on virus growth rate (from 12 to 34% viral inhibition in cells treated with 7.5 to 25 \u03BCM oligodeoxynucleotide, respectively, at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 infectious particle per cell). In the same conditions, the phosphorothioate analogue exhibited stronger antiviral activity, the inhibition increased from 56 to 90%. The inhibitory effect of this analogue was antisense and sequence-specific. Northern blot analysis showed that the sequence-dependent mechanism of action appears to be the inhibition of mRNA transcription. We conclude that the coronavirus intergenic consensus sequence is a good target for an antisense oligonucleotide antiviral action. The properties of the phosphodiester oligonucleotide was improved after its complexation with cyclodextrins. The most important increase of the antiviral activity (90% inhibition) was obtained with only 7.5 \u03BCM oligonucleotide complexed to a cyclodextrin derivative, 6-deoxy-6-S-\u03B2-D-galactopyranosyl-6-thio-cyclomaltoheptaose in a molar ratio of 1:100.

No data is available on HFNC use in the general pediatric ward. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of HFNC oxygen therapy in infants hospitalized in a pediatric ward for moderate\u2013severe bronchiolitis and to assess the changes in ventilatory parameters before and after starting HFNC support. This prospective observational pilot study was carried out during the bronchiolitis season 2011\u20132012 in a pediatric tertiary care academic center in Italy. Interruptions of HFNC therapy and possible side effects or escalation to other forms of respiratory support were recorded. Oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)), and respiratory rate (RR), measured for a baseline period of 1 h before and at specific time intervals in 48 h after the start of HFNC were recorded. Twenty-seven infants were included (median age 1.3 months; absolute range 0.3\u20138.5). No adverse events, no premature HFNC therapy termination, and no escalation to other forms of respiratory support were recorded. Median SpO(2) significantly increased by 1\u20132 points after changing from standard oxygen to HFNC (p \u003C0.001). Median ETCO(2) and RR rapidly decreased by 6\u20138 mmHg and 13\u201320 breaths per minute, respectively, in the first 3 h of HFNC therapy (p \u003C0.001) and remained steady thereafter. Conclusions: Use of HFNC for oxygen administration is feasible for infants with moderate\u2013severe bronchiolitis in a general pediatric ward. In these children, HFNC therapy improves oxygen saturation levels and seems to be associated with a decrease in both ETCO(2) and RR.","publish_time":"2013-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bressan, Silvia; Balzani, Marco; Krauss, Baruch; Pettenazzo, Andrea; Zanconato, Stefania; Baraldi, Eugenio","journal":"Eur J Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5b40d2f1601e017acf7c68ff5a819d5a767ec7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087157.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087157/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzgwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HFNC","ETCO","RR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HFNC support","HFNC use","Use of HFNC","h of HFNC therapy","start of HFNC","Interruptions of HFNC therapy","feasibility of HFNC oxygen therapy","premature HFNC therapy termination","severe bronchiolitis","general pediatric ward","infants","oxygen administration","standard oxygen","ventilatory support","forms of respiratory support","Median ETCO","oxygen saturation levels","bronchiolitis season","Median SpO","escalation","children","median age","respiratory rate","pediatric tertiary care academic center","ventilatory parameters","intensive care setting","prospective observational pilot study","Italy","effects","adverse events","specific time intervals","end-tidal carbon dioxide","months","absolute range","High-flow nasal cannula","changes","data","Conclusions","baseline period","breaths","points","minute","mmHg","aim","decrease"],"language":"en"},

All S1 and S2 peptides were antigenic, being recognised by IBV immune sera and also induced an antibody response following inoculation into chicks. Three S1-and one S2-bt peptides also induced a delayed type hypersensitivity response indicating the presence of T-cell epitopes. The S2 peptide Sp7 (amino acid position 566\u2013584) previously identified as an immundominant region, was the most antigenic of all peptides used in this study.

This study aimed at developing short-term forecasting models of daily ambulance calls using the 7-day weather forecast data as predictors. We employed the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method to analyze over 1.3 million cases of emergency attendance in May 2006 through April 2009 and the 7-day weather forecast data for the same period. Our results showed that the ARIMA model could offer reasonably accurate forecasts of daily ambulance calls at 1\u20137 days ahead of time and with improved accuracy by including weather factors. Specifically, the inclusion of average temperature alone in our ARIMA model improved the predictability of the 1-day forecast when compared to that of a simple ARIMA model (8.8 % decrease in the root mean square error, RMSE = 53 vs 58). The improvement in the 7-day forecast with average temperature as a predictor was more pronounced, with a 10 % drop in prediction error (RMSE = 62 vs 69). These findings suggested that weather forecast data can improve the 1- to 7-day forecasts of daily ambulance demand. As weather forecast data are readily accessible from Hong Kong Observatory\u2019s official website, there is virtually no cost to including them in the ARIMA models, which yield better prediction for forward planning and deployment of ambulance manpower.","publish_time":"2013-03-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Ho-Ting; Lai, Poh-Chin","journal":"Int J Biometeorol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e6bab81093c3d0f51f5460695ed8e422e86fb22.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087605.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087605/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozg1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARIMA"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["day weather forecast data","day forecasts of daily ambulance demand","weather factors","ARIMA models","ambulance services","accurate forecasts of daily ambulance","simple ARIMA model","deployment of ambulance manpower","short-term forecasting models of daily ambulance calls","inclusion of average temperature","prediction error","RMSE","vs","better prediction","autoregressive integrated moving average","square error","improved accuracy","Hong Kong Observatory\u2019s official website","forward planning","method","role","humidity","predictability","predictors","time","study","root","days","period","findings","cases of emergency attendance","cost","results","improvement"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, these devices require micropumps to distribute amplification mixture into an array of reactors, thereby increasing the device cost, and adding complexity to the chip fabrication and operation processes. To overcome these limitations, we report microfluidic devices harboring open (unsealed) reactors in conjunction with a single-step capillary based flow scheme for sequential distribution of amplification mixture into an array of reactors. Concern about evaporative loss in unsealed reactors have been addressed by optimized reactor design, smooth internal reactor surfaces, and incorporation of a localized heating scheme for the reactors, in which isothermal, real-time helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) was performed.","publish_time":"2009-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramalingam, Naveen; San, Tong Chee; Kai, Teo Jin; Mak, Matthew Yew Mun; Gong, Hai-Qing","journal":"Microfluid Nanofluidics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/91a672be533dd4bc35a9415bbef7470bc4ba3505.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087983.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087983/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozk0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unsealed reactors","array of reactors","high-throughput nucleic-acid amplification devices","fluidically connected reactors","sequential distribution of amplification mixture","microfluidic devices","real-time helicase-dependent amplification","High-throughput microchip devices","reactor sealing","evaporative loss","optimized reactor design","smooth internal reactor surfaces","localized heating scheme","single-step capillary based flow scheme","incorporation","conjunction","complexity","isothermal","chip fabrication","HDA","cross-contamination","Concern","operation processes","device cost","micropumps","microvalves","limitations"],"language":"en"},

These three diseases have very different clinical courses and distinctive pathological features, although all share the essential element of demyelination. ADEM and PML have antithetic modes of pathogenesis. ADEM is a predominantly extraneural infection resulting in a virus-induced host autoimmune response, whereas PML is a direct lytic infection of oligodendrocytes in an immunocompromised host. It is clear that a diverse array of viruses can infect the human central nervous system. The viral infections can result in a wide variety of clinical and pathological symptoms. While some viruses may cause widespread inflammation and neurodegeneration, other viruses may remain latent in the CNS and only produce pathological changes during reactivation. Viral induced demyelination can occur both from direct infection of the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, as in PML, or by indirect mechanisms that have yet to be determined. The outcome of a viral CNS infection depends not only on viral characteristics, but also on the interaction between virus and host cell.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Johnson, Richard T.; Major, Eugene O.","journal":"Myelin Biology and Disorders","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1926509a6cb035d657c351f7ffed2656469fd78b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124395107500930; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124395107500930","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ADEM"],"organizations":["CNS","PML"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PML","viral CNS infection","direct infection","ADEM","Viral induced demyelination","extraneural infection","viral infections","viral characteristics","direct lytic infection of oligodendrocytes","human CNS demyelinating diseases","pathological symptoms","pathological changes","immunocompromised host","host cell","virus-induced host autoimmune response","distinctive pathological features","diverse array of viruses","postinfectious encephalomyelitis","different clinical courses","wide variety of clinical","acute disseminated encephalomyelitis","essential element of demyelination","human central nervous system","progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy","chapter","neurodegeneration","interaction","widespread inflammation","antithetic modes of pathogenesis","multiple sclerosis","outcome","Publisher Summary","reactivation","indirect mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

The objectives of this study were to assess early risk factors for severe PJP and 90-day mortality, including the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid cytology profiles at diagnosis. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled all patients meeting pre-defined diagnostic criteria for PJP admitted at Nantes university hospital, France, from January 2012 to January 2017. Diagnostic criteria for PJP were typical clinical features with microbiological confirmation of P. jirovecii cysts by direct examination or a positive specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Severe PJP was defined as hypoxemic acute respiratory failure requiring high-flow nasal oxygen with at least 50% FiO(2), non-invasive ventilation, or MV. RESULTS: Of 2446 respiratory samples investigated during the study period, 514 from 430 patients were positive for P. jirovecii. Of these 430 patients, 107 met criteria for PJP and were included in the study, 53 (49.5%) patients had severe PJP, including 30 who required MV. All patients were immunocompromised with haematological malignancy ranking first (n = 37, 35%), followed by solid organ transplantation (n = 27, 25%), HIV-infection (n = 21, 20%), systemic diseases (n = 13, 12%), solid tumors (n = 12, 11%) and primary immunodeficiency (n = 6, 8%). By multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with severity were older age (OR, 3.36; 95% CI 1.4\u20138.5; p \u003C 0.05), a P. jirovecii microscopy-positive result from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (OR, 1.3; 95% CI 1.54\u20139.3; p \u003C 0.05); and absence of a BAL fluid alveolitis profile (OR, 3.2; 95% CI 1.27\u20138.8; p \u003C 0.04). The 90-day mortality rate was 27%, increasing to 50% in the severe PJP group. Factors independently associated with 90-day mortality were worse SOFA score on day 1 (OR, 1.05; 95% CI 1.02\u20131.09; p \u003C 0.001) whereas alveolitis at BAL was protective (OR, 0.79; 95% CI 0.65\u20130.96; p \u003C 0.05). In the subgroup of HIV-negative patients, similar findings were obtained, then viral co-infection were independently associated with higher 90-day mortality (OR, 1.25; 95% CI 1.02\u20131.55; p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Older age and P. jirovecii oocysts at microscopic examination of BAL were independently associated with severe PJP. Both initial PJP severity as evaluated by the SOFA score and viral co-infection predicted 90-day mortality. Alveolitis at BAL examination was associated with less severe PJP. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying this observation deserves further investigation.","publish_time":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gaborit, Benjamin Jean; Tessoulin, Benoit; Lavergne, Rose-Anne; Morio, Florent; Sagan, Christine; Canet, Emmanuel; Lecomte, Raphael; Leturnier, Paul; Deschanvres, Colin; Khatchatourian, Lydie; Asseray, Nathalie; Garret, Charlotte; Vourch, Michael; Marest, Delphine; Raffi, Fran\u00E7ois; Boutoille, David; Reignier, Jean","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a2c92cb3474488b76d0f262e76e9b027a72e48e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6881486.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6881486/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzI50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumocystis"],"organizations":["PJP","Nantes","MV","BAL"],"locations":["France"],"keyphrases":["severe PJP group","initial PJP severity","day mortality rate","BAL examination","severe disease","negative patients","jirovecii cysts","jirovecii oocysts","microscopic examination of BAL","MV","BAL fluid alveolitis profile","jirovecii microscopy-positive result","HIV-infection","Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia","viral co-infection","direct examination","pre-defined diagnostic criteria","older age","study period","worse SOFA score","early risk factors","bronchoalveolar lavage","respiratory samples","non-invasive ventilation","subgroup of HIV","solid tumors","high rates of invasive mechanical ventilation","broncho-alveolar lavage fluid cytology profiles","positive specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction","solid organ transplantation","hypoxemic acute respiratory failure","high-flow nasal oxygen","microbiological confirmation of","typical clinical features","PCR","similar findings","diagnosis","Nantes university hospital","absence","assay","FiO","haematological malignancy","BACKGROUND","observation","France","CONCLUSIONS","pathophysiological mechanism","multivariate analysis","systemic diseases","primary immunodeficiency","investigation","RESULTS","objectives","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The large economic impact of PED on the swine industry worldwide has made the development of an effective PED vaccine a necessity. S0, a truncated region of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spike protein, has been suggested as a candidate antigen for PED subunit vaccines; however, poor solubility problems when the protein is expressed in Escherichia coli, and the inherent problems of subunit vaccines, such as low immunogenicity, remain. Flagellin has been widely used as a fusion partner to enhance the immunogenicity and solubility of many difficult-to-express proteins; however, the conjugation effect of flagellin varies depending on the target antigen or the position of the fusion placement. Here, we conjugated flagellin, Vibrio vulnificus FlaB, to the N- and C-termini of S0 and evaluated the ability of the fusion to enhance the solubility and immunogenicity of S0. Flagellin conjugation in the presence of the trigger factor chaperone tig greatly improved the solubility of the fusion protein (up to 99%) regardless of its conjugation position. Of importance, flagellin conjugated to the N-terminus of S0 significantly enhanced S0-specific humoral immune responses compared to other recombinant antigens in Balb/c mice. The mechanism of this phenomenon was investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies. These findings provide important information for the development of a novel PED vaccine and flagellin-based immunotherapeutics.","publish_time":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oh, Seo-ho; Kim Cho, Young-Saeng; Lee, Ho-Bin; Lee, Sang-Mok; Kim, Whee-Soo; Hong, Liang; Cho, Chong-Su; Choi, Yun-Jaie; Kang, Sang-Kee","journal":"J Vet Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/595ec9383d19b691e17362abb472fa1103074014.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6883195.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6883195/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Flagellin conjugation","immunogenicity of S0","fusion protein","conjugation effect of flagellin","PED subunit vaccines","novel PED vaccine","effective PED vaccine","flagellin-based immunotherapeutics","conjugation position","fusion partner","fusion placement","poor solubility problems","development","large economic impact of PED","spike protein","low immunogenicity","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","inherent problems of subunit vaccines","enhanced S0-specific humoral immune responses","N-terminus","swine industry","candidate antigen","c mice","C-termini","target antigen","contagious enteric swine disease","recombinant antigens","presence","PEDV","truncated region","trigger factor chaperone tig","Balb","Escherichia coli","Vibrio vulnificus FlaB","important information","express proteins","findings","necessity","ability","importance","mechanism","phenomenon","studies"],"language":"en"},

While testing/removal and vaccination led to a decreased prevalence of FeLV, recently, this decrease has reportedly stagnated in some countries. This study aimed to prospectively determine the prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats taken to veterinary facilities in 32 European countries. FeLV viral RNA was semiquantitatively detected in saliva, using RT-qPCR as a measure of viraemia. Risk and protective factors were assessed using an online questionnaire to report geographic, demographic, husbandry, FeLV vaccination, and clinical data. The overall prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats visiting a veterinary facility, of which 10.4% were shelter and rescue cats, was 2.3% (141/6005; 95% CI: 2.0%\u20132.8%) with the highest prevalences in Portugal, Hungary, and Italy/Malta (5.7%\u20138.8%). Using multivariate analysis, seven risk factors (Southern Europe, male intact, 1\u20136 years of age, indoor and outdoor or outdoor-only living, living in a group of \u22655 cats, illness), and three protective factors (Northern Europe, Western Europe, pedigree cats) were identified. Using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, the origin of cats in Europe, pedigree, and access to outdoors were important predictors of FeLV status. FeLV-infected sick cats shed more viral RNA than FeLV-infected healthy cats, and they suffered more frequently from anaemia, anorexia, and gingivitis/stomatitis than uninfected sick cats. Most cats had never been FeLV-vaccinated; vaccination rates were indirectly associated with the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. In conclusion, we identified countries where FeLV was undetectable, demonstrating that the infection can be eradicated and highlighting those regions where awareness and prevention should be increased.","publish_time":"2019-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Studer, Nadine; Lutz, Hans; Saegerman, Claude; G\u00F6nczi, Enik\u00F6; Meli, Marina L.; Boo, Gianluca; Hartmann, Katrin; Hosie, Margaret J.; Moestl, Karin; Tasker, S\u00E9verine; Bel\u00E1k, S\u00E1ndor; Lloret, Albert; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman F.; Pennisi, Maria-Grazia; Truyen, Uwe; Frymus, Tadeusz; Thiry, Etienne; Marsilio, Fulvio; Addie, Diane; Hochleithner, Manfred; Tkalec, Filip; Vizi, Zsuzsanna; Brunetti, Anna; Georgiev, Boyko; Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F.; Tschuor, Flurin; Mooney, Carmel T.; Eliasson, Catarina; Orro, Janne; Johansen, Helle; Juuti, Kirsi; Krampl, Igor; Kovalenko, Kaspars; \u0160engaut, Jakov; Sobral, Cristina; Borska, Petra; Kova\u0159\u00EDkov\u00E1, Simona; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9764af198bccd196d117b460ad8112059b4f6b00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6893802.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893802/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Hungary","Southern Europe"],"keyphrases":["FeLV vaccination","infected cats","FeLV-infected sick cats","FeLV-infected healthy cats","pedigree cats","origin of cats","rescue cats","FeLV viral RNA","decreased prevalence of FeLV","uninfected sick cats","overall prevalence of FeLV viraemia","important predictors of FeLV status","Western Europe","Southern Europe","Northern Europe","protective factors","risk factors","measure of viraemia","vaccination rates","European countries","veterinary facilities","veterinary facility","multivariate analysis","gingivitis","outdoors","demographic","Hungary","CART","access","stomatitis","husbandry","years of age","online questionnaire","Portugal","regression tree","saliva","retrovirus","fatal disease","illness","RT-qPCR","gross domestic product","clinical data","Feline leukaemia virus","GDP","Italy","highest prevalences","classification","anorexia","removal","regions","awareness","prevention","Malta","anaemia","testing","group","conclusion","infection","study"],"language":"en"},

Aim of the present study was to assess whether non-communicable diseases increase the risk for severe imported falciparum malaria. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of all adult cases with imported falciparum malaria hospitalized between 2001 and 2015 in the tertiary care Charit\u00E9 University Hospital, Berlin, was performed. RESULTS: A total of 536 adult patients (median age 37 years; 31.3% female) were enrolled. Of these, 329 (61.4%) originated from endemic countries, 207 patients (38.6%) from non-endemic regions. Criteria for severe malaria were fulfilled in 68 (12.7%) cases. With older age, lack of previous malaria episodes, being a tourist, and delayed presentation, well-characterized risk factors were associated with severe malaria in univariate analysis. After adjustment for these potential confounders hypertension (adjusted odds ratio aOR, 3.06 95% confidence interval, CI 1.34\u20137.02), cardiovascular diseases (aOR, 8.20 95% CI 2.30\u201329.22), and dyslipidaemia (aOR, 6.08 95% CI 1.13\u201332.88) were individual diseases associated with severe disease in multivariable logistic regression. Hypertension proved an independent risk factor among individuals of endemic (aOR, 4.83, 95% CI 1.44\u201316.22) as well as of non-endemic origin (aOR, 3.60 95% CI 1.05\u201312.35).

The majority of these are in non-coding regions, and are commonly assigned to the nearest gene along the genome. However, this approach neglects the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and the fact that the genome contains arrays of extremely conserved non-coding elements termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), which can be utilized to detect genes under long-range developmental regulation. Here we review a GRB-based approach to assign loci in non-coding regions to potential target genes, and apply it to reanalyse the results of one of the largest schizophrenia GWAS (SWG PGC, 2014). We further apply this approach to GWAS data from two related neuropsychiatric disorders\u2014autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder\u2014to show that it is applicable to developmental disorders in general. We find that disease-associated SNPs are overrepresented in GRBs and that the GRB model is a powerful tool for linking these SNPs to their correct target genes under long-range regulation. Our analysis identifies novel genes not previously implicated in schizophrenia and corroborates a number of predicted targets from the original study. The results are available as an online resource in which the genomic context and the strength of enhancer\u2013promoter associations can be browsed for each schizophrenia-associated SNP.","publish_time":"2019-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bare\u0161i\u0107, Anja; Nash, Alexander Jolyon; Dahoun, Tarik; Howes, Oliver; Lenhard, Boris","journal":"Mol Psychiatry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bad0c1f850ad12ecc4c12001bd5f512aea11f4cb.json; document_parses/pdf_json/08e8cd9cddb6f5f55f2f08a36fb5458c3d643344.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6906185.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6906185/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzYy0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GWAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-coding regions","developmental disorders","novel genes","potential target genes","correct target genes","schizophrenia-associated SNP","conserved non-coding elements","related neuropsychiatric disorders","GRBs","largest schizophrenia GWAS","GRB-based approach","long-range regulation","long-range developmental regulation","disease-associated SNPs","results","Recent genome-wide association studies","assign loci","numerous loci","genomic context","bipolar disorder","GWAS data","GRB model","autism spectrum disorder","genomic regulatory blocks","arrays","strength of enhancer","online resource","number of predicted targets","powerful tool","SWG PGC","original study","promoter associations","three-dimensional organisation","fact","nearest gene","analysis","majority"],"language":"en"},

In an Ebola treatment center in Liberia, EVD patients receiving the combination antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine had a lower risk of death compared to those treated with artemether-lumefantrine. As artemether and artesunate are derivatives of artemisinin, the beneficial anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) effect observed could possibly be attributed to the change from lumefantrine to amodiaquine. Amodiaquine is a widely used antimalarial in the countries that experience outbreaks of EVD and, therefore, holds promise as an approved drug that could be repurposed for treating EBOV infections. We investigated the potential anti-EBOV effect of amodiaquine in a well-characterized nonhuman primate model of EVD. Using a similar 3-day antimalarial dosing strategy as for human patients, plasma concentrations of amodiaquine in healthy animals were similar to those found in humans. However, the treatment regimen did not result in a survival benefit or decrease of disease signs in EBOV-infected animals. While amodiaquine on its own failed to demonstrate efficacy, we cannot exclude potential therapeutic value of amodiaquine when used in combination with artesunate or another antiviral.","publish_time":"2019-12-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"DeWald, Lisa Evans; Johnson, Joshua C.; Gerhardt, Dawn M.; Torzewski, Lisa M.; Postnikova, Elena; Honko, Anna N.; Janosko, Krisztina; Huzella, Louis; Dowling, William E.; Eakin, Ann E.; Osborn, Blaire L.; Gahagen, Janet; Tang, Liang; Green, Carol E.; Mirsalis, Jon C.; Holbrook, Michael R.; Jahrling, Peter B.; Dyall, Julie; Hensley, Lisa E.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93ad47dfe9435a6c7dac0510494626398fbe5ca2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6934550.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6934550/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozkz0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","EBOV","EVD"],"locations":["Western Africa","Liberia"],"keyphrases":["EVD patients","combination antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine","antimalarial treatment","potential anti-EBOV effect of amodiaquine","outbreaks of EVD","plasma concentrations of amodiaquine","potential therapeutic value of amodiaquine","EBOV infections","Ebola virus disease","EBOV-infected animals","Ebola treatment center","human patients","beneficial anti-Ebola virus","treatment regimen","artemether-lumefantrine","day antimalarial dosing strategy","well-characterized nonhuman primate model of EVD","disease signs","healthy animals","accordance","high coexisting malaria burden","derivatives of artemisinin","epidemic","Liberia","World Health Organization guidelines","lower risk of death","survival benefit","Western Africa","efficacy","countries","antiviral","change","approved drug","humans"],"language":"en"},

When tested for, the diagnosis and treatment of influenza are often delayed due to the slow turnaround times of centralised laboratory PCR testing. Newer molecular systems, have comparable accuracy to laboratory PCR testing, and can generate a result in under 1 hour, making them potentially deployable as point-of-care tests (POCTs). High-quality evidence for the impact of routine POCT for influenza on clinical outcomes is, however, currently lacking. This large pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial aims to address this evidence gap. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The FluPOC trial is a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial evaluating adults admitted to a large teaching hospital and a district general hospital with an acute respiratory illness, during influenza season and defined by Public Health England. Up to 840 patients will be recruited over up to three influenza seasons, and randomised (1:1) to receive either POCT using the FilmArray respiratory panel, or routine clinical care. Clinical and infection control teams will be informed of the results in real time and where influenza is detected clinical teams will be encouraged to offer neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) treatment in accordance with national guidelines. Those allocated to standard clinical care will have a swab taken for later analysis to allow assessment of missed diagnoses. The outcomes assessment will be by retrospective case note analysis. The outcome measures include the proportion of influenza-positive patients detected and appropriately treated with NAIs, isolation facility use, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, complications and mortality. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Prior to commencing the study, approval was obtained from the South Central Hampshire A Ethics Committee (reference 17/SC/0368, granted 7 September 2017).

They are involved in cellular processes such as inflammation and tissue homeostasis. PG production is not restricted to multicellular organisms. Trypanosomatids also synthesize several metabolites of arachidonic acid. Nevertheless, their biological role in these early-branching parasites and their role in host-parasite interaction are not well elucidated. Prostaglandin F(2\u03B1) synthase (PGF2S) has been observed in the Leishmania braziliensis secreted proteome and in L. donovani extracellular vesicles. Furthermore, we previously reported a positive correlation between L. braziliensis PGF2S (LbrPGF2S) expression and pathogenicity in mice. METHODS: LbrPGF2S gene expression and PGF2\u03B1 synthesis in promastigotes were detected and quantified by western blotting and EIA assay kit, respectively. To investigate LbrPGF2S localization in amastigotes during bone marrow-derived macrophage infection, parasites expressing mCherry-LbrPGF2S were generated and followed by time-lapse imaging for 48 h post-infection. PGF2S homolog sequences from Leishmania and humans were analyzed in silico using ClustalW on Geneious v6 and EMBOSS Needle. RESULTS: Leishmania braziliensis promastigotes synthesize prostaglandin F(2\u03B1) in the presence of arachidonic acid, with peak production in the stationary growth phase under heat stress. LbrPGF2S is a cytoplasmic protein enriched in the secretory site of the parasite cell body, the flagellar pocket. It is an enzyme constitutively expressed throughout promastigote development, but overexpression of LbrPGF2S leads to an increase of infectivity in vitro. The data suggest that LbrPGF2S may be released from intracellular amastigotes into the cytoplasm of bone marrow-derived macrophages over a 48-hour infection period, using time-lapse microscopy and mCherry-PGF2S (mChPGF2S)-expressing parasites. CONCLUSIONS: LbrPGF2S, a parasite-derived protein, is targeted to the host cell cytoplasm. The putative transfer of this enzyme, involved in pro-inflammatory lipid mediator synthesis, to the host cell suggests a potential role in host-parasite interaction and may partially explain the increased pathogenicity associated with overexpression of LbrPGF2S in L. braziliensis. Our data provide valuable insights to help understand the importance of parasite-derived lipid mediators in pathogenesis.

However, data regarding the clinical outcomes of this approach are lacking. The objective of this multicenter prospective observational cohort study was to evaluate lung transplantation outcomes in Korean Organ Transplantation Registry (KOTRY) patients for whom ECMO was used as a bridge to transplantation. METHODS: Between March 2015 and December 2017, a total of 112 patients received lung transplantation and were registered in the KOTRY, which is a prospective, multicenter cohort registry. The entire cohort was divided into two groups: the control group (n = 85, 75.9%) and bridge-ECMO group (n = 27, 24.1%). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in pre-transplant and intraoperative characteristics except for poorer oxygenation, more ventilator use, and longer operation time in the bridge-ECMO group. The prevalence of primary graft dysfunction at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after transplantation did not differ between the two groups. Although postoperative hospital stays were longer in the bridge-ECMO group than in the control group, hospital mortality did not differ between the two groups (25.9% vs. 13.3%, P = 0.212). The majority of patients (70.4% of the bridge-ECMO group and 77.6% of the control group) were discharged directly to their homes. Finally, the use of ECMO as a bridge to lung transplantation did not significantly affect overall survival and graft function.

Evidence evaluating the association between NOAF and patient-important outcomes in this population is conflicting. Furthermore, little is known regarding the association between NOAF and resource use or hospital costs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis (2011\u20132016) of a prospectively collected registry from two Canadian hospitals of consecutive ICU patients aged \u2265 18 years. We excluded patients with a known history of AF prior to hospital admission. Any occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) was prospectively recorded by bedside nurses. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and we used multivariable logistic regression to adjust for confounders. We used a generalized linear model to evaluate contributors to total cost. RESULTS: We included 15,014 patients, and 1541 (10.3%) had NOAF during their ICU admission. While NOAF was not associated with increased odds of hospital death among the entire cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.02 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97\u20131.08]), an interaction was noted between NOAF and sepsis, and the presence of both was associated with higher odds of hospital mortality (aOR 1.28 [95% CI 1.09\u20131.36]) than either alone. Patients with NOAF had higher total costs (cost ratio [CR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.02\u20131.20]). Among patients with NOAF, treatment with a rhythm-control strategy was associated with higher costs (CR 1.24 [95% CI 1.07\u20131.40]). CONCLUSIONS: While NOAF was not associated with death or requiring discharge to long-term care among critically ill patients, it was associated with increased length of stay in ICU and increased total costs.","publish_time":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fernando, Shannon M.; Mathew, Rebecca; Hibbert, Benjamin; Rochwerg, Bram; Munshi, Laveena; Walkey, Allan J.; M\u00F8ller, Morten Hylander; Simard, Trevor; Di Santo, Pietro; Ramirez, F.

In this study, we utilized the baculovirus system to evaluate the expression of three Pfs48/45 proteins including the full-length protein, the 6C domain fragment and the 6C domain mutant to prevent glycosylation. Expression of the recombinant Pfs48/45 proteins was conducted in super Sf9 cells combined with the use of tunicamycin to prevent N-glycosylation. The proteins were then evaluated as immunogens in mice to demonstrate the induction of functionally active polyclonal antibody responses as measured in the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA). Only the 6C protein was found to exhibit significant transmission-reducing activity. Further characterization of the biologically active 6C protein demonstrated it was homogeneous in terms of size, charge, conformation, absence of glycosylation, and containing proper disulfide bond pairings.

The aim of this study was to determine the innate immune mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to frequent exacerbations in COPD. We measured sputum expression of immune mediators and bacterial loads in samples from patients with COPD at stable state and during virus-associated exacerbations. In vitro immune responses to rhinovirus infection in differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) sampled from patients with COPD were additionally evaluated. Patients were stratified as frequent exacerbators (\u22652 exacerbations in the preceding year) or infrequent exacerbators (\u003C2 exacerbations in the preceding year) with comparisons made between these groups. Frequent exacerbators had reduced sputum cell mRNA expression of the antiviral immune mediators type I and III interferons and reduced interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression when clinically stable and during virus-associated exacerbation. A role for epithelial cell-intrinsic innate immune dysregulation was identified: induction of interferons and ISGs during in vitro rhinovirus (RV) infection was also impaired in differentiated BECs from frequent exacerbators. Frequent exacerbators additionally had increased sputum bacterial loads at 2 wk following virus-associated exacerbation onset. These data implicate deficient airway innate immunity involving epithelial cells in the increased propensity to exacerbations observed in some patients with COPD. Therapeutic approaches to boost innate antimicrobial immunity in the lung could be a viable strategy for prevention and treatment of frequent exacerbations.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singanayagam, Aran; Loo, Su-Ling; Calderazzo, Maria; Finney, Lydia J.; Trujillo Torralbo, Maria-Belen; Bakhsoliani, Eteri; Girkin, Jason; Veerati, Punnam; Pathinayake, Prabuddha S.; Nichol, Kristy S.; Reid, Andrew; Footitt, Joseph; Wark, Peter A.

Up to 60% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients meet the pharmacodynamic targets of beta-lactam antibiotics, with only 30% in fluoroquinolones. Not reaching these targets might increase the chance of therapeutic failure, resulting in increased mortality and morbidity, and antibiotic resistance. The DOLPHIN trial was designed to demonstrate the added value of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones in critically ill patients in the ICU. METHODS: A multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) was designed to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of model-based TDM of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones. Four hundred fifty patients will be included within 24 months after start of inclusion. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to either study group: the intervention group (active TDM) or the control group (non-TDM). In the intervention group dose adjustment of the study antibiotics (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, flucloxacillin, piperacillin with tazobactam, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin) on day 1, 3, and 5 is performed based upon TDM with a Bayesian model. The primary outcome will be ICU length of stay. Other outcomes amongst all survival, disease severity, safety, quality of life after ICU discharge, and cost effectiveness will be included. DISCUSSION: No trial has investigated the effect of early TDM of beta-lactam and fluoroquinolones on clinical outcome in critically ill patients. The findings from the DOLPHIN trial will possibly lead to new insights in clinical management of critically ill patients receiving antibiotics. In short, to TDM or not to TDM?

The disease is caused by infections with parasitic blood flukes known as schistosomes. The control of schistosomiasis over the last several decades has been centered on the mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel (PZQ), which is the only drug currently available for treatment. Despite the concerted efforts of MDA programs, the prevalence and transmission of schistosomiasis has remained largely unchecked due to the fact that PZQ is ineffective against juvenile schistosomes, does not prevent re-infection and the emergence of PZQ-resistant parasites. In addition, other measures such as the water, sanitation and hygiene programs and snail intermediate hosts control have had little to no impact. These drawbacks indicate that the current control strategies are severely inadequate at interrupting transmission and therefore, implementation of other control strategies are required. Ideally, an efficient vaccine is what is needed for long term protection thereby eliminating the current efforts of repeated mass drug administration. However, the general consensus in the field is that the integration of a viable vaccine with MDA and other control measures offer the best chance of achieving the goal of schistosomiasis elimination. This review focuses on the present status of schistosomiasis vaccine candidates in different phases of human clinical trials and provide some insight into future vaccine discovery and design.","publish_time":"2020-01-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Molehin, Adebayo J.","journal":"J Biomed Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f473743ab5512de8b4e42b5480fd76ea2facad0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6977295.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6977295/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzIzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDA","PZQ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["control of schistosomiasis","control measures","transmission of schistosomiasis","current control strategies","viable vaccine","efficient vaccine","present status of schistosomiasis vaccine candidates","goal of schistosomiasis elimination","concerted efforts of MDA programs","current efforts of repeated mass drug administration","snail intermediate hosts control","future vaccine discovery","emergence of PZQ","hygiene programs","interrupting transmission","juvenile schistosomes","insight","different phases of human clinical trials","sanitation","mortality","prevalence","significant levels of morbidity","re-infection","best chance","parasitic blood flukes","infections","geographical regions","fact","design","water","long term protection","integration","implementation","praziquantel","field","resistant parasites","drawbacks","general consensus","world","disease","review","treatment","decades","addition","impact"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) in central Taiwan. Patients in the ICU with sepsis between January 2014 and December 2015 were included for analysis. All of these patients received protocol-based management, including blood sugar monitoring every 2 h for the first 24 h of ICU admission. Mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and coefficient of variation (CoV) were used to assess GV. RESULTS: A total of 452 patients (mean age 71.4 \u00B1 14.7 years; 76.7% men) were enrolled for analysis. They were divided into high GV (43.4%, 196/452) and low GV (56.6%, 256/512) groups using MAGE 65 mg/dL as the cut-off point. Patients with high GV tended to have higher HbA1c (6.7 \u00B1 1.8% vs. 5.9 \u00B1 0.9%, p \u003C 0.01) and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus (DM) (50.0% vs. 23.4%, p \u003C 0.01) compared with those in the low GV group. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that a high GV was associated with increased 30-day mortality (log-rank test, p = 0.018). The association remained strong in the non-DM (log-rank test, p = 0.035), but not in the DM (log-rank test, p = 0.254) group. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified that high APACHE II score (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.045, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.013\u20131.078), high serum lactate level at 0 h (aHR 1.009, 95% CI 1.003\u20131.014), having chronic airway disease (aHR 0.478, 95% CI 0.302\u20130.756), high mean day 1 glucose (aHR 1.008, 95% CI 1.000\u20131.016), and high MAGE (aHR 1.607, 95% CI 1.008\u20132.563) were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. The association with 30-day mortality remained consistent when using CoV to assess GV. CONCLUSIONS: We found that approximately 40% of the septic patients had a high early GV, defined as MAGE \u003E 65 mg/dL. Higher GV within 24 h of ICU admission was independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. These findings highlight the need to monitor GV in septic patients early during an ICU admission.","publish_time":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chao, Wen-Cheng; Tseng, Chien-Hua; Wu, Chieh-Liang; Shih, Sou-Jen; Yi, Chi-Yuan; Chan, Ming-Cheng","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f49d992c5998e86bd5f49f0ba70a6a99b0e07d2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7007493.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7007493/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzMyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","MAGE"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["high GV","high early GV","Higher GV","high MAGE","high mean day","low GV group","high APACHE","aHR","septic patients","day mortality","ill patients","High glycemic variability","h of ICU admission","mortality association","high serum lactate level","log-rank test","Meier analysis","mean age","CoV","sepsis","Mean amplitude of glycemic excursions","Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis","higher HbA1c","adjusted hazard ratio","score","prevalence","medical intensive care unit","protocol-based management","glucose","blood sugar","retrospective cohort study","coefficient of variation","total","need","BACKGROUND","chronic airway disease","central Taiwan","confidence interval","METHODS","years","diabetes mellitus","Kaplan","RESULTS","findings","cut-off point","groups","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Initial interaction between DCs and viruses facilitates cell activation and migration to secondary lymphoid tissues, where these antigen presenting cells (APCs) prime specific adaptive immune responses. Some viruses, however, have evolved strategies to subvert the migratory capacity of DCs as a way to disseminate infection systemically. Here we focus on the role of Siglec-1, a sialic acid-binding type I lectin receptor potently upregulated by type I interferons on DCs, that acts as a double edge sword, containing viral replication through the induction of antiviral immunity, but also favoring viral spread within tissues. Such is the case for distant enveloped viruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or Ebola virus (EBOV), which incorporate sialic acid-containing gangliosides on their viral membrane and are effectively recognized by Siglec-1. Here we review how Siglec-1 is highly induced on the surface of human DCs upon viral infection, the way this impacts different antigen presentation pathways, and how enveloped viruses have evolved to exploit these APC functions as a potent dissemination strategy in different anatomical compartments.","publish_time":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perez-Zsolt, Daniel; Martinez-Picado, Javier; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc763a4c1cb0175d61d1332af8d137d0482df73b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7019426.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019426/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzM1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["APC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["incoming viruses","viral infection","distant enveloped viruses","surface of human DCs","viral replication","viral spread","viral membrane","migratory capacity of DCs","Dendritic cells","role of Siglec","sialic acid-binding type","human immunodeficiency virus","different antigen presentation pathways","Ebola virus","different anatomical compartments","secondary lymphoid tissues","potent dissemination strategy","APCs","cell activation","migration","HIV","prime specific adaptive immune responses","lectin receptor","induction of antiviral immunity","APC functions","double edge sword","EBOV","gangliosides","case","mucosal portals of entry","Initial interaction","strategies","interferons"],"language":"en"},

Stochastic population data cause oscillations to be sustained rather than damped, and data analysis regarding the oscillations provides insights into the same set of population data. Notably, oscillations arise naturally from the model, instead of from a periodic forcing term or other exogenous mechanism that guarantees oscillation: the model has no such mechanism. These emergent natural oscillations display appropriate periodicity for smallpox, even when the model is applied to different locations and populations. The model and datasets, in turn, offer new observations about disease dynamics and solution trajectories.

The consequences on pathogen-specific immune responses are not well known. This study evaluated and compared the humoral responses specific to merozoite stage vaccine candidates of Plasmodium falciparum, in children differentially exposed to Anopheles bites in a natural setting. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was carried out in Bouak\u00E9 (C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire) where entomological data and blood samples from children (0\u201314 years) were collected in two sites with similar malaria prevalence. Antibody (IgG, IgG1, IgG3) responses to PfAMA1 and PfMSP1 were evaluated by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to assess the relationship between the immune responses to P. falciparum antigens and exposure to Anopheles bites in the total cohort and in each site, separately. The individual level of exposure to Anopheles bites was evaluated by quantifying specific IgG response to the Anopheles gSG6-P1 salivary peptide, which represents a proxy of Anopheles exposure. RESULTS: The anti-Plasmodium humoral responses were different according to the level of exposure of children, with those highly exposed to Anopheles presenting significantly lower antibody responses to PfMSP1 in total population (IgG and IgG3) and in Petessou village (IgG, IgG1, IgG3). No significant difference was seen for PfAMA1 antigen between children differently exposed to Anopheles. In Dar-es-Salam, a neighbourhood where a high Culex density was reported, children presented very low antibody levels specific to both antigens, and no difference according to the exposure to Anopheles bites was found. CONCLUSION: These findings may suggest that immunomodulatory components of Anopheles saliva, in addition to other factors, may participate to the modulation of the humoral response specific to Plasmodium merozoite stage antigens. This epidemiological observation may form a starting point for additional work to decipher the role of mosquito saliva on the modulation of the anti-Plasmodium acquired immunity and clinical protection in combining both field and ex vivo immunological studies.","publish_time":"2020-02-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aka, Kakou G.; Traor\u00E9, Dipomin F.; Sagna, Andr\u00E9 B.; Zoh, Dounin D.; Assi, Serge B.; Tchiekoi, Bertin N\u2019cho; Adja, Akr\u00E9 M.; Remoue, Franck; Poinsignon, Anne","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/067811215e2e69471101d2e2995f14754f1383eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7033907.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033907/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Petessou"],"keyphrases":["Anopheles bites","children","proxy of Anopheles exposure","humoral responses specific","anti-Plasmodium humoral responses","immunomodulatory components of Anopheles saliva","specific IgG response","pathogen-specific immune responses","humoral response specific","lower antibody responses","IgG3","Anopheles gSG6-P1 salivary peptide","Plasmodium merozoite stage antigens","individual level of exposure","falciparum antigens","low antibody levels specific","merozoite stage vaccine candidates of Plasmodium falciparum","immunomodulatory salivary components","modulation","PfMSP1","IgG1","mosquito blood feeding","role of mosquito saliva","total population","total cohort","blood samples","PfAMA1 antigen","significant difference","cross-sectional study","malaria-endemic areas","similar malaria prevalence","entomological data","human populations","clinical protection","starting point","neighbourhood","field","Bouak\u00E9","immunity","Petessou village","additional work","C\u00F4te d\u2019Ivoire","high Culex density","Salam","sites","consequences","RESULTS","immunological studies","epidemiological observation","BACKGROUND","findings","factors","relationship","natural setting","multivariate analysis","Dar-es","METHODS","ELISA","years","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The incidence of LCOS after surgery is high in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Therefore, determining the risk factors of LCOS has clinical significance for the management of CHD. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors of LCOS. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with CHD who underwent cardiac surgery at Shanghai Children\u2019s Medical Center between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017. Demographic characteristics and baseline data were extracted from the health data resource center of the hospital, which integrates clinical routine data including medical records, diagnoses, orders, surgeries, laboratory tests, imaging, nursing, and other subsystems.

Here, we analyzed summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association study of HIV-1 acquisition to-date, consisting of 6,334 infected patients and 7,247 population controls, to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms implicated in this trait. We found that HIV-1 acquisition is polygenic and heritable, with SNP heritability estimates explaining 28\u201342% of the variance in this trait at a population level. Genetic correlations alongside UK Biobank data revealed associations with smoking, prospective memory and socioeconomic traits. Gene-level enrichment analysis identified EF-hand calcium binding domain 14 as a novel susceptibility gene for HIV\u20131 acquisition. We also observed that susceptibility variants for HIV-1 acquisition were significantly enriched for genes expressed in T-cells, but also in striatal and hippocampal neurons. Finally, we tested how polygenic risk scores for HIV-1 acquisition influence blood levels of 35 inflammatory markers in 406 HIV-1-negative individuals. We found that higher genetic risk for HIV-1 acquisition was associated with lower levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 17. Our findings corroborate a complex model for HIV-1 acquisition, whereby susceptibility is partly heritable and moderated by specific behavioral, cellular and immunological parameters.","publish_time":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Powell, Timothy R.; Duarte, Rodrigo R.

However, the cause of dysphagia development by halo-vest fixation is not yet clear. We therefore investigated the incidence of dysphagia and cervical alignment as well as clinical data from medical charts in patients treated with a halo-vest brace. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from the medical charts of 49 patients who had undergone halo-vest fixation. Occipito (O)-C2 angle, C2-C6 angle, and pharyngeal inlet angle were assessed by lateral plain X-rays of the cervical spine. The impacts of these parameters on incidence and severity of dysphagia were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (32%) suffered from dysphagia during halo-vest fixation, and age and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay were greater in the dysphagia group (p = 0.044 and 0.013, respectively) than in those who did not develop dysphagia. O-C2 angle was smaller in the dysphagia group (p = 0.016). After multivariate logistic analysis, body mass index, ICU stay, and O-C2 angle remained as independent risk factors related to incidence of dysphagia. Spearman rank correlation showed a negative correlation between ICU stay and Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) (p = 0.026), and a positive correlation between O-C2 angle and FILS (p = 0.008).

In Europe, 29.9% of the isolates are oxacillin-resistant. The changing epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial infections and the decreasing susceptibility to first-line antibiotics leave clinicians with few therapeutic options. The objective of our study was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility, the associated molecular mechanisms of resistance and the epidemiological relatedness of MRSA strains isolated from the endotracheal tubes (ETT) of intubated critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: The antimicrobial susceptibility to vancomycin, linezolid, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid, gentamicin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, rifampicin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and tetracycline were measured. Resistance mechanisms were then analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was carried out by multi-locus sequence typing. RESULTS: S. aureus isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and fusidic acid. The most frequent mutations in quinolone-resistant S. aureus strains were S84L in the gyrA gene, V511A in the gyrB gene, S144P in the grlA gene, and K401R/E in the grlB gene. Strains resistant to erythromycin carried the ermC, ermA, and msrA genes; the same ermC and ermA genes were detected in strains resistant to clindamycin. The aac(6\u2032)-aph(2\u2033) gene was related to gentamicin resistance, while resistance to tetracycline was related to tetK (efflux pump). The fusB gene was detected in the strain resistant to fusidic acid. The most frequent sequence types were ST22, ST8, and ST217, which were distributed in four clonal complexes (CC5, CC22, CC45, and CC59). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of resistance to second-line antimicrobials threatens the treatment of nosocomial respiratory infections due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus with decreased susceptibility to linezolid and vancomycin. The wide genotypic diversity found reinforces the central role of ICU infection control in preventing nosocomial transmission.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cabrera, Roberto; Fern\u00E1ndez-Barat, Laia; Motos, Anna; L\u00F3pez-Aladid, Rub\u00E9n; V\u00E1zquez, Nil; Panigada, Mauro; \u00C1lvarez-Lerma, Francisco; L\u00F3pez, Yuly; Mu\u00F1oz, Laura; Castro, Pedro; Vila, Jordi; Torres, Antoni","journal":"Antimicrob Resist Infect Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0ec09d125dc50e058955452511024aa8dc98ea5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7049205.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7049205/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["Strains resistant","resistant Staphylococcus aureus","methicillin-resistant","aureus strains","quinolone-resistant","strain resistant","oxacillin-resistant","aureus isolates","gentamicin resistance","nosocomial infections","grlA gene","gyrB gene","gyrA gene","Resistance mechanisms","grlB gene","fusB gene","nosocomial transmission","erythromycin","antimicrobial susceptibility","tetracycline","clindamycin","fusidic acid","cases of nosocomial pneumonia","decreasing susceptibility","decreased susceptibility","associated molecular mechanisms of resistance","High levels of resistance","treatment of nosocomial respiratory infections","ciprofloxacin","epidemiological relatedness of MRSA strains","ermC","linezolid","vancomycin","ermA genes","Molecular epidemiology","changing epidemiology of methicillin","frequent sequence types","line antibiotics","line antimicrobials","msrA genes","frequent mutations","multi-locus sequence","central role of ICU infection control","intensive care unit","quinupristin-dalfopristin","V511A","chloramphenicol","S84L","CC22","ill patients","sulfamethoxazole","rifampicin","ST22","ST8","K401R","S144P","CC45","ETT","clinicians","polymerase chain reaction","trimethoprim","endotracheal tubes","tetK","wide genotypic diversity","clonal complexes","therapeutic options","sequencing","CONCLUSIONS","study","METHODS","RESULTS","efflux pump","prevalent pathogen","CC59","ST217","BACKGROUND","aac","objective","Europe"],"language":"en"},

Results indicated that the limit of detection (LOD) of the new ICA was 0.47 \u03BCg/mL (5.9 \u00D7 10(3) TCID(50)/mL) and the liner detection range of the ICA was 0.625\u201310 \u03BCg/mL (7.8 \u00D7 10(3)\u201310(5) TCID(50)/mL). The specificity analysis results showed that this new ICA had no cross reaction in the presence of other porcine viruses. The ICA was also validated for the detection of PEDV in swine stool samples with little interference from swine stool. To compare its accuracy to other traditional detection methods, 27 swine stool samples from south of China were investigated with the new developed ICA, commercial strip and RT-PCR. Results showed that the new ICA was more comparable to RT-PCR than commercial test strip. CONCLUSIONS: A new ICA based on mAbs prepared by CSFIA was developed in this study. It was a sensitive, specific and rapid method that could be used for on-site detection of PEDV and therefore was useful for the diagnosis and prevention of PED.

It is the etiological agent of several diseases, among which viral arthritis and malabsorption syndrome are the most commercially important, causing considerable economic losses in the poultry industry. Although a small but increasing number of reports have characterized some aspects of ARV infection, global changes in protein expression in ARV-infected host cells have not been examined. The current study used a proteomics approach to obtain a comprehensive view of changes in protein levels in host cells upon infection by ARV. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The proteomics profiles of DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells infected with ARV strain S1133 were analyzed by two-dimensional differential-image gel electrophoresis. The majority of protein expression changes (\u22651.5 fold, p\u003C0.05) occurred at 72 h post-infection. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry identified 51 proteins with differential expression levels, including 25 that were upregulated during ARV infection and 26 that were downregulated. These proteins were divided into eight groups according to biological function: signal transduction, stress response, RNA processing, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and cytoskeleton organization. They were further examined by immunoblotting to validate the observed alterations in protein expression. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report of a time-course proteomic analysis of ARV-infected host cells. Notably, all identified proteins involved in signal transduction, RNA processing, and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway were downregulated in infected cells, whereas proteins involved in DNA synthesis, apoptosis, and energy production pathways were upregulated. In addition, other differentially expressed proteins were linked with the cytoskeleton, metabolism, redox regulation, and stress response. These proteomics data provide valuable information about host cell responses to ARV infection and will facilitate further studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying ARV pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2014-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Wen-Ting; Wu, Yi-Le; Chen, Ting; Cheng, Chao-Sheng; Chan, Hong-Lin; Chou, Hsiu-Chuan; Chen, Yi-Wen; Yin, Hsien-Sheng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d2d787fd72d87b38275e4deb4b160ad8c80338c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3965424.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667214/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092154","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARV-infected host cells","ARV pathogenesis","aspects of ARV infection","infected cells","ARV strain S1133","identified proteins","energy metabolism","protein levels","majority of protein expression changes","time-course proteomic analysis of ARV","differential expression levels","lipid metabolism","carbohydrate metabolism","chicken fibroblast cells","h post-infection","global changes","host cell responses","signal transduction","RNA processing","ubiquitin-proteasome pathway","stress response","proteomics approach","proteomics data","comprehensive view of changes","proteomics profiles of DF","cytoskeleton organization","energy production pathways","laser desorption ionization time","two-dimensional differential-image gel electrophoresis","valuable information","apoptosis","flight mass spectrometry","biological function","considerable economic losses","DNA synthesis","redox regulation","studies","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","diseases","Orthoreovirus genus","viral arthritis","malabsorption syndrome","poultry industry","Matrix","member","molecular mechanisms","groups","fold","number of reports","Avian reovirus","Reoviridae family","current study","METHODOLOGY","BACKGROUND","observed alterations","SIGNIFICANCE","etiological agent","CONCLUSION","addition"],"language":"en"},

These compounds have demonstrated good activity in treating viral infections in laboratory animals caused by various RNA viruses, including influenza virus, arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Treatment has in some cases been effective when initiated up to 5\u20137 days after virus infection, when the animals already showed signs of illness. Studies on the mechanism of action of T-705 have shown that this compound is converted to the ribofuranosyltriphosphate derivative by host enzymes, and this metabolite selectively inhibits the influenza viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase without cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. Interestingly, these compounds do not inhibit host DNA and RNA synthesis and inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity. From in vivo studies using several animal models, the pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives were found to be effective in protecting animals from death, reducing viral burden, and limiting disease manifestations, even when treatment was initiated after virus inoculation. Importantly, T-705 imparts its beneficial antiviral effects without significant toxicity to the host. Prompt development of these compounds is expected to provide effective countermeasures against pandemic influenza virus and several bioweapon threats, all of which are of great global public health concern given the current paucity of highly effective broad-spectrum drugs.","publish_time":"2009-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Furuta, Yousuke; Takahashi, Kazumi; Shiraki, Kimiyasu; Sakamoto, Kenichi; Smee, Donald F.; Barnard, Dale L.; Gowen, Brian B.; Julander, Justin G.; Morrey, John D.","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b33cb49553eab1aa0f3b950c8482ba5fb4645c4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127082.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2009.02.198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19428599/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635420900240X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635420900240X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs0OTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus infection","virus inoculation","pandemic influenza virus","mouth disease virus","West Nile virus","yellow fever virus","compounds","influenza viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","RNA synthesis","effective countermeasures","series of pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives T","effective broad-spectrum drugs","various RNA viruses","viral infections","viral burden","laboratory animals","host DNA","host enzymes","Treatment","Studies","candidate antiviral drugs","good activity","disease manifestations","beneficial antiviral effects","current paucity","WNV","bunyaviruses","arenaviruses","inosine","cytotoxicity","great global public health concern","significant toxicity","foot","metabolite","monophosphate dehydrogenase","mammalian cells","ribofuranosyltriphosphate derivative","YFV","animal models","bioweapon threats","death","favipiravir","IMPDH","mechanism of action","FMDV","Prompt development","signs of illness","days","cases"],"language":"en"},

However, the cellular mechanisms that define the protection and/or immunopathogenesis of these immune cells during a ZIKV infection are still largely unknown.

These methods include a) a ZIKV infection and vaccine inoculation in Ifnar1(-/-) mice; b) histopathology, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry assays to detect the virus infection and inflammation in the brain, testes, and spleen; c) the preparation of a tetramer of ZIKV-derived T-cell epitopes; d) the detection of ZIKV-specific T cells in the monocytes isolated from the brain, testes, and spleen. Using these approaches, it is possible to detect the antigen-specific T cells that have infiltrated into the immunoprivileged organs and to evaluate the functions of these T cells during the infection: potential immune protection via virus clearance and/or immunopathogenesis to exacerbate the inflammation.

To determine how long HRV RNA can be detected after HRV infection. Methods: Middle ear effusion (MEE) samples collected at the time of tympanostomy tube placement from 100 children with OME were examined. Viral RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. For HRV the results were compared with virus isolation in cell culture. In vitro studies of the persistence of HRV infectivity and RNA were conducted by combining ~105 median cell culture infectious doses of HRV with pooled MEE at 37\u00B0C and assaying serial samples for 12 weeks. Results: Virus RNA was detected in 30 children. HRV was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 19 children with OME and by virus isolation in 5 children. RSV RNA was found in 8 and HCV in 3 children with OME. No dual viral infection was found. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 35 MEE samples and were associated with viral RNA in 11 cases, most often with HRV (9 cases). Under in vitro conditions, HRV culture positivity declined rapidly (\u003C2 days), but RNA was detectable for up to 8 weeks. Conclusions: These results suggest that virus infection, particularly HRV infection, either alone or concurrent with bacteria, is present in a larger percentage of children with OME than previously suspected. It remains to be determined how often the presence of viral RNA in MEE represents persistent RNA, ongoing viral replication, or recurrent infection.

For this purpose, the accuracy of the existing tests had to be improved and suitable means for removal of extraneous molecules had to be established. Six radioactive probes were used to obtain adequate detection signals. These probes, containing the complete N and E1 gene sequences and other sequences, hybridized to about 1 4 of the total length of the viral RNA. Genomic RNA could be detected after direct spotting of samples, but prior Freo-nextraction or centrifugation of specimens on a cushion of sucrose improved considerably the positive identification of virus containing samples. RNA detection in positive clinical specimens was significantly better by hybridization than immunological detection of BCV by ELISA, although differences were slight after two passages of the virus on HRT-18 cell monolayers. Consequently, the reliability of positive and negative test results in hybridization tests on Freon extracted specimens was better than in ELISA. However, results after extraction with other organic solvents were inferior. The accuracy of ELISA was surpassed by hybridization assays. Background signals, due to vector homology were found to be negligible in all the samples analyzed.","publish_time":"1990-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verbeek, Arnold; Dea, Serge; Tijssen, Peter","journal":"Molecular and Cellular Probes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27b3c3be81f120203b7227174efce65b712e0132.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089085089090012O; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/089085089090012O","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of virus","RNA detection","hybridization tests","positive clinical specimens","centrifugation of specimens","hybridization assays","accuracy of ELISA","positive identification of virus","immunological detection of BCV","adequate detection signals","reliability of positive","Abstract Molecular hybridization","viral RNA","Genomic RNA","direct spotting of samples","existing tests","Background signals","radioactive probes","negative test results","E1 gene sequences","Freon","prior Freo-nextraction","complete N","suitable means","removal of extraneous molecules","vector homology","organic solvents","HRT","passages","differences","cushion of sucrose","total length","cell monolayers","bovine coronavirus","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Recipients of the different types of transplantation are at high risk of infection. Nosocomial infections predominate in patients who have undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplantation during the early post-engraftment period (30-100 days after the infusion); the incidence of infection is higher in graft-versus-host disease. Nodular lesions can appear in the lungs due to invasive fungal infection. A diffuse pattern is usually secondary to viral infection or P. jirovecii pneumonia. After the first 100 days a moderate risk of infection by conventional and opportunistic infections persists, such as late CMV infection. Advances in surgical techniques and the use of calcineurinics have reduced mortality from infections in recipients of solid organ transplantations. Nosocomial infections are common during the first month; opportunistic infections that are dependent on cellular immunity are more common between the first and the sixth month, from the sixth month the risk lowers and community-based infections similar to those of immunocompetent patients predominate.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramos Mart\u00EDnez, A.; Pintos Pascual, I.; M\u00FA\u00F1ez Rubio, E.","journal":"Medicine - Programa de Formaci\u00F3n M\u00E9dica Continuada Acreditado","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f34431c7a6db1380acb11c1d9c2aeb5764436e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7143593.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304541218301045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304541218301045","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["En los trasplantados","Los avances en","opportunistic infections","Nosocomial infections","mortalidad por infecciones en trasplantados","infecci\u00F3n tard\u00EDa por CMV","infecciones nosocomiales","los primeros","viral infection","incidence of infection","infecci\u00F3n por microorganismos convencionales y oportunistas","high risk of infection","moderate risk of infection","infecci\u00F3n v\u00EDrica o","neumon\u00EDa por","los pacientes inmunocompetentes","late CMV infection","month","infecci\u00F3n es m\u00E1s elevada en pacientes","riesgo baja y predominan","infecciones oportunistas dependientes","los diferentes tipos","Resumen Los receptores","invasive fungal infection","primer y sexto mes son m\u00E1s frecuentes","primer mes","t\u00E9cnicas quir\u00FArgicas y","inmunidad celular y","infecciones comunitarias semejantes","community-based infections similar","moderado riesgo","riesgo elevado","Durante","days","pulm\u00F3n pueden aparecer lesiones nodulares por infecci\u00F3n f\u00FAngica invasora o bien","d\u00EDas persiste","trasplante presentan","d\u00EDas tras","Abstract Recipients","immunocompetent patients","jirovecii pneumonia","precursores hematopoy\u00E9ticos predominan","different types of transplantation","haematopoietic stem cell transplantation","recipients of solid organ transplantations","pat\u00F3n difuso habitualmente secundario","calcineur\u00EDnicos han reducido","como","empleo","entre","enfermedad","partir","incidencia","early post-engraftment period","\u00F3rgano s\u00F3lido","use of calcineurinics","lungs","mortality","injerto contra","cellular immunity","surgical techniques","periodo posprendimiento temprano","infusi\u00F3n","Despu\u00E9s","diffuse pattern","Advances","infusion","host disease","Nodular lesions"],"language":"en"},

SAR studies indicated that the N-substituted benzyl and C-5 substituted phenyl groups greatly enhance their cytotoxic activity, whereas an intact carbonyl functionality on C-3 present in the parent ring is required to maintain such a potency. Particularly, N-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(p-methoxyphenyl)isatin (compound 2m) showed the highest antitumor activity against K562 cell lines (IC50 = 0.03 \u03BCM). Moreover, treatment with compound 2m significantly inhibited liver cancer HepG2 cells proliferation and migration, which could also reduce the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) tube formation.

The seroprevalence to BRSV in Norwegian cattle herds is high, but its role in epidemics of respiratory disease is unclear. The aims of the study were to investigate the etiological role of BRSV and other respiratory viruses in epidemics of BRD and to perform phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian BRSV strains. RESULTS: BRSV infection was detected either serologically and/or virologically in 18 (86%) of 21 outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent. When serology indicated that bovine coronavirus and/or bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were present, the number of BRSV positive animals in the herd was always higher, supporting the view of BRSV as the main pathogen. Sequencing of the G gene of BRSV positive samples showed that the current circulating Norwegian BRSVs belong to genetic subgroup II, along with other North European isolates. One isolate from an outbreak in Norway in 1976 was also investigated. This strain formed a separate branch in subgroup II, clearly different from the current Scandinavian sequences. The currently circulating BRSV could be divided into two different strains that were present in the same geographical area at the same time. The sequence variations between the two strains were in an antigenic important part of the G protein. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that BRSV is the most important etiological agent of epidemics of BRD in Norway and that it often acts as the only viral agent. The phylogenetic analysis of the Norwegian strains of BRSV and several previously published isolates supported the theory of geographical and temporal clustering of BRSV.","publish_time":"2014-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klem, Thea B; Rimstad, Espen; Stokstad, Maria","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8806d2b5dd6c0709ed0fc8e99153cbef69fd4614.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3896707.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423030/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-15","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRSV"],"locations":["Norway"],"keyphrases":["Norwegian strains of BRSV","view of BRSV","BRSV infection","etiological role of BRSV","phylogenetic analysis of Norwegian BRSV strains","temporal clustering of BRSV","number of BRSV positive animals","G gene of BRSV positive samples","bovine respiratory disease","epidemics of respiratory disease","epidemics of BRD","different strains","Bovine respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory viruses","bovine coronavirus","important etiological agent of epidemics","bovine parainfluenza virus","current circulating Norwegian BRSVs","Norwegian cattle herds","single viral agent","Norway","RESULTS","theory of geographical","genetic subgroup","geographical area","G protein","published isolates","current Scandinavian sequences","North European isolates","cases","seroprevalence","BACKGROUND","major pathogens","complex","separate branch","study","main pathogen","Sequencing","time","sequence variations","serology","CONCLUSION","aims","outbreaks"],"language":"en"},

PURPOSE: This study\u2019s purpose is to study the use of information sources, knowledge, and health beliefs related to SARS and avian flu of Chinese people in the UK and The Netherlands, and to make comparisons with the general population in these countries. METHOD: Results of a self-administered questionnaire among 300 British/Dutch Chinese were compared to data obtained from a computer-assisted phone survey among the general population (n = 800). RESULTS: British/Dutch Chinese got most information about emerging diseases from family and friends, followed by Chinese media and British/Dutch TV. They had less confidence than general groups in their doctor, government agencies, and consumer/patient interest groups. Their knowledge of SARS was high. They had a lower perceived threat than general populations with regard to SARS and avian flu due to a lower perceived severity. They had higher self-efficacy beliefs regarding SARS and avian flu. CONCLUSION: In case of new outbreaks of SARS/avian flu in China, local authorities in the UK and The Netherlands can best reach Chinese people through informal networks and British/Dutch TV, while trying to improve confidence in information from the government. In communications, the severity of the disease rather than the susceptibility appears to need most attention.","publish_time":"2009-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Voeten, Helene A. C.

Environmental management strategies that reduce/eliminate vector breeding sites combined with improved personal prevention strategies can help to significantly reduce transmission of these infections. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) of residents in Western Jamaica regarding control of mosquito vectors and protection from mosquito bites. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and August 2010 among patients or family members of patients waiting to be seen at hospitals in Western Jamaica. Participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire on sociodemographic factors and KAPs regarding vector-borne diseases. KAP scores were calculated and categorized as high or low based on number of correct/positive responses. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of KAP and linear regression analysis conducted to determine if knowledge and attitude scores predicted practice scores. RESULTS: Three-hundred and sixty-one people (85 males and 276 females) participated in the study. Most participants (87%) scored low on knowledge and practice items (78%). Conversely, 78% scored high on attitudes items. By multivariate logistic regression, housewives were 82% less likely to have high attitude scores than laborers, and homeowners were 65% less likely to have high attitude scores than renters. Participants from households with 1\u20132 children were 3.4 times more likely to have high attitude scores compared to those from households with no children. Participants from households \u22655 people were 65% less likely to have high practice scores compared to those from households with \u003C5. By multivariable linear regression knowledge and attitude scores were significant predictors of practice score. CONCLUSION: The study revealed poor knowledge of vector-borne diseases and poor prevention practices among participants. It identified specific groups that can be targeted with vector-control and personal protection interventions to decrease transmission of the infections.","publish_time":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alobuia, Wilson M; Missikpode, Celestin; Aung, Maung; Jolly, Pauline E","journal":"Annals of Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f220e988761ecd5804df9ac2c569a75e717af74.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3d2827ff7a426234e8d1f942a7f927a6d74aade3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4818946.xml.json","url":"http://www.annalsofglobalhealth.org/articles/10.1016/j.aogh.2015.08.013/galley/1476/download/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214999615012291; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214999615012291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27036722/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aogh.2015.08.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KAP"],"locations":["Western Jamaica"],"keyphrases":["high attitude scores","high practice scores","KAP scores","Participants","poor knowledge of vector","households","vector-control","Outbreaks of vector","multivariable linear regression knowledge","diseases","practice items","cross-sectional study","vector breeding sites","poor prevention practices","linear regression analysis","multivariate logistic regression","Logistic regression analyses","KAPs","significant predictors of practice score","predictors of KAP","Western Jamaica","transmission","people","attitudes items","children","infections","improved personal prevention strategies","control of mosquito vectors","personal protection interventions","resource-poor countries","mosquito bites","Environmental management strategies","family members of patients","sociodemographic factors","interviewer-administered questionnaire","health systems","number of correct","malaria","residents","dengue","housewives","homeowners","laborers","times","positive responses","females","hospitals","CONCLUSION","renters","METHODS","BACKGROUND","specific groups","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R(0) of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of R(t). In the first assumption, R(t) was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with R(t) = 1.9, 2.6, or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258, and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, R(t) was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (R(t) = 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9) to below 1 (R(t) = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public health intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077\u201384,520 or 55,869\u201381,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce R(t) to an ideal level and control the infection.","publish_time":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Huwen; Wang, Zezhou; Dong, Yinqiao; Chang, Ruijie; Xu, Chen; Yu, Xiaoyue; Zhang, Shuxian; Tsamlag, Lhakpa; Shang, Meili; Huang, Jinyan; Wang, Ying; Xu, Gang; Shen, Tian; Zhang, Xinxin; Cai, Yong","journal":"Cell Discov","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7039910.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41421-020-0148-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32133152/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["estimated R","China","assumptions of R","control measures","strict measures","Wuhan","estimated number of infections","current measures","high number of COVID","peak","necessary strict public health measures","implementation of strict prevention","Coronavirus Disease","outbreak of clusters","high level of transmission","public health intervention","novel coronavirus","ideal level","infectious disease dynamics SEIR","different phases","various levels of prevention","viral pneumonia","cases","nCoV","early phase","dates","sufficiency","new estimation","order","locations","valuable prediction","epidemic trend","SARS-CoV","Hubei Province","effect","groups","important index","model","indication","occurrence"],"language":"en"},

Of the 31 strains, 24 were H120-like and two were M41-like isolates as determined by complete genomic sequence analysis, indicating that most of the IBV isolates were likely the reisolated vaccine virus. The remaining five IBV isolates, ck/CH/LHB/111172, ck/CH/LSD/111219, ck/CH/LHB/130598, ck/CH/LDL/110931, and ck/CH/LHB/130573, were shown to have originated from natural recombination events between an H120-like vaccine strain and other types of viruses. The virus cross-neutralization test found that the antigenicity of ck/CH/LHB/111172, ck/CH/LSD/111219, and ck/CH/LHB/130598 was similar to that of H120. Vaccination with the H120 vaccine offered complete protection against challenge with these isolates. However, isolates ck/CH/LDL/110931 and ck/CH/LHB/130573 were serotypically different from their parental viruses and from other serotypes in this study. Furthermore, vaccination with the H120 vaccine did not provide protection against challenge with these two isolates. The results of this study demonstrated that recombination is the mechanism that is responsible for the emergence of new serotype strains, and it has the ability to alter virus serotypes. Therefore, IBV surveillance of chicken flocks vaccinated with IBV live vaccines, as well as the consideration of new strategies to effectively control IBV infection using inactivated or/and genetically engineered vaccines, is of great importance.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Lingfeng; Zhang, Tingting; Han, Zongxi; Liang, Shuling; Xu, Yang; Xu, Qianqian; Chen, Yuqiu; Zhao, Yan; Shao, Yuhao; Li, Huixin; Wang, Kexiong; Kong, Xiangang; Liu, Shengwang","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b4970858a35a4a456f2a0764c7e8fbd87e6c8ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117242.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515300432; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515300432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26482289/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.10.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3NTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Massachusetts"],"keyphrases":["isolates ck","IBV isolates","LHB","antigenicity of ck","H120 vaccine","IBV infection","IBV live vaccines","isolated Massachusetts genotype IBV strains","study","IBV surveillance of chicken flocks","reisolated vaccine virus","vaccine strain","virus serotypes","complete protection","challenge","LDL","LSD","Vaccination","emergence of new serotype strains","engineered vaccines","parental viruses","virus cross-neutralization test","types of viruses","consideration of new strategies","natural recombination events","complete genomic sequence analysis","mechanism","great importance","IBVs","samples","ability","Abstract","results","M41"],"language":"en"},

We want to investigate mechanism of niclosamide inducing cell apoptosis in HCC. METHODS: Two hepatoma cell lines were used to evaluate activity of niclosamide inducing cell apoptosis and study its mechanism. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting were used in analysis of genes expression or protein active regulated by niclosamide. RESULTS: Niclosamide remarkably induced cell apoptosis in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, our study revealed that RNA-dependent protein kinase-like kinase (PERK) is activated and its expression is up-regulated in HCC cells which are exposed to niclosamide. niclosamide also significantly increase activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP) expression in HCC cells. It\u2019s suggested that the function of niclosamide was abrogated by PERK inhibitor or absent ATF3. Expression of PERK and CHOP is correlated with ATF3 level in the cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicate that ATF3 plays an integral role in ER stress activated and cell apoptosis induced by niclosamide in HCC cells. In this study, the new mechanism of niclosamide as anti-cancer we investigated, too.","publish_time":"2016-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Weng, Shunyan; Zhou, Liang; Deng, Qing; Wang, Jiaxian; Yu, Yan; Zhu, Jianwei; Yuan, Yunsheng","journal":"BMC Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94827ed2231500b8b66fde9844d2aebe81a4aba9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4766699.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12876-016-0442-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26917416/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCC"],"locations":["eastern Asia"],"keyphrases":["activity of niclosamide","function of niclosamide","HCC cells","new mechanism of niclosamide","induced cell apoptosis","Expression of PERK","hepatoma cells","study","hepatoma cell lines","absent ATF3","ATF3 level","protein active regulated","enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein","RNA-dependent protein kinase","CHOP","analysis of genes expression","PERK inhibitor","RESULTS","activating transcription factor","western blotting","ER stress","world","CCAAT","integral role","mortality","aggressive human malignancies","Quantitative real-time PCR","ATF4","anti-cancer","eastern Asia","BACKGROUND","Hepatocellular carcinoma","METHODS","phase","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

We have developed an automated Cluster Picker which identifies monophyletic clades meeting user-input criteria for bootstrap support and maximum genetic distance within large phylogenetic trees. A second tool, the Cluster Matcher, automates the process of linking genetic data to epidemiological or clinical data, and matches clusters between runs of the Cluster Picker. RESULTS: We explore the effect of different bootstrap and genetic distance thresholds on clusters identified in a data set of publicly available HIV sequences, and compare these results to those of a previously published tool for cluster identification. To demonstrate their utility, we then use the Cluster Picker and Cluster Matcher together to investigate how clusters in the data set changed over time. We find that clusters containing sequences from more than one UK location at the first time point (multiple origin) were significantly more likely to grow than those representing only a single location. CONCLUSIONS: The Cluster Picker and Cluster Matcher can rapidly process phylogenetic trees containing tens of thousands of sequences. Together these tools will facilitate comparisons of pathogen transmission dynamics between studies and countries.","publish_time":"2013-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ragonnet-Cronin, Manon; Hodcroft, Emma; Hu\u00E9, St\u00E9phane; Fearnhill, Esther; Delpech, Valerie; Brown, Andrew J Leigh; Lycett, Samantha","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62a1f5bb2940b4c4c29338c8f9fc47fd431aed28.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7f8fc0ff30e4455d834e829db27b8d529b2920df.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4228337.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24191891/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs3Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cluster Matcher","automated Cluster Picker","cluster analysis","cluster identification","genetic data","clusters","clinical data","sequence data sets","maximum genetic distance","genetic distance thresholds","automated tools","process","RESULTS","large phylogenetic trees","available HIV sequences","bootstrap support","investigation of pathogen transmission patterns","comparisons of pathogen transmission dynamics","time point","UK location","published tool","single location","effect of different bootstrap","monophyletic clades meeting user-input criteria","size","standardized methods","studies","multiple origin","countries","tens of thousands","runs","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","utility"],"language":"en"},

Given the genetic diversity of respiratory viruses and the emergence of drug resistant strains, the targeted disruption of human host-virus interactions is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating multi-viral infections. The availability of large-scale genomic datasets focused on host-pathogen interactions can be used to discover novel drug targets as well as potential opportunities for drug repositioning. METHODS/RESULTS: In this study, we performed a large-scale analysis of microarray datasets involving host response to infections by influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, SARS-coronavirus, metapneumonia virus, coxsackievirus and cytomegalovirus. Common genes and pathways were found through a rigorous, iterative analysis pipeline where relevant host mRNA expression datasets were identified, analyzed for quality and gene differential expression, then mapped to pathways for enrichment analysis. Possible repurposed drugs targets were found through database and literature searches. A total of 67 common biological pathways were identified among the seven different respiratory viruses analyzed, representing fifteen laboratories, nine different cell types, and seven different array platforms. A large overlap in the general immune response was observed among the top twenty of these 67 pathways, adding validation to our analysis strategy. Of the top five pathways, we found 53 differentially expressed genes affected by at least five of the seven viruses. We suggest five new therapeutic indications for existing small molecules or biological agents targeting proteins encoded by the genes F3, IL1B, TNF, CASP1 and MMP9. Pathway enrichment analysis also identified a potential novel host response, the Parkin-Ubiquitin Proteasomal System (Parkin-UPS) pathway, which is known to be involved in the progression of neurodegenerative Parkinson\u0027s disease. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that multiple and diverse respiratory viruses invoke several common host response pathways. Further analysis of these pathways suggests potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","publish_time":"2012-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Steven B.; Dampier, William; Tozeren, Aydin; Brown, James R.; Magid-Slav, Michal","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ac423d77382c035d9ba1f51ed94d524d1a9ec7f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3303816.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0033174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22432004/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4NzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["common host response pathways","different respiratory viruses","potential novel host response","analysis strategy","common biological pathways","seasonal respiratory viruses","diverse respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial virus","Pathway enrichment analysis","host-pathogen interactions","potential opportunities","potential therapeutic strategy","genetic diversity of respiratory viruses","large-scale analysis of microarray datasets","Common genes","iterative analysis pipeline","relevant host mRNA expression datasets","metapneumonia virus","targeted disruption of human host-virus interactions","novel drug targets","general immune response","therapeutic intervention","drug repositioning","study","genes F3","availability of large-scale genomic datasets","new therapeutic indications","different cell types","different array platforms","Parkin-UPS","emergence of drug resistant strains","biological agents","multi-viral infections","gene differential expression","Parkin-Ubiquitin Proteasomal System","Possible repurposed drugs targets","existing small molecules","rhinovirus","influenza","SARS-coronavirus","proteins","major global health concern","database","IL1B","TNF","laboratories","CASP1","large overlap","coxsackievirus","quality","BACKGROUND","Pandemic","progression of neurodegenerative Parkinson\u0027s disease","MMP9","cytomegalovirus","total","validation","literature searches","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Results: Amylmetacresol/DCBA throat lozenges reduced throat soreness at 5 min after first dose, which persisted for 2 h and was significantly different vs. non\u2010medicated lozenges at all assessment timepoints for the duration of the 3\u2010day study. Similar significant effects were observed with sore throat relief, easing of difficulty with swallowing and functional impairment scores. There were no differences in adverse events reported between treatment groups. Conclusion: Amylmetacresol/DCBA throat lozenges provide rapid analgesic effects that last for 2 h, providing ongoing relief long after the lozenge has dissolved. The superior analgesic effects and improvements in functional impairment scores observed with AMC/DCBA throat lozenges translate into pain relief benefits that are clinically meaningful and are thus a suitable OTC treatment option for patients in the self\u2010management of acute sore throat.","publish_time":"2009-10-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"McNally, D.; Simpson, M.; Morris, C.; Shephard, A.; Goulder, M.","journal":"Int J Clin Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ee19e4e141da288493b92783b5841972c339a43.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202229.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19849767/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2009.02230.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMC/DCBA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DCBA throat lozenges","relief of acute sore throat","treatment of acute sore throat","sore throat relief ratings","severity of throat soreness","Subsequent lozenges","self\u2010management of acute sore throat","non\u2010medicated lozenges","non\u2010medicated placebo lozenges","functional impairment scores","AMC","Patients","ongoing relief","analgesic properties of amylmetacresol","dose","rapid analgesic effects","superior analgesic effects","treatment alternatives","treatment groups","pain relief benefits","Difficulty","suitable OTC treatment option","swallowing","rating assessments","baseline assessments","day study","Similar significant effects","assessment timepoints","end of Days","improvements","upper respiratory tract infections","availability","dichlorobenzyl alcohol","adverse events","duration","Results","Conclusion","differences","Strepsils","Methods","antibiotics"],"language":"en"},

Thus the drug has markedly altered the subcellular distribution of the glycoproteins so that they accumulate in the internal smooth membranes but are virtually absent in the plasma membrane. These glycoproteins that accumulated in intracellular membranes have a cytoplasmic domain susceptible to protease digestion and thus are transmembranous. Under such conditions, the behavior of M protein, which plays a crucial role in virus assembly (Y. Nagai et al., 1976, Virology 69, 523\u2013538), has been analyzed. It has been found that the M protein can neither associate with the internal membranes nor bind to the plasma membrane. Thus no virus budding has been observed, either at the plasma membranes or at internal membranes. These results substantiate the view that the interaction between M and glycoproteins is of great importance for virus assembly and suggest further that this interaction is possible only when the glycoproteins have been incorporated into the plasma membrane.","publish_time":"1986-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tetsuya, Yoshida; Yasuhiro, Nakayama; Hiroshi, Nagura; Tetsuya, Toyoda; Kazuo, Nishikawa; Michinari, Hamaguchi; Yoshiyuki, Nagai","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8dd204026a2ba374b1773b4074ae812c48134d4f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170286900407; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170286900407","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Monensin"],"organizations":["Newcastle"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasma membranes","internal membranes","intracellular membranes","virus assembly","internal smooth membranes","glycoproteins of Newcastle disease virus","virus budding","interaction","intracellular transport","fatty acid acylation","trans Golgi stacks of infected BHK cells","cytoplasmic domain susceptible","post-translational modifications","protease digestion","glycosylation","proteolytic cleavage","crucial role","effect","Nagai","great importance","Abstract Monensin","subcellular distribution","associate","drug","conditions","behavior","results","view","Virology"],"language":"en"},

Through different inoculation routes, MHV-A59 can provide animal models for encephalitis, hepatitis and pneumonia to explore viral life machinery and virus-host interactions. In viral replication, non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5), also termed main protease (Mpro), plays a dominant role in processing coronavirus-encoded polyproteins and is thus recognized as an ideal target of anti-coronavirus agents. However, no structure of the MHV-A59 Mpro has been reported, and molecular exploration of the catalysis mechanism remains hindered. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the MHV-A59 Mpro complexed with a Michael acceptor-based inhibitor, N3. Structural analysis revealed that the C\u03B2 of the vinyl group of N3 covalently bound to C145 of the catalytic dyad of Mpro, which irreversibly inactivated cysteine protease activity. The lactam ring of the P1 side chain and the isobutyl group of the P2 side chain, which mimic the conserved residues at the same positions of the substrate, fit well into the S1 and S2 pockets. Through a comparative study with Mpro of other coronaviruses, we observed that the substrate-recognition pocket and enzyme inhibitory mechanism is highly conservative. Altogether, our study provided structural features of MHV-A59 Mpro and indicated that a Michael acceptor inhibitor is an ideal scaffold for antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2019-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Wen; Cui, Shanshan; Chen, Cheng; Chen, Xia; Wang, Zefang; Yang, Haitao; Zhang, Lei","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e19dcc43686493e4e329e94f8da9518eb5d77e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185540.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X19303067; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X19303067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30833083/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.02.105","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Michael"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MHV-A59 Mpro","structural features of MHV","catalytic dyad of Mpro","Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus A59","Michael acceptor inhibitor","chain","Michael acceptor-based inhibitor","vinyl group of N3","ideal scaffold","isobutyl group","catalysis mechanism","viral replication","main protease","crystal structure","comparative study","Structural analysis","ideal target of anti-coronavirus agents","viral life machinery","enzyme inhibitory mechanism","virus-host interactions","substrate-recognition pocket","processing coronavirus-encoded polyproteins","inactivated cysteine protease activity","pneumonia","dominant role","animal models","liver","genus betacoronavirus","Nsp5","P1","C\u03B2","encephalitis","C145","representative member","subfamily Coronavirinae","non-structural protein","molecular exploration","coronaviruses","different inoculation routes","antiviral drugs","brain","respiratory tract","S1","positions","conserved residues","lactam ring","P2","S2 pockets"],"language":"en"},

Abstract Rabies is one of the so-called lost diseases in Germany despite every year more than 55.000 cases occur worldwide and more than 10 million post-exposition immunisations are being accomplished. The disease is caused by a virus. After a bite by a bat or, more often, a fox in Central Europe, or a dog in Africa, Asia or South America or any other animal the virus is being incorporated in muscle cells, multiplies and after a while gets access to nerve cells. The virus attaches e.g. to acetylcholine receptors, is transported via the axon to the brain where it reproduces intracellularly. Infected nerve cells change their function. Incubation period up to the appearance of any signs and symptoms is approximately 2 weeks to months. Signs and symptoms are encephalitis or paralysis followed by hypersalivation, hydrophobia, coma and death. In people who have no vaccine protection and do not receive post-exposure vaccination the disease is lethal throughout. There is no antiviral therapy available. Rabies can be prevented by pre-emptive immunisation or after injuries of the lower limb by post-exposure prophylaxis. Natural hosts are small rodents, bats, and carnivores; in this respect rabies is a zoonotic disease and the virus can not be extinguished.","publish_time":"2010-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guertler, Lutz G.","journal":"DoctorConsult - The Journal.

Indicators of nonspecific and specific immunity were evaluated. Cows were vaccinated against rotavirus at 4 and 2 wk before expected parturition. Blood samples were obtained from cows before vaccination and at weekly intervals until calving and from calves at birth and 24h for analysis of serum protein concentrations, packed cell volume, white blood cell counts, white blood cell differentials, and serum rotavirus neutralization titers. Colostrum quantity and quality were measured at calving, and immunoglobulin isotype concentrations in colostrum were determined. Specific immunity was enhanced by MOS supplementation as evidenced by greater serum rotavirus neutralization titers at calving in cows supplemented with MOS compared with control cows. Colostral rotavirus neutralization titers were not affected by treatment. Although numerical differences appeared large, there was a high degree of variability in the colostral rotavirus neutralization titers. Calves from cows fed MOS tended to have greater serum rotavirus neutralization titers compared with calves from cows fed the control diet. There was a tendency for greater increases in serum protein concentrations from birth to 24h in calves from cows fed MOS compared with calves from cows fed the control diet. Results indicate that supplementation of MOS to cows during the dry period enhanced their immune response to rotavirus and tended to enhance the subsequent transfer of rotavirus antibodies to calves.","publish_time":"2005-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Franklin, S.

The hallmark feature of L. intracellularis infection is the proliferation of epithelial cells in intestinal crypts. A major limitation to the study of L. intracellularis infection is the lack of an in vitro model that reproduces the changes observed in proliferative enteropathy. Here we investigated the suitability of mouse enteroids as a model to study L. intracellularis infection. Mouse enteroids were microinjected with L. intracellularis, filter-sterilized L. intracellularis culture supernatant, or sterile cell culture media (DMEM). L. intracellularis antigen was detected in mouse enteroids by immunohistochemistry and was located mostly in the basal region of the epithelium. There was no differential growth of enteroids among treatment groups, and cellular proliferation was not increased in L. intracellularis-infected enteroids in relation to non-infected enteroids based on immunofluorescence staining. L. intracellularis infection did not induce changes in gene expression of Ki-67 (proliferation marker), Sox9 (marker for transit amplifying cells) and Muc2 (marker for goblet cells). These results indicate that although L. intracellularis antigen is detectable in mouse enteroids, indicating susceptibility to infection, mouse enteroids fail to replicate the cellular proliferation and gene expression changes observed in proliferative enteropathy. Nevertheless, we have successfully demonstrated that mouse enteroids can be used to model days-long intracellular pathogen infection, serving as potential models for the study of other pathogens of interest in veterinary medicine.","publish_time":"2019-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Resende, Talita Pilar; Medida, Ramya Lekha; Guo, Yue; Vannucci, Fabio A.; Saqui-Salces, Milena; Gebhart, Connie","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ae165f6805cbb0b5c688d4d5e5a89b6b7c16fae0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6642515.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31324204/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-019-0672-9","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intracellularis infection","intracellularis-infected enteroids","intracellularis antigen","Lawsonia intracellularis","suitability of mouse enteroids","intracellularis culture supernatant","non-infected enteroids","differential growth of enteroids","proliferation marker","intracellular pathogen infection","cellular proliferation","study of","proliferation of epithelial cells","gene expression changes","goblet cells","proliferative enteropathy","gene expression of Ki","important enteric pathogen","obligate intracellular bacterium","sterile cell culture media","pig herds","treatment groups","relation","susceptibility","Muc2","potential models","Sox9","filter-sterilized","horse farms","DMEM","pathogens","transit","intestinal crypts","immunofluorescence staining","days","hallmark feature of","lack","major limitation","basal region","epithelium","veterinary medicine","results","immunohistochemistry"],"language":"en"},

No HCV vaccine is currently available and treatment with antiviral therapy is associated with adverse side effects. Moreover, there is no preventive therapy for recurrent hepatitis C post liver transplantation. The NS3 serine protease is necessary for HCV replication and represents a prime target for developing anti HCV therapies. Recently we described a therapeutic approach for eradication of HCV infected cells that is based on protein delivery of two NS3 protease-activatable recombinant toxins we named \u201Czymoxins\u201D. These toxins were inactivated by fusion to rationally designed inhibitory peptides via NS3-cleavable linkers. Once delivered to cells where NS3 protease is present, the inhibitory peptide is removed resulting in re-activation of cytotoxic activity. The zymoxins we described suffered from two limitations: they required high levels of protease for activation and had basal activities in the un-activated form that resulted in a narrow potential therapeutic window. Here, we present a solution that overcame the major limitations of the \u201Cfirst generation zymoxins\u201D by converting MazF ribonuclease, the toxic component of the E. coli chromosomal MazEF toxin-antitoxin system, into an NS3-activated zymoxin that is introduced to cells by means of gene delivery. We constructed an expression cassette that encodes for a single polypeptide that incorporates both the toxin and a fragment of its potent natural antidote, MazE, linked via an NS3-cleavable linker. While covalently paired to its inhibitor, the ribonuclease is well tolerated when expressed in na\u00EFve, healthy cells. In contrast, activating proteolysis that is induced by even low levels of NS3, results in an eradication of NS3 expressing model cells and HCV infected cells. Zymoxins may thus become a valuable tool in eradicating cells infected by intracellular pathogens that express intracellular proteases.","publish_time":"2012-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shapira, Assaf; Shapira, Shiran; Gal-Tanamy, Meital; Zemel, Romy; Tur-Kaspa, Ran; Benhar, Itai","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e725656b0cdd0f7e78279187e0c251cf8683f1e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3281143.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0032320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22359682/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","Zymoxins"],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["eradication of NS3","eradication of HCV infected cells","NS3 serine protease","model cells","eradicating cells","healthy cells","NS3-activated zymoxin","low levels of NS3","NS3-cleavable linkers","HCV replication","HCV vaccine","NS3 protease-activatable recombinant toxins","anti HCV therapies","generation zymoxins","high levels of protease","major limitations","Hepatitis C virus","recurrent hepatitis C post liver transplantation","preventive therapy","antiviral therapy","inhibitory peptides","intracellular pathogens","intracellular proteases","therapeutic approach","protein delivery","MazF ribonuclease","gene delivery","major cause of chronic liver disease","un-activated form","re-activation of cytotoxic activity","narrow potential therapeutic window","infection","basal activities","prime target","coli chromosomal MazEF toxin-antitoxin system","toxic component","treatment","results","potent natural antidote","valuable tool","fragment","single polypeptide","global health threat","fusion","expression cassette","proteolysis","effects","solution","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The performance of the RVP Fast assay was assessed in the analysis of 373 nasopharyngeal samples. For the viruses of the DFA panel, detection rates of 27.6% and 23.8% were obtained by RVP and DFA, respectively, in analysis of a set of 297 samples collected in 2009\u20132010. These results show statistically significant superiority of the RVP Fast assay (P = 0.049). For RSV, hMPV, EV, and RV, detection rates of 48.0% and 45.2% were achieved by RVP and RT-PCR, respectively. For individual targets, increased detection of EV/RV (P = 0.043) and decreased detection of influenza A virus (P = 0.004) by RVP in comparison to real-time RT-PCR was observed.

The simulation results demonstrate that the maximal applications of quarantining and isolation strategies in the early stage of the epidemic are of very critical impacts in both cases of optimal and sub-optimal control. Otherwise, the control effect will be much worse. This gives a theoretical interpretation to the practical experiences that the early quarantine and isolation strategies are critically important to control the outbreaks of epidemics.

SARS-CoV-2 shares homology with other human coronaviruses that have also had nervous system involvement. Objective To review the neurological aspects of SARS-cov2 and other coronavirus, including transmission pathways, mechanisms of invasion into the nervous system, and mechanisms of neurological disease. Methods We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE data bases. Reviewed evidence is presented in sections of this manuscript which includes pathogenesis, neuro-invasion, encephalitis, Guillain-Barr\u00E9, ADEM, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease. Results A total 67 studies were included in the final analysis of experimental studies, case reports, series of cases, cohort studies, and systematic reviews related to neurological manifestations of SARS- CoV-2 and other human coronavirus infections. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor is expressed in the nervous system. Common reported symptoms included hyposmia, headaches, weakness, altered consciousness. Encephalitis, demyelination, neuropathy, and stroke have been associated with COVID-19. Infection through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb and dissemination through trans-synaptic transfer are some of the mechanisms proposed. Invasion of the medullary cardiorespiratory center by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill COVID-19 patients. Conclusion An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent experimental models with neuro-invasion as a reasonable concern that SARS-CoV-2 is a new neuropathogen. How it may cause acute and chronic neurologic disorders needs to be clarified in future research.","publish_time":"2020-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Montalvan, V.; Lee, J.; Bueso, T.; De Toledo, J.; Rivas, K.","journal":"Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/49fc80df61bf635018edcaf04e4c2d4130334795.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422545/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030384672030264X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clineuro.2020.105921; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030384672030264X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMBASE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","neurological manifestations of SARS","neurological aspects of SARS","neurological disorders","mechanisms of invasion","mechanisms of neurological disease","research reports neurological manifestations of COVID","neuro-invasion","patients","ill COVID","nervous system involvement","case reports","cohort studies","increasing number of reports","encephalitis","final analysis of experimental studies","systematic review of articles","human coronavirus infections","systematic reviews","human coronaviruses","cerebrovascular disease","future research","emergent experimental models","chronic neurologic disorders","headaches","olfactory bulb","dissemination","PubMed","series of cases","hyposmia","multiple sclerosis","SCOPUS","ADEM","Guillain-Barr\u00E9","trans-synaptic transfer","weakness","cribriform plate","polyneuropathy","pathogenesis","shares homology","cov2","Abstract Background","medullary cardiorespiratory center","reasonable concern","Common reported symptoms","EMBASE data bases","transmission pathways","sections","receptor","altered consciousness","refractory respiratory failure","demyelination","manuscript","stroke","Conclusion","Reviewed evidence","Methods","new neuropathogen","Objective"],"language":"en"},

However, much is not understood about the behavior of these aerosols and the risks they pose. We used a coughing patient simulator and a breathing worker simulator to investigate the exposure of health care workers to cough aerosol droplets, and to examine the efficacy of face shields in reducing this exposure. Our results showed that 0.9% of the initial burst of aerosol from a cough can be inhaled by a worker 46 cm (18 inches) from the patient. During testing of an influenza-laden cough aerosol with a volume median diameter (VMD) of 8.5 \u03BCm, wearing a face shield reduced the inhalational exposure of the worker by 96% in the period immediately after a cough. The face shield also reduced the surface contamination of a respirator by 97%. When a smaller cough aerosol was used (VMD = 3.4 \u03BCm), the face shield was less effective, blocking only 68% of the cough and 76% of the surface contamination. In the period from 1 to 30 minutes after a cough, during which the aerosol had dispersed throughout the room and larger particles had settled, the face shield reduced aerosol inhalation by only 23%. Increasing the distance between the patient and worker to 183 cm (72 inches) reduced the exposure to influenza that occurred immediately after a cough by 92%. Our results show that health care workers can inhale infectious airborne particles while treating a coughing patient. Face shields can substantially reduce the short-term exposure of health care workers to large infectious aerosol particles, but smaller particles can remain airborne longer and flow around the face shield more easily to be inhaled. Thus, face shields provide a useful adjunct to respiratory protection for workers caring for patients with respiratory infections. However, they cannot be used as a substitute for respiratory protection when it is needed.","publish_time":"2014-01-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindsley, William G.; Noti, John D.; Blachere, Francoise M.; Szalajda, Jonathan V.; Beezhold, Donald H.","journal":"Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76c14f5ca77aae8b5c08de6a8910daee6be9e336.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1027702151e441039ec492e11d4fd20eb7da65dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4734356.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467190/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4734356?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2013.877591","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["smaller cough aerosol","influenza-laden cough aerosol","large infectious aerosol particles","short-term exposure of health care workers","aerosol droplets","aerosol inhalation","efficacy of face shields","infectious airborne particles","smaller particles","routine care","larger particles","inhalational exposure","initial burst of aerosol","coughing patient simulator","respiratory protection","breathing worker simulator","VMD","respiratory infections","patients","\u03BCm","surface contamination","inches","period","results","volume median diameter","useful adjunct","flow","testing","room","behavior","aerosols","risks","substitute","minutes","distance"],"language":"en"},

In this study we prepare VLP containing full-length hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) from influenza and characterize their interactions with small molecule inhibitors. Using HA-VLP, we first show that VLP samples prepared using the standard sucrose gradient purification scheme contain significant amounts of serum proteins, which exhibit high potential for non-specific interactions, thereby complicating NMR studies of ligand-target interactions. We then show that the serum contaminants may be largely removed with the addition of a gel filtration chromatography step. Next, using HA-VLP we demonstrate that WaterLOGSY NMR is significantly more sensitive than Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR for the study of ligand interactions with membrane bound targets. In addition, we compare the ligand orientation to HA embedded in VLP with that of recombinant HA by STD NMR. In a subsequent step, using NA-VLP we characterize the kinetic and binding properties of substrate analogs and inhibitors of NA, including study of the H274Y-NA mutant, which leads to wide spread resistance to current influenza antivirals. In summary, our work suggests that VLP have high potential to become standard tools in biochemical and biophysical studies of viral membrane proteins, particularly when VLP are highly purified and combined with control VLP containing native membrane proteins.","publish_time":"2016-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Antanasijevic, Aleksandar; Kingsley, Carolyn; Basu, Arnab; Bowlin, Terry L.; Rong, Lijun; Caffrey, Michael","journal":"J Biomol NMR","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73d8d7c5e824498b75b078470e802d63a81b5600.json; document_parses/pdf_json/73a2152563e1818fe85fa8121710d75c3c9c24a0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4826305.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10858-016-0025-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26921030/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VLP","NMR","Saturation Transfer Difference","HA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HA-VLP","NA-VLP","control VLP","VLP constructs","VLP samples","native membrane proteins","membrane proteins of viruses","study of ligand interactions","biophysical studies of viral membrane proteins","biophysical properties of viral membrane proteins","cellular proteins","native membrane components","NMR studies of ligand","membrane bound targets","STD NMR","inhibitors of NA","recombinant HA","significant amounts of serum proteins","WaterLOGSY NMR","non-specific interactions","target interactions","high potential","native environment","ligand orientation","H274Y-NA mutant","addition","standard tools","attractive targets","subsequent step","serum contaminants","virus life cycle","current influenza antivirals","small molecule inhibitors","binding properties of substrate analogs","gel filtration chromatography step","standard sucrose gradient purification scheme","critical roles","cholesterol","wide spread resistance","lipids","Saturation Transfer Difference","carbohydrates","entire protein sequence","neuraminidase","full-length hemagglutinin","work","possibility","therapeutic intervention","particles","summary"],"language":"en"},

The standard method of detection of viral pathogens in environmental samples uses assays in mammalian cell culture. The infected cell cultures undergo observable morphological changes called cytopathogenic effects (CPEs) that are used for the detection of viruses. Even though many viruses are culturable in several cell lines and are thus detectable by the development of CPEs in cell culture, there are several viruses, like enteric waterborne adenoviruses types 40 and 41, which are difficult to culture and do not produce clear and consistent CPE. Other viruses, like waterborne caliciviruses, have not yet been successfully grown in cell cultures. Conventional cell culture assays for the detection of viruses in environmental samples have limited sensitivity and can be labor-intensive and timeconsuming. Two advances, the PCR and microarrays, have spurred the study of viruses and should be further applied to the field of environmental virology. The ability of both DNA viruses and RNA viruses to rapidly evolve means new and emerging viral pathogens will need to be addressed. Pathogen discovery and characterization, occurrence in the environment, exposure pathways, and health outcomes via environmental exposure need to be addressed. This will likely follow a new microbial risk framework that will require focused research on some important properties of viral disease transmission. The future will require models that examine community risks and provide explicit links between the models currently under development for environmental exposure and infectious disease.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Mark; Xagoraraki, Irene; Rose, Joan B.","journal":"Perspectives in Medical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/639f9cae6d8ea551f724539159eda492da16467c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114941.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287593/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s0168-7069(07)17013-0; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168706907170130; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168706907170130","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of viruses","RNA viruses","DNA viruses","study of viruses","environmental samples","environmental exposure","mammalian cell culture","cell lines","Conventional cell culture assays","infected cell cultures","field of environmental virology","exposure pathways","emerging viral pathogens","development of CPEs","standard method of detection","models","important properties of viral disease transmission","infectious disease","waterborne caliciviruses","new microbial risk framework","enteric waterborne adenoviruses types","observable morphological changes","focused research","occurrence","cytopathogenic effects","health outcomes","sensitivity","community risks","explicit links","characterization","special challenges","Publisher Summary","microarrays","Pathogen discovery","ability","consistent CPE","advances","PCR","timeconsuming","future"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the presence of influenza viruses in the stools of adult patients consulting their general practitioner for uncomplicated acute diarrhea (AD) and the proportion of concurrent infections by enteric and influenza viruses. METHOD: A case-control study was conducted from December 2010 to April 2011. Stool specimens were collected and tested for influenza viruses A (seasonal A/H3N2 and pandemic A/H1N1) and B, and for four enteric viruses (astrovirus, group A rotavirus, human enteric adenovirus, norovirus of genogroups I \u2013 NoVGI - and genogroup II - NoVGII). RESULTS: General practitioners enrolled 138 cases and 93 controls. Of the 138 stool specimens collected, 92 (66.7%) were positive for at least one of the four enteric viruses analysed and 10 (7.2%) tested positive for one influenza virus. None of these 10 influenza positive patients reported respiratory symptoms. In five influenza-positive patients (3.6%), we also detected one enteric virus, with 4 of them being positive for influenza B (2 had co-detection with NoVGI, 1 with NoVGII, and 1 with astrovirus). None of the 93 controls tested positive for one of the enteric and/or other influenza viruses we investigated. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we showed that the simultaneous detection of influenza and enteric viruses is not a rare event. We have also reported, for the first time in general practice, the presence of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses in the stools of adult patients consulting for uncomplicated AD. A simultaneous investigation of enteric and influenza viruses in patients complaining of gastrointestinal symptoms could be useful for future studies to better identify the agents responsible for AD.","publish_time":"2012-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arena, Christophe; Amoros, Jean Pierre; Vaillant, V\u00E9ronique; Balay, Katia; Chikhi-Brachet, Roxane; Varesi, Laurent; Arrighi, Jean; Blanchon, Thierry; Carrat, Fabrice; Hanslik, Thomas; Falchi, Alessandra","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03d7c96afa37141562c3ac9297882dbe59d2e0e4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3466123.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22709374/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-9-116","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["enteric viruses","presence of influenza viruses","pandemic influenza viruses","influenza positive patients","influenza-positive patients","influenza B","simultaneous detection of influenza","influenza virus infection","simultaneous investigation of enteric","human enteric adenovirus","stools of adult patients","Gastrointestinal symptoms","presence of seasonal","General practitioners","general practice","respiratory symptoms","NoVGII","astrovirus","present study","controls","Stool specimens","case-control study","co-detection","uncomplicated acute diarrhea","norovirus of genogroups","rotavirus","uncommon manifestation","proportion of concurrent infections","future studies","cases","H3N2","METHOD","RESULTS","H1N1","time","rare event","agents responsible","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The development of a vaccine to prevent SARS should be pursued with the same urgency and cooperative spirit, as SARS is highly lethal and, if not controlled during the first few generations of transmission, is likely to become endemic in regions of the world where health-care infrastructure is underdeveloped and epidemiological control measures are weak. The scientific community already learned many important lessons from HIV vaccine development; these should be heeded. For example, consideration should be given to the development of a vaccine that will protect across regional strains of SARS, as the newly emergent coronavirus SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is proving to be variable and may be mutating in response to immune pressure.

Rapidly developing a collaborative approach to developing a SARS vaccine that will be both effective and safe is the only way to go.

Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits, including human-to-human transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms, and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease. Further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 \u003C R(0) \u2264 1) human-to-human transmissibility. We present a novel, to our knowledge, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms.

This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of current option of therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) besides COVID-19, in an attempt to identify promising therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and WANFANG DATA for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies that evaluated therapies (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy, and ribavirin-based therapy, etc.) for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The primary outcomes were mortality, virological eradication and clinical improvement, and secondary outcomes were improvement of symptoms and chest radiography results, incidence of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), utilization of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events (AEs). Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models, and the quality of evidence was appraised using GRADEpro. Eighteen articles (5 RCTs, 2 prospective cohort studies, and 11 retrospective cohort studies) involving 4,941 patients were included. Compared with control treatment, anti-coronary virus interventions significantly reduced mortality (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96; I(2) = 81.3%), remarkably ameliorate clinical improvement (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.05-2.19) and radiographical improvement (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.11-2.36, I(2) = 11.0 %), without manifesting clear effect on virological eradication, incidence of ARDS, intubation, and AEs. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids remarkably decreased mortality (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27-0.68). The lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination showed superior virological eradication and radiographical improvement with reduced rate of ARDS. Likewise, hydroxychloroquine improved radiographical result. For safety, ribavirin could induce more bradycardia, anemia and transaminitis. Meanwhile, hydroxychloroquine could increase AEs rate especially diarrhea. Overall, the quality of evidence on most outcomes were very low. In conclusion, although we could not draw a clear conclusion for the recommendation of potential therapies for COVID-19 considering the very low quality of evidence and wide heterogeneity of interventions and indications, our results may help clinicians to comprehensively understand the advantages and drawbacks of each anti-coronavirus agents on efficacy and safety profiles. Lopinavir/ritonavir combinations might observe better virological eradication capability than other anti-coronavirus agents. Conversely, ribavirin might cause more safety concerns especially bradycardia. Thus, large RCTs objectively assessing the efficacy of antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infections should be conducted with high priority.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhong, Han; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Zai-Li; Liu, Yang-Xi; Le, Ke-Jia; Cui, Min; Yu, Yue-Tian; Gu, Zhi-Chun; Gao, Yuan; Lin, Hou-Wen","journal":"Pharmacol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0cfa8eb6ed4b972ec0283b05822bf3155055d7b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7192121.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661820311804?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661820311804; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lopinavir"],"organizations":["China National Knowledge Infrastructure","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["radiographical improvement","COVID","clinical improvement","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","ribavirin-based therapy","superior virological eradication","incidence of acute respiratory disease syndrome","virological eradication capability","improvement of symptoms","prospective cohort studies","anti-coronavirus agents","retrospective cohort studies","ritonavir-based therapy","SARS-CoV","coronavirus disease","combination of ribavirin","lopinavir","ritonavir-based combination","efficacy of antiviral therapies","low quality of evidence","Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome","reduced mortality","incidence of ARDS","safety of current option of therapies","safety profiles","safety concerns","AEs rate","reduced rate of ARDS","decreased mortality","promising therapy","recommendation of potential therapies","ritonavir combinations","secondary outcomes","primary outcomes","hydroxychloroquine improved radiographical result","large RCTs","MERS","bradycardia","clear conclusion","anti-coronary virus interventions","China Science","clear effect","infected patients","wide heterogeneity of interventions","chest radiography results","China National Knowledge Infrastructure","Cochrane Library","CNKI","VIP","WANFANG DATA","randomized controlled trials","Technology Journal Database","utilization of mechanical ventilation","RRs","EMBASE","indications","control treatment","corticosteroids","adverse events","infections","advantages","drawbacks","attempt","intubation","random-effects models","CIs","confidence intervals","Summary relative risks","PubMed","clinicians","pandemic","anemia","diarrhea","Subgroup analyses","global concern","high priority","transaminitis","meta-analysis","articles","GRADEpro"],"language":"en"},

Here we create a tool based on a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to model the interaction between biosecurity practices and the probability of occurrence of four different diseases on Canadian swine farms. The benefits of using this novel approach, in comparison to other methods, is that it enables us to explore both the complex interaction and the relative importance of biosecurity practices on the probability of disease occurrence. In order to build the BBN we used two datasets. The first dataset detailed biosecurity practices employed on 218 commercial swine farms across Canada in 2010. The second dataset detailed animal health status and disease occurrence on 90 of those farms between 2010 and 2012. We used expert judgement to identify 15 biosecurity practices that were considered the most important in mitigating disease occurrence on farms. These included: proximity to other livestock holdings, the health status of purchased stock, manure disposal methods, as well as the procedures for admitting vehicles and staff. Four diseases were included in the BBN: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), (a prevalent endemic aerosol pathogen), Swine influenza (SI) (a viral respiratory aerosol pathogen), Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) (an endemic respiratory disease spread by close contact and aerosol) and Swine dysentery (SD) (an enteric disease which is re-emerging in North America). This model indicated that the probability of disease occurrence was influenced by a number of manageable biosecurity practices. Increased probability of PRRS and of MP were associated with spilt feed (feed that did not fall directly in a feeding trough), not being disposed of immediately and with manure being brought onto the farm premises and spread on land adjacent to the pigs. Increased probabilities of SI and SD were associated with the farm allowing access to visiting vehicles without cleaning or disinfection. SD was also more likely to occur when the health status of purchased stock was not known. Finally, we discuss how such a model can be used by the Canadian swine industry to quantify disease risks and to determine practices that may reduce the probability of disease occurrence.","publish_time":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cox, Ruth; Revie, Crawford W.; Hurnik, Daniel; Sanchez, Javier","journal":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eacbe79b57980fe8abca12e7293399768ffb3f72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114090.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2016.06.015; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587716301878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27544248/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587716301878","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bayesian Belief Network","BBN","PRRS"],"locations":["North America","Canada"],"keyphrases":["probability of disease occurrence","probability of occurrence","mitigating disease occurrence","disease risks","enteric disease","endemic respiratory disease","Canadian swine farms","dataset detailed biosecurity practices","Canadian swine industry","commercial swine farms","Swine influenza","Swine dysentery","relative importance of biosecurity practices","number of manageable biosecurity practices","Increased probability of PRRS","BBN","SD","model","viral respiratory aerosol pathogen","health status of purchased stock","prevalent endemic aerosol pathogen","dataset detailed animal health status","respiratory syndrome","vehicles","quantification of pathogen threats","manure disposal methods","Increased probabilities of SI","different diseases","farm premises","complex interaction","spilt feed","close contact","Mycoplasma pneumonia","priority","livestock holdings","land adjacent","Bayesian Belief Network","Abstract Identification","novel approach","tool","cleaning","comparison","procedures","access","Canada","expert judgement","resources","North America","benefits","pigs","proximity","disinfection","staff","feeding trough","order","datasets"],"language":"en"},

The disease, originally termed \u201Catypical pneumonia,\u201D was first recognized in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China, which spread rapidly to 26 countries within 5months and eventually led to 8096 human infection cases and 774 deaths. A previously unrecognized coronavirus, named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as the causative agent of SARS. Subsequent investigation indicated that the source of the human infections originated most likely from infected wildlife animals traded in the live animal markets, with masked palm civets considered the most prominent and important carrier. Large-scale culling of civets appeared to be effective in preventing further outbreaks in the region. Subsequent epidemiological studies showed that civets are intermediate host of SARS-CoV and bats are the likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and a large number of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs). Detailed analysis of the massive SARS-CoV genomic sequence data indicated that SARS-CoV experienced a strong selection pressure during different outbreak phases in humans as well as interspecies transmission from animals to humans. The spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV plays a key role in virus\u2013host interaction and hence is a key determinant of interspecies transmission. It has been shown that minor changes of amino acid (aa) residues in the S protein could lead to dramatic changes in virus susceptibility in animal and human hosts. This chapter focuses on the genetics and evolution of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs in humans, civets, and bats. The events of SARS outbreaks and the accompanying response activities highlight the importance of modern molecular epidemiology in disease investigation and the urgent need to broaden the screening and investigation of unknown viruses in wildlife animals.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shi, Z.; Wang, L.-F.","journal":"Genetics and Evolution of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d078065e748bdfbd159a9acb9fcddcbab3b5f084.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150232.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780127999425000263; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780127999425000263","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszOTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS coronavirus","evolution of SARS","intermediate host of SARS","events of SARS outbreaks","large number of SARS","causative agent of SARS","likely natural reservoir of SARS","massive SARS-CoV genomic sequence data","humans","disease investigation","SL-CoVs","Subsequent investigation","masked palm civets","infected wildlife animals","human infections","human hosts","Large-scale culling of civets","bats","key determinant of interspecies transmission","investigation of unknown viruses","human infection cases","virus susceptibility","host interaction","key role","dramatic changes","S protein","major zoonotic infectious disease","unrecognized coronavirus","live animal markets","Subsequent epidemiological studies","minor changes of amino acid","strong selection pressure","importance of modern molecular epidemiology","different outbreak phases","accompanying response activities","residues","screening","urgent need","coronaviruses","severe acute respiratory syndrome","source","genetics","Detailed analysis","deaths","Century","spike glycoprotein","important carrier","Guangdong Province","China","chapter","months","atypical pneumonia","countries","region"],"language":"en"},

Investigations of naturally occurring respiratory infections in a herd setting are an opportunity for accurate estimates of the consequences. This article presents estimates based on individual monitoring of weight and concentrate intake of several hundred bulls previous to, during and after a respiratory infection outbreak with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) as the main pathogen. The aim of the study was to analyse the association between exposure to BRSV, weight gain and feed conversion rate, quantify any change in these parameters, and estimate the duration of the change in production. RESULTS: A comparison of growth curves for the bulls that were present during the outbreak revealed that bulls with severe clinical signs had a clear and consistent trend of poorer growth rate than those with milder or no signs. The weight/age-ratio was 0.04\u20130.10 lower in the severely affected bulls, and evident throughout the study period of 8 months. A comparison of growth rates between apparently healthy bulls being present during the outbreak and a comparable group of bulls exactly 1 year later (n = 377) showed a reduced growth rate of 111 g/day in the first group. The difference amounted to 23 extra days needed to reach the reference weight. Feed conversion was also reduced by 79 g weight gain/kilogram concentrate consumed in the outbreak year. CONCLUSION: This study indicates significant negative effects on performance of animals that develop severe clinical signs in the acute stage, and that the growth and production is negatively affected many months after apparent recovery. In addition, the performance of apparently healthy animals that are exposed during an outbreak are severely negatively affected. The duration of this decrease in production in animals after recovery, or animals that have not shown disease at all, has not previously been documented. These losses will easily be underestimated, but contribute significantly to the costs for the producer. The findings emphasize the importance of BRSV infection for profitability and animal welfare in cattle husbandry. The study also illustrates that utilising intra-herd comparison of health and production parameters is a productive approach to estimate consequences of an outbreak.","publish_time":"2016-01-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klem, Thea Blystad; Kj\u00E6stad, Hans Petter; Kummen, Eiliv; Holen, Hallstein; Stokstad, Maria","journal":"Acta Vet Scand","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17d4c1e70195453379ed6529851c51d204fdc926.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4727385.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-016-0190-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26810215/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["affected bulls","respiratory infection outbreak","healthy bulls","outbreak year","production parameters","bulls previous","reduced growth rate","respiratory disease","performance of animals","comparison of growth curves","healthy animals","comparison of growth rates","g weight gain","comparable group of bulls","reference weight","associated production losses","respiratory infections","study period","severe clinical signs","feed conversion rate","individual monitoring of weight","consistent trend of poorer growth rate","importance of BRSV infection","consequences","change","months","duration","bovine respiratory syncytial virus","intra-herd comparison of health","herd setting","cattle husbandry","accurate estimates","apparent recovery","profitability","animal welfare","accounting","significant negative effects","Cost-benefit evaluation of measures","opportunity","intake","productive approach","acute stage","kilogram","exposure","association","decrease","extra days","BACKGROUND","article","CONCLUSION","findings","RESULTS","main pathogen","age-ratio","difference","Investigations","addition","costs","producer","aim"],"language":"en"},

Six RNA\u002B mutants that reside within a single complementation group mapping within the S glycoprotein gene of MHV-A59 were isolated which did not cause syncytium at the restrictive temperature. Using standard genetic techniques, a recombination map was established that indicated that these mutants mapped into two distinct domains designated F1 and F2. These genetic domains may correspond to mutations mapping within the S1 and S2 glycoproteins, respectively, and suggest that both the S1 and S2 domains are important in eliciting the fusogenic activity of the S glycoprotein gene. In addition, assuming that most distal is alleles map roughly 4.0 kb apart, a recombination frequency of 1 % per 575\u2013676 by was predicted through the S glycoprotein gene. Interestingly, this represents a threefold increase in the recombination frequency as compared to rates predicted through the polymerase region. The increase in the recombination rate was probably not due to recombination events resulting in large deletions or insertions (\u003E50 bp), but rather was probably due to a combination of homologous and nonhomologous recombination.

Unlike in the case of the vast majority of prior quarantine models in the literature, the new model includes a quarantine-adjusted incidence function for the infection rate and the quarantine of susceptible individuals suspected of being exposed to the disease (thereby making it more realistic epidemiologically). The earlier quarantine models tend to only explicitly consider individuals who are already infected, but show no clinical symptoms of the disease (i.e., those latently-infected), in the quarantine class (while ignoring the quarantine of susceptible individuals). In reality, however, the vast majority of people in quarantine (during a disease outbreak) are susceptible. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the assumed imperfect nature of quarantine (in preventing the infection of quarantined susceptible individuals) induces the phenomenon of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction threshold is less than unity (thereby making effective disease control difficult). For the case when the efficacy of quarantine to prevent infection during quarantine is perfect, the disease-free equilibrium is globally-asymptotically stable when the reproduction threshold is less than unity. Furthermore, the model has a unique endemic equilibrium when the reproduction threshold exceeds unity (and the disease persists in the population in this case).","publish_time":"2013-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Safi, Mohammad A.; Gumel, Abba B.","journal":"Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c3b3ae35af5de4b137bc3b40d6bf707c6b43cbc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125820.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022247X12008165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287386/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022247X12008165; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmaa.2012.10.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quarantine of susceptible individuals","mass quarantine","efficacy of quarantine","quarantine class","earlier quarantine models","vast majority of prior quarantine models","quarantine-adjusted incidence function","assumed imperfect nature of quarantine","communicable disease","disease outbreak","new model","unity","infection of quarantined susceptible individuals","case","associated reproduction threshold","new deterministic model","effective disease control difficult","infection rate","vast majority of people","disease-free equilibrium","unique endemic equilibrium","phenomenon of backward bifurcation","spread","literature","clinical symptoms","Rigorous analysis","reality","population"],"language":"en"},

All the Taiwanese SARS-CoV strains which associated with nosocomial infection formed a monophyletic clade within the late phase of the SARS epidemic.

Taiwan SCoVs in the first wave clustered with three isolates from the Amoy Gardens housing complex in Hong Kong indicating their possible origin.

Findings show that stigma affected most residents and took various forms of being shunned, insulted, marginalized, and rejected in the domains of work, interpersonal relationships, use of services and schooling. Stigma was also associated with psychosomatic distress. Residents\u2019 strategies for diminishing stigma varied with gender, age, education, occupation, and proximity to perceived risk factors for SARS such as residential location, previous SARS infection and the presence of ex-SARS household members. Residents attributed stigma to government mismanagement, contagiousness of the mysterious SARS virus, and alarmist media reporting. Stigma clearly decreased, but never completely disappeared, after the outbreak. The findings confirm and add to existing knowledge on the varied origins, correlates, and impacts of stigma. They also highlight the synergistic roles of inconsistent health policy responses and risk miscommunication by the media in rapidly amplifying stigma toward an unfamiliar illness. While recognizing the intrinsically stigmatizing nature of public health measures to control SARS, we recommend that a consistent inter-sectoral approach is needed to minimize stigma and to make an effective health response to future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2005-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sing; Chan, Lydia Y.Y.; Chau, Annie M.Y.; Kwok, Kathleen P.S.; Kleinman, Arthur","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/248470bd32929e3290b0a5742bffc266cdc5622b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7116975.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953605001760; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953605001760","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","AG"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["SARS-related stigma","subjective stigma","stigma research","diminishing stigma","amplifying stigma","impacts of stigma","SARS epidemic","residents of AG","mysterious SARS virus","previous SARS infection","site of community outbreak of SARS","presence of ex-SARS household members","residents of Amoy Gardens","effective health response","month outbreak","Findings","stigmatizing nature of public health measures","case study methods","risk miscommunication","synergistic roles of inconsistent health policy responses","risk factors","varied origins","Case studies","survey data","alarmist media reporting","residential location","gender","contagiousness","salience","Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","government mismanagement","self-report questionnaire","occupation","proximity","correlates","heart","interpersonal relationships","focus groups","existing knowledge","education","future outbreaks","characteristics","Hong Kong","consistent inter-sectoral approach","Residents\u2019 strategies","Block E","services","domains of work","unfamiliar illness","little examination","various forms","schooling","psychosomatic distress","total","stigmatization"],"language":"en"},

However, results are mostly available too late to have an impact on patient management. The latest developments include appropriate DNA- and RNA-based amplification techniques (both NASBA and PCR) for the detection of an extended number of agents responsible for LRTI. Real time amplification, the latest technical progress, produces, within a considerable shorter time, results with a lower risk of false positives. As results can be obtained within the same day, patient management with appropriate therapy or reduction of unnecessary antibiotic therapy in LRTI will be possible. A number of technical aspects of these amplification assays, and their advantages are discussed. The availability and use of these new diagnostic tools in virology has contributed to a better understanding of the role of respiratory viruses in LRTI. The increasing importance of the viral agents, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae in ARI is illustrated. A great proportion of ARI are caused by viruses, but their relative importance depends on the spectrum of agents covered by the diagnostic techniques and on the populations studied, the geographical location and the season. The discovery of new viruses is ongoing; examples are the hMPV and the increasing number of coronaviruses. Indications for the use of these rapid techniques in different clinical situations are discussed. Depending on the possibilities, the laboratory could optimize its diagnostic strategy by applying a combination of immunofluorescence for the detection of RSV an IFL, and a combination of real-time amplification tests for other respiratory viruses and the atypical agents. When implementing a strategy, a compromise between sensitivity, clinical utility, turn around time and cost will have to be found.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ieven, Margareta","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6847321d1e8d6821cb6c65ba171a676be55c8fa1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108459.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653207002946; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653207002946","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI","ARI","RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnostic techniques","role of respiratory viruses","LRTI","results","detection of respiratory viruses conventional culture techniques","Real time amplification","discovery of new viruses","RNA-based amplification techniques","amplification assays","rapid techniques","viral agents","spectrum of agents","atypical agents","diagnostic strategy","extended number of agents responsible","appropriate therapy","combination of real-time amplification tests","detection of RSV","number of technical aspects","patient management","increasing importance","new diagnostic tools","increasing number of coronaviruses","latest technical progress","considerable shorter time","appropriate DNA","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","clinical utility","combination of immunofluorescence","latest developments","relative importance","different clinical situations","great proportion of ARI","reduction of unnecessary antibiotic therapy","virology","hMPV","examples","NASBA","lower risk of false positives","better understanding","impact","compromise","sensitivity","IFL","populations","day","PCR","geographical location","laboratory","Abstract","season","Indications","cost","advantages","availability","gold standard","possibilities"],"language":"en"},

Herein, we report in vivo protein topology engineering using highly efficient, mechanically interlocking SpyX modules named AXB and BXA. SpyX modules are protein domains composed of p53dim (X), SpyTag (A), and SpyCatcher (B). The p53dim guides the intertwining of the two nascent protein chains followed by autocatalytic isopeptide bond formation between SpyTag and SpyCatcher to fulfill the interlocking, leading to a variety of backbone topologies. Direct expression of AXB or BXA produces protein catenanes with distinct ring sizes. Recombinant proteins containing SpyX modules are obtained either as mechanically interlocked obligate dimers if the protein of interest is fused to the N- or C-terminus of SpyX modules, or as star proteins if the protein is fused to both N- and C-termini. As examples, cellular syntheses of dimers of (GB1)(2) (where GB1 stands for immunoglobulin-binding domain B1 of streptococcal protein G) and of four-arm elastin-like star proteins were demonstrated. Comparison of the catenation efficiencies in different constructs reveals that BXA is generally much more effective than AXB, which is rationalized by the arrangement of three domains in space. Mechanical interlocking induces considerable stability enhancement. Both AXB and BXA have a melting point \u223C20 \u00B0C higher than the linear controls and the BXA catenane has a melting point ~2 \u00B0C higher than the cyclic control BX\u2019A. Notably, four-arm elastin-like star proteins demonstrate remarkable tolerance against trypsin digestion. The SpyX modules provide a convenient and versatile approach to construct unconventional protein topologies via the \u201Cassembly-reaction\u201D synergy, which opens a new horizon in protein science for stability enhancement and function reinforcement via topology engineering.","publish_time":"2017-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Dong; Wu, Wen-Hao; Liu, Ya-Jie; Wu, Xia-Ling; Cao, Yang; Song, Bo; Li, Xiaopeng; Zhang, Wen-Bin","journal":"ACS Cent Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7089fc75836770d44da4bc7d6200e81426b2d4e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cb70928ef1e8112feb2a802c88996237f95a524e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5445526.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28573210/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AXB","BXA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein domains","protein science","protein catenanes","protein topology engineering","interlocking SpyX modules","unconventional protein topologies","star proteins","nascent protein chains","Recombinant proteins","C higher","BXA catenane","C-terminus","C-termini","immunoglobulin-binding domain B1 of streptococcal protein G","melting point","SpyTag","Mechanical interlocking","SpyCatcher","arm elastin","Direct expression of AXB","GB1","p53dim","considerable stability enhancement","linear controls","linear configuration","cellular syntheses of dimers","interlocked obligate dimers","variety of backbone topologies","autocatalytic isopeptide bond formation","function reinforcement","versatile approach","new horizon","remarkable tolerance","distinct ring sizes","catenation efficiencies","different constructs","trypsin digestion","synergy","assembly-reaction","cyclic control BX\u2019A","intertwining","Comparison","examples","Image","text","arrangement","space"],"language":"en"},

A key question in the study of emerging zoonoses is how the evolution of transmission efficiency interacts with heterogeneity in contact patterns in the new host species, as this interplay influences disease dynamics and prospects for control. Here we use a synergistic mixture of models and data to tease apart the evolutionary and demographic processes controlling a host-range shift in equine H3N8-derived canine influenza virus (CIV). CIV has experienced 15 years of continuous transfer among dogs in the United States, but maintains a patchy distribution, characterized by sporadic short-lived outbreaks coupled with endemic hotspots in large animal shelters. We show that CIV has a high reproductive potential in these facilities (mean R(0) = 3.9) and that these hotspots act as refugia from the sparsely connected majority of the dog population. Intriguingly, CIV has evolved a transmission efficiency that closely matches the minimum required to persist in these refugia, leaving it poised on the extinction/invasion threshold of the host contact network. Corresponding phylogenetic analyses show strong geographic clustering in three US regions, and that the effective reproductive number of the virus (R(e)) in the general dog population is close to 1.0. Our results highlight the critical role of host contact structure in CIV dynamics, and show how host contact networks could shape the evolution of pathogen transmission efficiency. Importantly, efficient control measures could eradicate the virus, in turn minimizing the risk of future sustained transmission among companion dogs that could represent a potential new axis to the human-animal interface for influenza.","publish_time":"2014-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dalziel, Benjamin D.; Huang, Kai; Geoghegan, Jemma L.; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Dubovi, Edward J.; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Ellner, Stephen P.; Holmes, Edward C.; Parrish, Colin R.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64053a0785373722d802b6a2fac9db7489b1474e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4207809.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340642/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004455","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs2OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CIV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["host contact networks","CIV dynamics","new host species","Host-range shifts","evolution of transmission efficiency","critical role of host contact structure","contact patterns","evolution of pathogen transmission efficiency","risk of future sustained transmission","refugia","equine H3N8-derived canine influenza virus","potential new axis","high reproductive potential","general dog population","companion dogs","endemic hotspots","hotspots act","mean R","major risk factor","human-animal interface","effective reproductive number","large animal shelters","efficient control measures","interplay influences disease dynamics","strong geographic clustering","sporadic short-lived outbreaks","heterogeneity","US regions","patchy distribution","Corresponding phylogenetic analyses","United States","prospects","facilities","invasion threshold","study of emerging zoonoses","years of continuous transfer","connected majority","demographic processes","data","turn","key question","synergistic mixture of models","pandemics","extinction","results","minimum"],"language":"en"},

Because the direct cultivation of primary porcine enterocytes is difficult, alternatives have to be considered. As subepithelial myofibroblasts secrete extracellular matrix and growth factors contributing to the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of epithelial cells, co-cultures of primary porcine enterocytes (ileocytes and colonocytes) with myofibroblasts were developed and evaluated for their susceptibility to enteric viruses. First, it was demonstrated that the co-cultured ileocytes and colonocytes were susceptible to an archival rotavirus strain RVA/pig-tc/BEL/RV277/1977/G1P[7] and different other rotavirus genotypes (fecal samples containing G5P[7], G5P[13], G9P[23], G4P[6]). Next, the TGEV Purdue strain infected both ileocytes and colonocytes whereas the Miller strain only infected ileocytes. Last, the PEDV CV777 Vero adapted and non-adapted (fecal suspension) strains could infect co-cultured ileocytes but not colonocytes. The infectivity of the CV777 Vero adapted strain was higher when the cells were cultured without fetal bovine serum and the CV777 fecal suspension only infected the ileocytes cultured without fetal bovine serum. In conclusion, a novel co-culture of porcine enterocytes with myofibroblasts was established, which can be used for the investigation of the replication of enteric viruses.","publish_time":"2018-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cui, Tingting; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Desmarets, Lowiese M.

The biennial C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency Workshops resulted from a European initiative for better knowledge and treatment of HAE and related diseases. This supplement contains work presented at the third workshop and expanded content toward a definitive picture of angioedema in the absence of allergy. Most notably, it includes cumulative genetic investigations; multinational laboratory diagnosis recommendations; current pathogenesis hypotheses; suggested prophylaxis and acute attack treatment, including home treatment; future treatment options; and analysis of patient subpopulations, including pediatric patients and patients whose angioedema worsened during pregnancy or hormone administration. Causes and management of acquired angioedema and a new type of angioedema with normal C1-INH are also discussed. Collaborative patient and physician efforts, crucial in rare diseases, are emphasized. This supplement seeks to raise awareness and aid diagnosis of HAE, optimize treatment for all patients, and provide a platform for further research in this rare, partially understood disorder.","publish_time":"2004-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agostoni, Angelo; Ayg\u00F6ren-P\u00FCrs\u00FCn, Emel; Binkley, Karen E.; Blanch, Alvaro; Bork, Konrad; Bouillet, Laurence; Bucher, Christoph; Castaldo, Anthony J; Cicardi, Marco; Davis, Alvin E; De Carolis, Caterina; Drouet, Christian; Duponchel, Christiane; Farkas, Henriette; F\u00E1y, K\u00E1lm\u00E1n; Fekete, B\u00E9la; Fischer, Bettina; Fontana, Luigi; F\u00FCst, George; Giacomelli, Roberto; Gr\u00F6ner, Albrecht; Erik Hack, C.; Harmat, George; Jakenfelds, John; Juers, Mathias; Kalm\u00E1r, Lajos; Kaposi, P\u00E1l N.; Kar\u00E1di, Istv\u00E1n; Kitzinger, Arianna; Koll\u00E1r, T\u00EDmea; Kreuz, Wolfhart; Lakatos, Peter; Longhurst, Hilary J.; Lopez-Trascasa, Margarita; Martinez-Saguer, Inmaculada; Monnier, Nicole; Nagy, Istv\u00E1n; N\u00E9meth, \u00C9va; Nielsen, Erik Waage; Nuijens, Jan H.; O\u0027Grady, Caroline; Pappalardo, Emanuela; Penna, Vincenzo; Perricone, Carlo; Perricone, Roberto; Rauch, Ursula; Roche, Olga; Rusicke, Eva; Sp\u00E4th, Peter J; Szendei, George; Tak\u00E1cs, Edit; Tordai, Attila; Truedsson, Lennart; Varga, Lilian; Visy, Be\u00E1ta; Williams, Kayla; Zanichelli, Andrea; Zingale, Lorenza","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ee786c268711dc91475fd86bccb7662bb8a0994a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119155.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674904017579; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674904017579","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency Workshops","HAE"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["treatment of HAE","acute attack treatment","home treatment","availability of C1","normal C1-INH","Hereditary angioedema","rare diseases","future treatment options","aid diagnosis of HAE","definitive picture of angioedema","new type of angioedema","biennial C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency Workshops","acute attacks of facial","pediatric patients","INH replacement","supplement","safe acute attack therapy","multinational laboratory diagnosis recommendations","Collaborative patient","related diseases","Low awareness","abdominal pain secondary","intra-abdominal edema","analysis of patient subpopulations","current pathogenesis hypotheses","suggested prophylaxis","peripheral swelling","European initiative","genital","laryngeal","physician efforts","manifests","countries","cumulative genetic investigations","better knowledge","life-threatening condition","disorders","complement system component","expanded content","resemblance","pregnancy","mutations","United States","research","hormone administration","absence of allergy","platform","understood disorder","management","antihistamines","corticosteroids"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments demonstrated that recombination events had occurred in the origin and evolution of the strains CK/CH/LSD/03I and CK/CH/LLN/98I and the possible recombinant junction sites might be located at the 3c and M genes, respectively.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role within the innate immune system and TLR7 agonists have previously been shown to up-regulate Th1 responses and down-regulate Th2 responses to allergens in murine models of allergic or chronic asthma. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of the novel TRL7 agonist AZD8848, which has been developed as an antedrug. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, AZD8848 60 \u03BCg or placebo was administered intranasally once-weekly for 8 weeks in patients with mild-to-moderate allergic asthma (NCT00999466). Efficacy assessments were performed at 1 and 4 weeks after the last dose. The primary outcome was the late asthmatic response (LAR) fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) after allergen challenge at 1-week post-treatment. RESULTS: AZD8848 significantly reduced average LAR fall in FEV(1) by 27% vs. placebo at 1 week after treatment (p = 0.035). This effect was sustained at 4 weeks post-treatment; however, it did not reach clinical significance. AZD8848 reduced post-allergen challenge methacholine-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) vs. placebo at 1 week post-dosing (treatment ratio: 2.20, p = 0.024), with no effect at 4 weeks. There was no significant difference between the two groups in plasma cytokine, sputum Th2 cytokine or eosinophil responses post-allergen challenge at 1 week after treatment. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. AZD8848 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In patients with allergic asthma, TLR7 agonists could potentially reduce allergen responsiveness by stimulating Type 1 interferon responses to down-regulate the dominant Th2 responses.

In spring 2014, a sudden rise in the number of notified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections occurred across Saudi Arabia with a focus in Jeddah. Hypotheses to explain the outbreak pattern include increased surveillance, increased zoonotic transmission, nosocomial transmission, and changes in viral transmissibility, as well as diagnostic laboratory artifacts. Methods. Diagnostic results from Jeddah Regional Laboratory were analyzed. Viruses from the Jeddah outbreak and viruses occurring during the same time in Riyadh, Al-Kharj, and Madinah were fully or partially sequenced. A set of 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms distinctive to the Jeddah outbreak were determined from additional viruses. Viruses from Riyadh and Jeddah were isolated and studied in cell culture. Results. Up to 481 samples were received per day for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. A laboratory proficiency assessment suggested positive and negative results to be reliable. Forty-nine percent of 168 positive-testing samples during the Jeddah outbreak stemmed from King Fahd Hospital. All viruses from Jeddah were monophyletic and similar, whereas viruses from Riyadh were paraphyletic and diverse. A hospital-associated transmission cluster, to which cases in Indiana (United States) and the Netherlands belonged, was discovered in Riyadh. One Jeddah-type virus was found in Riyadh, with matching travel history to Jeddah. Virus isolates representing outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh were not different from MERS-CoV EMC/2012 in replication, escape of interferon response, or serum neutralization. Conclusions. Virus shedding and virus functions did not change significantly during the outbreak in Jeddah.

AA-theory is based on renal pathohistological similarities between Chinese herbs nephropathy (CHN) and EN, findings of AA-DNA adducts in EN and in patients with urinary tract tumors (UTT), as well as the domination of A:T\u00AET:A transversions in the p53 mutational spectrum of UTT patients, which corresponds with findings of such mutations in AA-treated rats. However, exposure pathways of EN residents to AA are unclear. Experimental studies attempting to deduce whether nephrotoxins OTA and CIT appear at higher frequencies or levels (or both) in the food and blood or urine of EN residents support the mycotoxin theory.

Indirect fluorescence assay was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates for the identification of respiratory viruses [respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3, influenza A and B and hMPV]. Moreover, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was done to further confirm the hMPV infection. RESULTS: In this case series, hMPV infection showed a range of respiratory symptoms from common cold to life threatening lower respiratory tract infections with varying severity. In some cases, the clinical presentation of hMPV infection was similar to the ARTI caused by RSV. hMPV co-infections with of RSV have also been seen in some cases of ARTI.

World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 Feb 20 named this disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as Covid-19. This pandemic is spreading rapidly and more than 20,00,000 cases have occurred globally. The human Coronaviruses discovered in 1960s were considered potentially harmless endemic viruses with seasonal distribution before late 2002. The CoVs are found in a large number of domestic and wild animals and birds. The first pandemic caused by Coronavirus caused by SARS-CoV was recognized in the late 2002 in Guangdong Province and resulted in widespread morbidity and mortality. This was followed by MERS-CoV which began in 2012 in the Arabian peninsula with multiple outbreaks related to it in various parts of the globe. Various studies have suggested how these viruses made their entry from their natural reservoir bats via intermediate host like civets and camels in case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively. The intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 still needs to be established. The SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% similarity to the bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related-Coronavirus (SARSr-CoV RaTG13). SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be more distant in relation to SARS-CoV (79%) and MERS-CoV (50%). At the whole genome sequence level pangolin CoV and SARSr-CoV RaTG13 show 91.02% and 96.2% similarity with SARS-CoV-2 but the S1 subunit of spike protein of pangolin CoV is more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than SARSr-CoV RaTG13. The genetic analysis of the currently circulating strains of the pandemic have shown 99.98-100% similarity in their genomes implying a recent shift to humans. The animal source of SARS-CoV-2 needs to be identified to implement control measures in the present pandemic. Also, how the virus moves interspecies will help predict and prevent future pandemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anand, K.B.; Karade, S.; Sen, S.; Gupta, R.M.","journal":"Med J Armed Forces India","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eccbbe49aacebe62e1b4c127406aace517118294.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7183968.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2020.04.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377123720300691; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377123720300691?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs4OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organisation"],"locations":["Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","SARSr-CoV RaTG13","case of SARS","genome sequence level pangolin CoV","animal source of SARS","S1 subunit of spike protein of pangolin CoV","similarity","present pandemic","intermediate host","CoVs","globe","face","various parts","Various studies","strain of Coronaviruses","human Coronaviruses","harmless endemic viruses","World Health Organisation","civets","natural reservoir bats","bat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","camels","wild animals","large number of domestic","seasonal distribution","multiple outbreaks","widespread morbidity","Guangdong Province","entry","genomes","subgenus Sarbecovirus of genus Betacoronavirus","recent shift","humans","Arabian peninsula","birds","strains","control measures","relation","genetic analysis","mortality","disease","Covid","future pandemics","cases"],"language":"en"},

The current limitations on accessibility to non-urgent care undermine postoperative monitoring of patients who have undergone such operations. Furthermore, like most elective surgery, new bariatric and metabolic procedures are being postponed worldwide during the pandemic. When the outbreak abates, a backlog of people seeking these operations will exist. Hence, surgical candidates face prolonged delays of beneficial treatment. Because of the progressive nature of obesity and diabetes, delaying surgery increases risks for morbidity and mortality, thus requiring strategies to mitigate harm. The risk of harm, however, varies among patients, depending on the type and severity of their comorbidities. A triaging strategy is therefore needed. The traditional weight-centric patient-selection criteria do not favour cases based on actual clinical needs. In this Personal View, experts from the Diabetes Surgery Summit consensus conference series provide guidance for the management of patients while surgery is delayed and for postoperative surveillance. We also offer a strategy to prioritise bariatric and metabolic surgery candidates on the basis of the diseases that are most likely to be ameliorated postoperatively.

Here we analyzed the epidemiological features of China, South Korea, Italy and Spain to find out the relationship of major public health events and epidemiological curves. Study design In this study we describe and analyze the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in and outside China. We use GAM to generate the epidemiological curves and simulate infection curves with reported incubation period. Results The epidemiological curved derived from the GAM suggested that the infection curve can reflect the public health measurements sensitively. Under the massive actions token in China, the infection curve flattened at 23rd of January. While surprisingly, even before Wuhan lockdown and first level response of public emergency in Guangdong and Shanghai, those infection curve came to the reflection point both at 21st of January, which indicated the mask wearing by the public before 21st Jan were the key measure to cut off the transmission. In the countries outside China, infection curve also changed in response to measures, but its rate of decline was much smaller than the curve of China\u0027s. Conclusion The present analysis comparing the epidemiological curves in China, South Korea, Italy and Spain supports the importance of mask wearing by the public. Analysis of the infection curve helped to clarify the impact of important public health events, evaluate the efficiencies of prevention measures, and showed wearing masks in public resulted in significantly reduced daily infected cases.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Nianyi; Li, Zewen; Ng, Sherrianne; Chen, Dingqiang; Zhou, Hongwei","journal":"Medicine in Microecology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6e20e12e75eaf26c3e7660549ce0a30d536ebc0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590097820300124; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medmic.2020.100015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590097820300124","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GAM"],"locations":["Spain","Guangdong","China","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["epidemiological curves","infection curves","epidemiological features of China","public health measurements","curve of China\u0027s","outside China","epidemiological characteristics of COVID","relationship of major public health events","impact of important public health events","level response of public emergency","South Korea","Spain","Italy","GAM","present analysis","importance of mask","Study design","efficiencies of prevention measures","Guangdong","pandemic","Coronavirus disease","Shanghai","reported incubation period","Abstract Objective","rate of decline","Wuhan lockdown","Conclusion","masks","countries","key measure","massive actions","transmission","reflection","greatest concern","infected cases"],"language":"en"},

In order to compare NIPE and CBS values during the whole T1 to T3 period, the variable Dif-CBS was defined as the difference between maximal and minimal CBS scores, and Dif-NIPE as the difference between 75th and 25th percentile NIPE values. Analyses were carried out, firstly for the total of nebulizations and secondly comparing two different nebulization systems: a jet nebulizer (JN) and a nebulizer integrated in high flow nasal cannulas (NHF). 84 nebulizations were recorded on 14 patients with a median [25th\u201375th percentile] age of 6 months (3.1\u20139.5). A Dif-CBS of 4 points (2\u20137), as well as changes in CBS scores between T1 and T2, defined the nebulization as a discomfort stimulus.

Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively control COVID-19 than active monitoring. As an epidemic grows, it is also important to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible and broader mitigation measures must be implemented. Methods To estimate the comparative efficacy of individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts to control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we fit a stochastic branching model to reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Specifically, we fit a model to the incubation period distribution (mean 5\u00B72 days) and to two estimates of the serial interval distribution: a shorter one with a mean serial interval of 4\u00B78 days and a longer one with a mean of 7\u00B75 days. To assess variable resource settings, we considered two feasibility settings: a high-feasibility setting with 90% of contacts traced, a half-day average delay in tracing and symptom recognition, and 90% effective isolation; and a low-feasibility setting with 50% of contacts traced, a 2-day average delay, and 50% effective isolation. Findings Model fitting by sequential Monte Carlo resulted in a mean time of infectiousness onset before symptom onset of 0\u00B777 days (95% CI \u22121\u00B798 to 0\u00B729) for the shorter serial interval, and for the longer serial interval it resulted in a mean time of infectiousness onset after symptom onset of 0\u00B751 days (95% CI \u22120\u00B777 to 1\u00B750). Individual quarantine in high-feasibility settings, where at least 75% of infected contacts are individually quarantined, contains an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 with a short serial interval (4\u00B78 days) 84% of the time. However, in settings where the outbreak continues to grow (eg, low-feasibility settings), so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine, particularly uninfected contacts (who never develop symptoms). When resources are prioritised for scalable interventions such as physical distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to mitigation efforts. Even under the shorter serial interval, if physical distancing reduces the reproductive number to 1\u00B725, active monitoring of 50% of contacts can result in overall outbreak control (ie, effective reproductive number \u003C1). Interpretation Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost\u2013benefit comparisons of individual quarantine versus active monitoring of contacts. To the extent that these interventions can be implemented, they can help mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Despite the common use of vitamin B6 to control vomiting in children with gastroenteritis, no study has been performed in this field. This study aimed to assess the value of vitamin B6 in the prevention of vomiting in patients with mild to moderate gastroenteritis. METHODOLOGY: This study was a double blind controlled clinical trial on 96 children with mild to moderate gastroenteritis with age range of 6 months to 12 years admitted in Mofid Children\u2019s Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups of 48 subjects matched for age, sex and symptoms of dehydration. Vitamin B6 was given in case group and control group was given placebo. The severity of dehydration and vomiting in patients before and after treatment were evaluated by a physician. All data were recorded in the questionnaire and results in the two treatment groups were compared by using SPSS software (Version 15, Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: The mean \u00B1 SD age of patients whom underwent Vitamin B6 treatment was 2.9\u00B12.4 versus 2.5\u00B12 in placebo group. Significant difference between mean age, gender, and severity of dehydration in children of two groups wasn\u2019t observed. After treatment in both treatment groups, 40 patients (83.3%) had mild dehydration, and 8 patients (16.7%) had moderate dehydration. Vomiting was noted in 28 patients (58.3%) after treatment with vitamin B6 and in 37 patients (77.1%) after treatment with placebo. The mean frequency of vomiting after treatment with vitamin B6 was 1.7\u00B11.3 times and in the control group (treated with distilled water) was 1.5\u00B10.77 time, but no significant difference between the severity of dehydration, controlling vomiting and the mean frequency of vomiting was observed in both groups (P\u003E0.05). CONCLUSION: It seems that the use of oral vitamin B6 treatment has no benefit and impact compared with the placebo. Thus, use of vitamin B6 in the prevention of vomiting due to acute mild to moderate gastroenteritis is not only scientifically, but in the present study it was proved to be ineffective. This work was done on a comparative basis and further researches are recommended.","publish_time":"2013-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Derakhshanfar, Hojjat; Amree, Arash Hadian; Alimohammadi, Hossein; Shojahe, Majid; Sharami, Ali","journal":"Glob J Health Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/089e3ad66a42e4d2cbea7e7414db7f59208a36dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4776878.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5539/gjhs.v5n6p197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24171888/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Vitamin B6"],"organizations":["Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences","SPSS"],"locations":["Iran"],"keyphrases":["treatment groups","use of oral vitamin B6 treatment","value of vitamin B6","common use of vitamin B6","mild dehydration","prevention of vomiting","moderate dehydration","mean frequency of vomiting","moderate gastroenteritis","severity of dehydration","SD age of patients","mean age","placebo group","control group","symptoms of dehydration","age range","case group","present study","Significant difference","results","common childhood diseases","Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences","Mofid Children\u2019s Hospital","double blind controlled clinical trial","respiratory tract infections","gender","benefit","Chicago","Tehran","years","months","SPSS software","Version","BACKGROUND","sex","impact","times","distilled water","comparative basis","Iran","questionnaire","subjects","work","researches","USA","METHODOLOGY","data","CONCLUSION","field","physician"],"language":"en"},

One hundred twenty diverse bread wheat genotypes were used in a pot experiment to explore the relationship among their fifteen physio-biochemical traits (PBT) by using multivariate analysis, heatmapping and stress tolerance index (STI) for grain yield as a marker trait to identify high yielding genotype with maximum stress tolerance capability. Increased proline and sugar accumulation were observed from control to moisture deficient environments by 159% and 122%, respectively. Moreover, leaf membrane stability index (LMSI), leaf relative water content (LRWC), relative dry weight (RDW), chlorophyll content, leaf surface area (LSA), Leaf succulence (LS), canopy temperature depression (CTD), relative excised leaf water loss (RELWL) and leaf osmotic potential (LOP) showed significantly decreasing trend in drought stress treatment as compared to well-watered plants by \u221221%, \u221221%, \u221234%, \u221222%, \u221238%, \u221237%, \u221246%, \u221218% and \u221235% respectively. Additionally, principal component analysis and genotype by trait biplot analysis showed that initial 7 principal components (PC1 to PC7) represented 77.27% and 79.02% of total cumulative variation under control and drought stress respectively. Genotypic-Phenotypic correlation revealed that most of the attributes were higher in case of genotypic correlation component (rg) as compared to the phenotypic correlation component (rp) indicating more genetic association between traits. The darker and lighter colour scale produced by heatmap exhibited contrasting nature of genotypes, as positive side with higher values represented drought resistance while values on the negative side with lower values showed susceptible performance of genotypes. Our results concluded that the studied PBT associated with STI for grain yield are the main factors which may contribute in improved productivity of wheat crop and if these traits show appropriate performance under stress condition the crop will show the more productive returns under changing climate.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmed, Kashif; Shabbir, Ghulam; Ahmed, Mukhtar; Shah, Kausar Nawaz","journal":"Sci Total Environ","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139082; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720325997?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32371202/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720325997","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["STI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Leaf succulence","drought stress treatment","stress tolerance index","stress condition","principal component analysis","leaf surface area","leaf osmotic potential","phenotypic correlation component","relative excised leaf water loss","higher values","crop productivity","leaf membrane stability index","drought resistance","Abstract Drought","relative water content","Genotypic-Phenotypic correlation","maximum stress tolerance capability","case of genotypic correlation component","trait biplot analysis","multivariate analysis","lower values","grain yield","control","improved productivity of wheat crop","susceptible performance of genotypes","diverse bread wheat genotypes","relative dry weight","contrasting nature of genotypes","physio-biochemical traits","chlorophyll content","marker trait","principal components","appropriate performance","studied PBT","main factors","high yielding genotype","prominent limiting factors","RELWL","CTD","LSA","LMSI","canopy temperature depression","RDW","LRWC","heatmapping","lighter colour scale","rp","rg","total cumulative variation","sugar accumulation","relationship","PC1","productive returns","well-watered plants","attributes","pot experiment","genetic association","moisture deficient environments","changing climate","Increased proline","PC7","physiological pathway","trend","results"],"language":"en"},

To regulate this activity, macrodomain proteins enzymatically remove covalently attached ADP-ribose from protein targets. All members of the Coronavirinae, a subfamily of positive-sense RNA viruses, contain a highly conserved macrodomain within nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). However, its function or targets during infection remain unknown. We identified several macrodomain mutations that greatly reduced nsp3\u2019s de-ADP-ribosylation activity in vitro. Next, we created recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains with these mutations. These mutations led to virus attenuation and a modest reduction of viral loads in infected mice, despite normal replication in cell culture. Further, macrodomain mutant virus elicited an early, enhanced interferon (IFN), interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), and proinflammatory cytokine response in mice and in a human bronchial epithelial cell line. Using a coinfection assay, we found that inclusion of mutant virus in the inoculum protected mice from an otherwise lethal SARS-CoV infection without reducing virus loads, indicating that the changes in innate immune response were physiologically significant. In conclusion, we have established a novel function for the SARS-CoV macrodomain that implicates ADP-ribose in the regulation of the innate immune response and helps to demonstrate why this domain is conserved in CoVs.","publish_time":"2016-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fehr, Anthony R.; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Jankevicius, Gytis; Fett, Craig; Zhao, Jincun; Athmer, Jeremiah; Meyerholz, David K.; Ahel, Ivan; Perlman, Stanley","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/788295abb7003fc90fdadb54283b664724c83b33.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5156301.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27965448/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01721-16","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["macrodomain mutations","SARS-CoV macrodomain","macrodomain mutant virus","conserved macrodomain","virus loads","macrodomain proteins","innate immune response","virus attenuation","attached ADP-ribose","inclusion of mutant virus","lethal SARS-CoV infection","infected mice","s de-ADP-ribosylation activity","protein targets","proinflammatory cytokine response","impact innate immunity","enhanced interferon","reduced nsp3","nonstructural protein","cell culture","novel function","interferon-stimulated gene","modest reduction of viral loads","human bronchial epithelial cell line","antiviral properties","recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","IFN","ISG","subfamily of positive","normal replication","common posttranslational modification","sense RNA viruses","inoculum","changes","regulation","strains","Coronavirinae","coinfection assay","members","CoVs","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

However, the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches continues to be one of much debate and there is a need for a rigorous framework for designing and interpreting mixed methods research. This paper explores the analytical approaches (i.e. parallel, concurrent or sequential) used in mixed methods studies within healthcare and exemplifies the use of triangulation as a methodological metaphor for drawing inferences from qualitative and quantitative findings originating from such analyses. Design This review of the literature used systematic principles in searching CINAHL, Medline and PsycINFO for healthcare research studies which employed a mixed methods approach and were published in the English language between January 1999 and September 2009. Results In total, 168 studies were included in the results. Most studies originated in the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. The analytic approach most widely used was parallel data analysis. A number of studies used sequential data analysis; far fewer studies employed concurrent data analysis. Very few of these studies clearly articulated the purpose for using a mixed methods design. The use of the methodological metaphor of triangulation on convergent, complementary, and divergent results from mixed methods studies is exemplified and an example of developing theory from such data is provided. Conclusion A trend for conducting parallel data analysis on quantitative and qualitative data in mixed methods healthcare research has been identified in the studies included in this review. Using triangulation as a methodological metaphor can facilitate the integration of qualitative and quantitative findings, help researchers to clarify their theoretical propositions and the basis of their results. This can offer a better understanding of the links between theory and empirical findings, challenge theoretical assumptions and develop new theory.","publish_time":"2011-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00D6stlund, Ulrika; Kidd, Lisa; Wengstr\u00F6m, Yvonne; Rowa-Dewar, Neneh","journal":"International Journal of Nursing Studies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d3b94b2c0ce0137138bb29e65bd37466cf233b14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094322.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.10.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748910003639; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020748910003639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21084086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States of America","United Kingdom","Canada"],"keyphrases":["mixed methods studies","mixed methods research","healthcare research studies","mixed methods design","mixed methods healthcare research","qualitative data","fewer studies","number of studies","parallel data analysis","sequential data analysis","concurrent data analysis","quantitative findings","integration of qualitative","methodological metaphor of triangulation","quantitative approaches","use of triangulation","divergent results","empirical findings","new theory","review","example of developing theory","theoretical assumptions","United Kingdom","theoretical propositions","analytical approaches","analytic approach","United States of America","Medline","drawing inferences","CINAHL","nursing","systematic principles","USA","links","PsycINFO","researchers","health science","complexity","literature","trend","purpose","rigorous framework","need","UK","Canada","better understanding","basis","Conclusion","phenomena","paper","analyses","total","Abstract Objectives","English language","debate"],"language":"en"},

However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those institutions without such facilities or 2019-nCoV. This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV-related coronavirus model. METHODS: A 2019-nCoV-related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2V uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2V infection. The anti-viral activities and anti-viral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS: The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs, including cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride, exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 \u03BCmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC(50)] of 0.98 \u03BCmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 \u03BCmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 \u00B1 0.02] \u00D7 10(\u22124)vs. 1.00 \u00B1 0.12, t = 150.38, P \u003C 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 \u03BCmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP had potent anti-viral activities against both viral entry (0.46 \u00B1 0.12, vs.1.00 \u00B1 0.37 t = 2.42, P \u003C 0.05) and viral replication ([6.18 \u00B1 0.95] \u00D7 10(\u22124)vs. 1.00 \u00B1 0.43, t = 3.98, P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin, and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection.

However, clinical data regarding utilization of the multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs are lacking. METHODS: We investigated the utilization of the multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs at Chung-Ang University Hospital in Seoul, Korea, between January 2012 and April 2013. RESULTS: During the study period, the multiplex RT-PCR test was performed for 291 adult patients. The test frequency was 4.9% of rapid influenza antigen detection tests and 0.8% of respiratory bacterial culture studies. A turnaround time of \u003C 48 hours was observed in 25.9% of positive tests. Most of the tests were performed for admitted patients (97.9%) with a community-acquired infection (84.2%) during the flu season (82.5%). RVs were detected in 81 of 291 cases (27.8%). The RV positivity rates for community- and hospital-acquired infections did not differ (28.6% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.52). Of 166 patients with pneumonia, 44 (26.5%) had a viral infection. Among the patients with RV-associated pneumonia, an RV other than influenza was detected in 20 patients (45.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs was infrequently performed at a tertiary care center, and the test results were often reported late. The test was most often performed for admitted adult patients with community-acquired infections during the flu season. The utilization of multiplex RT-PCR testing for RVs in current clinical practice should be improved.","publish_time":"2014-12-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahn, Mi Young; Choi, Seong-Ho; Chung, Jin-Won; Kim, Hye Ryoun","journal":"Korean J Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0eed9647904ba87a841a177c12a0238faf5c2bd0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4293570.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589841/; https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2015.30.1.96","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chung-Ang University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RVs","adult patients","test results","utilization of multiplex RT-PCR testing","test frequency","respiratory infections","community","Respiratory viruses","important respiratory pathogens","RV-associated pneumonia","positive tests","flu season","multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction","respiratory bacterial culture studies","RV positivity rates","rapid influenza antigen detection tests","clinical data","viral infection","current clinical practice","Chung-Ang University Hospital","Seoul","study period","Korea","tertiary care center","AIMS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","turnaround time","hours","METHODS","cases"],"language":"en"},

As lung is steadily exposed to multiple infectious agents, antigens and host-derived danger signals, the inhabiting stromal and myeloid cells of the lung express an aggregate of TLRs which perceive the endogenously derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) along with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger the TLR-associated signalling events involved in host defence. Thus, they form an imperative component of host defence activation in case of microbial infections as well as non-infectious pulmonary disorders such as interstitial lung disease, acute lung injury and airways disease, such as COPD and asthma. They also play an equally important role in lung cancer. Targeting the TLR signalling network would pave ways to the design of more reliable and effective vaccines against infectious agents and control deadly infections, desensitize allergens and reduce inflammation. Moreover, TLR agonists may act as adjuvants by increasing the efficiency of cancer vaccines, thereby contributing their role in treatment of lung cancer too. Overall, TLRs present a compelling and expeditiously bolstered area of research and addressing their signalling events would be of significant use in pulmonary diseases.","publish_time":"2019-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arora, Shweta; Ahmad, Shaniya; Irshad, Rasha; Goyal, Yamini; Rafat, Sahar; Siddiqui, Neha; Dev, Kapil; Husain, Mohammad; Ali, Shakir; Mohan, Anant; Syed, Mansoor Ali","journal":"Life Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e87197f407ee7d0428c28ec1a6983c3aa0167b03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094289.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320519305971; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.116671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336122/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320519305971","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD","TLR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment of lung cancer","interstitial lung disease","acute lung injury","signalling events","TLR signalling network","molecular patterns","efficiency of cancer vaccines","aggregate of TLRs","TLR agonists","host-derived danger signals","multiple infectious agents","imperative component of host defence activation","airways disease","effective vaccines","derived damage","pulmonary diseases","important role","control deadly infections","case of microbial infections","non-infectious pulmonary disorders","antigens","design","myeloid cells","DAMPs","significant use","bolstered area of research","suitable response","identification","allergens","receptors","adjuvants","PAMPs","clan of proteins","pathogenic attacks","COPD","Abstract Toll","inflammation","asthma"],"language":"en"},

To test the neutralising capacity of these antisera in vivo, susceptibility to MERS-CoV was induced in naive recipient Balb/c mice by the administration of an adenovirus vector expressing the human DPP4 receptor (Ad5-hDPP4) for MERS-CoV, prior to the passive transfer of the RBD-specific murine antisera to the transduced mice. Subsequent challenge of the recipient transduced mice by the intra-nasal route with a clinical isolate of the MERS-CoV resulted in a significantly reduced viral load in their lungs, compared with transduced mice receiving a negative control antibody. The murine antisera used were derived from mice which had been primed sub-cutaneously with a recombinant fusion of RBD with a human IgG Fc tag (RBD-Fc), adsorbed to calcium phosphate microcrystals and then boosted by the oral route with the same fusion protein in reverse micelles.

Case fatality rates of filovirus disease outbreaks are among the highest reported for any human pathogen, exceeding 90% (ref. 1). Licensed therapeutic or vaccine products are not available to treat filovirus diseases. Candidate therapeutics previously shown to be efficacious in non-human primate disease models are based on virus-specific designs and have limited broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Here we show that BCX4430, a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, inhibits infection of distinct filoviruses in human cells. Biochemical, reporter-based and primer-extension assays indicate that BCX4430 inhibits viral RNA polymerase function, acting as a non-obligate RNA chain terminator. Post-exposure intramuscular administration of BCX4430 protects against Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease in rodent models. Most importantly, BCX4430 completely protects cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection when administered as late as 48 hours after infection. In addition, BCX4430 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous viruses, including bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of non-human primate protection from filovirus disease by a synthetic drug-like small molecule. We provide additional pharmacological characterizations supporting the potential development of BCX4430 as a countermeasure against human filovirus diseases and other viral diseases representing major public health threats.

The S100A9 is a member of the DAMPs protein family and, is released by activated phagocytic cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages or endothelial cells, and S100A9 induces its effect through TLR4/MyD88 pathway. Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is one of the major devastating disease in the cattle industry worldwide. It shows its effect through immunosuppression and develops persistent infection in calves born from infected cows. The current study revealed that BVDV potentially induced immunosuppression by the interaction of BVDV Npro protein with cellular S100A9 protein. The Inhibition of S100A9 protein expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced the virus replication in infected cells. Overexpression of bovine S100A9 enhanced the ncpBVDV2a 1373 mediated Type-I interferon production. A co-immunoprecipitation experiment demonstrated a strong interaction between ncp BVDV2a 1373 Npro protein and cellular S100A9 protein. This suggested that BVDV Npro reduced the S100A9 protein availability/activity in infected cells, resulting in reduced Type-I interferon production. A further study of S100A9-BVDV interaction will be need for better understanding of BVDV pathophysiology.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Darweesh, Mahmoud F.; Rajput, Mrigendra K.S.; Braun, Lyle J.; Rohila, Jai S.; Chase, Christopher C.L.","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0887d72928848c7c8dfea2b737af6ad098fd5bbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127600.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882401018307654; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401018307654; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2018.05.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29859294/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BVDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular S100A9 protein","S100A9 protein availability","study of S100A9","interaction of BVDV Npro protein","BVDV interaction","Inhibition of S100A9 protein expression","Overexpression of bovine S100A9","infected cells","DAMPs protein family","endothelial cells","phagocytic cells","better understanding of BVDV pathophysiology","strong interaction","infected cows","effect","reduced Type","innate immune response","interferon production","mediated Type","induced immunosuppression","virus replication","Bovine viral diarrhea virus","current study","ncp BVDV2a","small interfering RNA","danger","siRNA","various receptor interactions","monocytes","ncpBVDV2a","persistent infection","neutrophils","calves","macrophages","activity","molecular patterns","major devastating disease","co-immunoprecipitation experiment","cattle industry","TLR4","body\u0027s antiviral defense system","member","MyD88 pathway"],"language":"en"},

This real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR test was used to examine a panel of field samples and its performance compared to virus isolation in embryonated fowls\u2019 eggs. A total of 323 field samples were tested; 176 samples were positive using the real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR method, but only three were positive by virus isolation. Sequencing was used to confirm the positive real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR results for a subset of samples. The test is suitable for swabs and post\u2010mortem samples and has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific. The second test, a genotyping method, was developed for identification of the strain of IBV present in field samples based on nucleotide variations within the gene encoding the S1 subunit of the surface spike (S) glycoprotein. This method was developed to provide a tool to inform vaccination decisions and for ongoing surveillance to detect new and emerging strains of IBV within the UK. The performance of the test was evaluated using laboratory isolates of IBV and field samples.

Rapid and accurate detection of respiratory viruses is crucial for appropriate patient treatment and prevention of endemic spread. OBJECTIVES: We compared two multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the detection of respiratory viral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 245 respiratory specimens (229 sputum samples, 14 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, 6 nasal swabs, 3 throat swabs, 7 unknown) were analyzed using two multiplex assays: One\u2010step RV real\u2010time PCR (BioSewoom, Seoul, Korea) and Seeplex RV 12 Detection kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea). The results were further confirmed using sequencing as a reference. RESULTS: Among 245 samples (265 identifications including co\u2010infections), the identification of respiratory viruses was 44.9% (119/265), 44.2% (117/265) and 45.3% (120/265) by One\u2010step RV assay, Seeplex RV assay and sequencing, respectively. The concordance rate between One\u2010step RV assay and sequencing was 95.5% (253/265), and that between Seeplex RV assay and sequencing was 89.8% (238/265) (P = 0.0189). The sensitivities of One\u2010step RV and Seeplex RV assays were 94.1% [95% confidential interval (CI), 88.3%\u201397.6%] and 83.3% (95% CI, 75.4%\u201389.5%), respectively (P = 0.0002). The specificities of One\u2010step RV and Seeplex RV assays were 96.6% (95% CI, 92.2%\u201398.9%) and 95.2% (95% CI, 90.3%\u201398.0%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Although the performances of One\u2010step RV and Seeplex RV assays were overall comparable, One\u2010step RV assay showed better sensitivity and concordance with sequencing. One\u2010step RV assay can be a useful option for respiratory virus testing in clinical laboratories.","publish_time":"2014-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Hanah; Hur, Mina; Moon, Hee\u2010Won; Yun, Yeo\u2010Min; Cho, Hyun Chan","journal":"Clin Respir J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e9a2f6f32bb7e726b0d0cb1b61b44870e8a1846.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162222.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.12083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24308853/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszOTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Rapid","Seeplex RV"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["One\u2010step RV assay","Seeplex RV assays","performances of One\u2010step RV","sensitivities of One\u2010step RV","specificities of One\u2010step RV","One\u2010step RV real\u2010time PCR","sequencing","respiratory specimens","identification of respiratory viruses","multiplex assays","accurate detection of respiratory viruses","respiratory virus testing","detection of respiratory viral pathogens","lower respiratory tract diseases","sputum samples","Detection kit","Seoul","Korea","results","bronchoalveolar lavage samples","nasal swabs","throat swabs","concordance rate","multiplex polymerase chain reaction","appropriate patient treatment","main causes of upper","useful option","better sensitivity","BioSewoom","Seegene","prevention of endemic spread","clinical laboratories","co\u2010infections","identifications","total","INTRODUCTION","OBJECTIVES","confidential interval","METHODS","CONCLUSION","reference"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES: hRSV was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in NPAs taken upon admission to hospital and, whenever possible, at discharge and subsequent medical visits. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study, including 63 infants affected by either hRSV upper or lower ARTI. RESULTS: Based on the kinetics of viral load, hRSV etiology was identified in 25 infants in whom hRSV load dropped from 2.5 \u00D7 10(6) upon admission (presence of respiratory symptoms) to 7.5 \u00D7 10(2) RNA copies/ml NPA upon discharge (absence of symptoms) after a median time of 5 days, and in 19 infants, in whom hRSV load was determined at admission only, in association with clinical symptoms (2.4 \u00D7 10(6) copies/ml). Furthermore, low levels of hRSV RNA (\u003C1 \u00D7 10(5) copies/ml NPA) identified 14 patients with non-hRSV ARTI. Finally, in 14 infants with hRSV coinfections or sequential infections, hRSV quantification defined the hRSV role in the current ARTI episode.

The epicenters of these outbreaks have differed, and could be linked to different economic contexts. Arguably, the responses to these outbreaks have been \u201Cpolitical\u201D and inherently burdensome to marginalized populations. Key lessons can be learned from exploring the narratives about the different epidemics in varying income settings. Based on a review of the published medical, social, and political literature, which was accessed using four electronic databases\u2014PubMed, Sociological Abstracts, Scholars Portal, and Web of Science, the overall objective of this paper discuss scholars\u2019 narratives on the \u201Cpolitics\u201D of Ebola in a low-income setting, Zika virus in a middle-income setting, and SARS in a high-income setting. Various themes of the politics of epidemics were prominent in the literature. The narratives demonstrated the influence of power in whose narratives and what narratives are presented in the literature. While marginalized populations were reported to have borne the brunt of all disease outbreaks in the different contexts, the prevalence of their narratives within the reviewed literature was limited. Regardless of income setting, there is a need to give voice to the most marginalized communities during an epidemic. The experiences and narratives of those most vulnerable to an epidemic\u2014specifically poor communities\u2014need to be represented in the literature. This could contribute to mitigating some of the negative impact of the politics in epidemics.","publish_time":"2018-09-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kapiriri, Lydia; Ross, Alison","journal":"Glob Soc Welf","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100305.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40609-018-0123-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226719/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs0ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["scholars\u2019 narratives","political literature","politics of epidemics","different epidemics","disease outbreaks","reviewed literature","low-income setting","middle-income setting","different contexts","high-income setting","marginalized communities","marginalized populations","different economic contexts","need","poor communities","varying income settings","Sociological Abstracts","PubMed","Scholars Portal","Web of Science","overall objective","Zika virus","published medical","electronic databases","paper","Ebola","SARS","prevalence","influence of power","past","decades","Various themes","negative impact","voice","experiences","brunt","Key lessons","epicenters","responses"],"language":"en"},

All newly-identified betacoronaviruses were SARS-related Rhinolophus bat coronaviruses (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV). Importantly, with the exception of the S gene, the genome sequences of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoVs sampled in Guizhou province were closely related to SARS-related human coronavirus. Additionally, the newly-identified alphacoronaviruses exhibited high genetic diversity and some may represent novel species. Our phylogenetic analyses also provided insights into the transmission of these viruses among bat species, revealing a general clustering by geographic location rather than by bat species. Inter-species transmission among bats from the same genus was also commonplace in both the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses. Overall, these data suggest that high contact rates among specific bat species enable the acquisition and spread of coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Xian-Dan; Wang, Wen; Hao, Zong-Yu; Wang, Zhao-Xiao; Guo, Wen-Ping; Guan, Xiao-Qing; Wang, Miao-Ruo; Wang, Hong-Wei; Zhou, Run-Hong; Li, Ming-Hui; Tang, Guang-Peng; Wu, Jun; Holmes, Edward C.; Zhang, Yong-Zhen","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f6fac5e86a7b2905e078004092fefce1acb4bfb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111643.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217301009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217301009; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.03.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28384506/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Guizhou"],"keyphrases":["specific bat species","novel species","evolution of bat coronaviruses","SARS-related Rhinolophus bat coronaviruses","Inter-species transmission","bats","betacoronaviruses","alphacoronaviruses","SARSr-Rh","SARS-related human coronavirus","high genetic diversity","overall prevalence","high contact rates","genome sequences","general clustering","geographic location","S gene","insights","BatCoVs","Guizhou province","acquisition","data","genus","phylogenetic analyses","exception","total","China"],"language":"en"},

Results: The situation was quickly controlled after the implementation of these procedures. The central argument in this case is that crisis managerial behavior is the result of how managers channel and distribute the attention of their crisis sense.

Recombinant viruses were detected at high frequency when infection by the two different ts mutants was separated by as much as 24 h, suggesting that superinfection exclusion does not play a role in reovirus mixed infections.

Abstract Within the context of the SARS-Cov-2 virus epidemic, the Ambulatory Care Unit of the Toulouse University Hospital Center, offering institutional psychotherapeutic care to people with severe and/or disabling psychiatric pathologies, closed its doors to patients on the 16th of March 2020. This article aims to document the necessary adjustments to the care setting during this extraordinary period. As it was, the team had to tell patients to stay at home and to respect rules of social distancing. An inescapable paradox when our work consists precisely in de-confining, connecting, being in contact with each other. Face-to-face meetings, group workshops, the array of our mediations were suspended; the challenge for us was to bring to light what is irreducible or essential in the institutional psychotherapeutic care for psychoses, what must remain active through the confinement. These modifications of the psychotherapeutic setting will be described in terms of constructing a virtual mental institution, based on a setting twisted by the distance but not abolished, telephone consultations opening up to a speculative but not disembodied psychopathological imaginary, and finally a blog as a quasi-materialization of a virtual space. This experience led the team of the Ambulatory Care Unit to radicalize the institution to keep it in its simplest apparatus: a virtual tree structure of the mental institution. The prior interactions between caregivers and patients have been translated (and thus re-created) virtually. As to respect their singular aspects, as well as their fundamental belonging to the collective that supports our institution. This virtual mental institution can therefore maintain the framework that structures our institutional care project, and can link the before and what will be the after of the confinement. For this study, we have conducted an \u0022on-the-spot\u0022 analysis of the concrete arrangements of our therapeutic setting from an interdisciplinary perspective: phenomenological, systemic and psychodynamic.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Brouwer, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Faure, Karine; Goz\u00E9, Tudi","journal":"Annales M\u00E9dico-psychologiques, revue psychiatrique","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19e0610ae5c3fc5ff3bb8b571a9ea76d54090fd2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003448720301591?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.05.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003448720301591","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["l\u2019\u00E9quipe"],"organizations":["Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse"],"locations":["us"],"keyphrases":["the SARS","the challenge","the array","the-spot","the mental institution","the Ambulatory Care","the distance but","the concrete arrangements","Face-to","can link the before","essential in the institutional psychotherapeutic care","Abstract Within the context","to radicalize the institution to keep it in its simplest apparatus","This experience led the team","This article aims to document the necessary adjustments to the care setting during this extraordinary period","the team had to tell patients to stay at home","what will be the after","the Toulouse University Hospital Center","The prior interactions between caregivers","to respect rules","as well as their fundamental belonging to the collective that supports our institution","the psychotherapeutic setting will be described in terms","what must remain active through the confinement","closed its doors to patients","institution mentale virtuelle","This virtual mental institution can therefore maintain the framework that structures our institutional care project","us was to bring to light what is irreducible","As to respect their singular aspects","offering institutional psychotherapeutic care to people with severe","cadre de soin","blog as","As it was","this study","modifications du cadre","setting twisted","virtual space","cadre tordu","virtual tree structure","Unit\u00E9 de Soins Ambulatoires","soin psychoth\u00E9rapique institutionnel","projet de soin institutionnel","our therapeutic setting from an interdisciplinary perspective","An inescapable paradox when our work consists precisely in","our mediations were suspended","psychoses","being in contact with each other","conducted an","Cov","arborescence virtuelle","\u00E9quipe","effet","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie du virus SARS","soins psychoth\u00E9rapiques institutionnels","speculative but","or disabling psychiatric pathologies","consultations t\u00E9l\u00E9phoniques","virus epidemic","quasi-mat\u00E9rialisation","face meetings","objet-blog","These modifications","am\u00E9nagements concrets","am\u00E9nagements n\u00E9cessaires","telephone consultations opening","pathologies psychiatriques s\u00E9v\u00E8res","constructing","confining","connecting","abolished","group workshops","phenomenological","based","disembodied psychopathological imaginary","translated","personnes","finally","analysis","ateliers collectifs","regards crois\u00E9s","Centre Hospitalier Universitaire","pr\u00E9sence","m\u00E9diations suspendus","dispositif th\u00E9rapeutique","systemic","\u00E9dification","materialization","thus re","social distancing","created","contexte","termes","travail","virtually","psychodynamique","Rencontres","enjeu","psychodynamic","vif","espace virtuel","simple appareil","p\u00E9riode extraordinaire","tenants","March","r\u00E8gles de distanciation sociale","analyse","Paradoxe incontournable","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","portes","lien","soignants","faire","exp\u00E9rience"],"language":"fr"},

However, it is not the only threat. On 30 November 2013, a human H10N8 infection case was first described in China. The origin and genetic diversity of this novel virus is similar to that of H7N9 virus. As H10N8 avian influenza virus (AIV) was first identified from a duck in Guangdong Province during 2012 and there is also evidence of H10N8 infected dogs in this region, we sought to examine archived sera from animal workers to see if there was evidence of subclinical human infections before the first human H10N8 cases. METHODS: We studied archived serum samples (cross-sectional study, convenience sample) collected between May and September 2013 from 710 animal workers and 107 non-animal exposed volunteers living in five cities of Guangdong Province. Study participants\u2019 sera were tested by horse red blood cells (RBCs) hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays according to World Health Organization guidelines. The A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346-1/2013(H10N8) virus was used. Sera which have an HI assay \u22651:20 were further tested with the MN assay. Questionnaire data were examined for risk factor associations with positive serological assays. Risk factor analyses failed to identify specific factors associated with probable H10N8 infections. RESULTS: Among the 827 sera, only 21 animal workers had an HI titer \u22651:20 (18 had an HI titer of 1:20 and 3 had an HI titer of 1:40). None of these 21 subjects reported experiencing any influenza symptoms during the three months before enrollment. Among the three subjects with HI titers of 1:40, two had MN antibody titers of 1:40, and one had a MN antibody titer of 1:80 (probable H10N8 infections). CONCLUSIONS: Study data suggest that animal workers may have been infected with the H10N8 virus before the first recognized H10N8 human infection cases. It seems prudent to continue surveillance for H10N8 viruses among animal workers.","publish_time":"2014-10-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qi, Wenbao; Su, Shuo; Xiao, Chencheng; Zhou, Pei; Li, Huanan; Ke, Changwen; Gray, Gregory C; Zhang, Guihong; Liao, Ming","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0f36613dbfcdb38aee79337d0a011c8760acba0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4219099.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-014-0205-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25348464/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China","Guangdong"],"keyphrases":["human H10N8 cases","animal workers","H10N8 viruses","probable H10N8 infections","H10N8 avian influenza virus","human H10N8 infection case","recognized H10N8 human infection cases","H7N9 virus","HI titers","HI assay","evidence of H10N8 infected dogs","novel virus","evidence of subclinical human infections","archived sera","MN assay","Study participants\u2019 sera","MN antibody titers","increasing number of human H7N9 infections","Study data","epicenter of pandemic influenza virus generation","non-animal exposed volunteers","cross-sectional study","influenza symptoms","subjects","risk factor associations","Risk factor analyses","cities of Guangdong Province","southern China","Questionnaire data","archived serum samples","positive serological assays","RBCs","horse red blood cells","hemagglutination inhibition","specific factors","microneutralization","surveillance","convenience sample","World Health Organization guidelines","genetic diversity","region","AIV","origin","METHODS","months","CONCLUSIONS","enrollment","BACKGROUND","duck","Jiangxi-Donghu","RESULTS","threat"],"language":"en"},

Here, we analyzed the effects of the plant compound silvestrol, a specific inhibitor of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, on viral translation using a dual luciferase assay and virus-infected primary cells. Silvestrol was recently shown to have potent antiviral activity in Ebola virus-infected human macrophages. We found that silvestrol is also a potent inhibitor of cap-dependent viral mRNA translation in CoV-infected human embryonic lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells. EC50 values of 1.3 nM and 3 nM silvestrol were determined for MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, respectively. For the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, the potent antiviral activities of silvestrol were also confirmed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a second type of human primary cells. Silvestrol strongly inhibits the expression of CoV structural and nonstructural proteins (N, nsp8) and the formation of viral replication/transcription complexes. Furthermore, potential antiviral effects against human rhinovirus (HRV) A1 and poliovirus type 1 (PV), representing different species in the genus Enterovirus (family Picornaviridae), were investigated. The two viruses employ an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-mediated translation initiation mechanism. For PV, which is known to require the activity of eIF4A, an EC50 value of 20 nM silvestrol was determined in MRC-5 cells. The higher EC50 value of 100 nM measured for HRV A1 indicates a less critical role of eIF4A activity in HRV A1 IRES-mediated translation initiation. Taken together, the data reveal a broad-spectrum antiviral activity of silvestrol in infected primary cells by inhibiting eIF4A-dependent viral mRNA translation.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FCller, Christin; Schulte, Falk W.; Lange-Gr\u00FCnweller, Kerstin; Obermann, Wiebke; Madhugiri, Ramakanth; Pleschka, Stephan; Ziebuhr, John; Hartmann, Roland K.; Gr\u00FCnweller, Arnold","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0a747c6e7bcbba0cf55a4924cc16dfda463dbb9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113723.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29258862/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354217306381; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2017.12.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354217306381","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":["Ebola"],"keyphrases":["nM silvestrol","viral translation","viral mRNA translation initiation","broad-spectrum antiviral activity of silvestrol","eIF4A-dependent viral mRNA translation","activity of eIF4A","potent antiviral activities of silvestrol","virus-infected primary cells","type of human primary cells","potent antiviral activity","plant compound silvestrol","HRV A1 IRES-mediated translation initiation","cap-dependent","mediated translation initiation mechanism","CoV-infected human embryonic lung fibroblast","potent inhibitor of cap","pathogenic MERS-CoV","human rhinovirus","critical role of eIF4A activity","Ebola virus-infected human macrophages","formation of viral replication","expression of CoV structural","potential antiviral effects","peripheral blood mononuclear cells","MRC","higher EC50 value","EC50 values","PV","DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A","cap-independent strategies","strand RNA viruses","specific inhibitor","poliovirus type","dual luciferase assay","nonstructural proteins","picornaviruses","internal ribosomal entry site","genus Enterovirus","nsp8","PBMCs","different species","transcription complexes","family Picornaviridae","Abstract Coronaviruses","HCoV","data"],"language":"en"},

Methods In this prospective descriptive study, 15 confirmed hospitalized cases of COVID-19 between 18th March and April 7, 2020 were followed-up till discharge. Results There were 15 reported patients infected by 3 imported index cases from Europe. The mean age of the patients was 28.06 (SD: 16.42 years). The patients\u0027 age stratification was as follows: 0\u20135 (2, 13.3%); 6\u201318 (2, 13.3); 19\u201350 (10, 66.7%), and 51\u201364 years (1, 6.7%). The patients were male (9, 60.0%) and female (6, 40.0%). Most of the patients had mild disease severity (13, 86.7%), followed by mild-moderate (1, 6.7%) and moderate-severe (1, 6.7%). The study revealed that 6 patients were asymptomatic, and 9 patients were symptomatic. The most common symptoms were: fever (n = 8; 53.3%), cough (n = 7; 46.7%), shortness of breath (n = 3; 20.0%), fatigue (n = 3; 20.0%), and taste and smell disorders (n = 4; 26.7%). All patients were recovered and discharged over a median of 8 between 8 and 21 days. The mean and Std. deviation values of the hematological were: WBC: 6.57 (1.86); neutrophil count: 3.75 (1.26); lymphocyte count: 1.87 (0.41); Hb: 13.89 (1.26); platelet count: 207.67 (52.21). Conclusion All COVID-19 cases were linked to foreign visits with few local transmissions to close contacts without community transmission. The majority of cases were mild illnesses with full recovery.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Merza, Muayad A.; Haleem Al Mezori, Azad A.; Mohammed, Hakar Mustafa; Abdulah, Deldar Morad","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a53a64b67cc273a3c9eaf931c7e6f36eda7521e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199697.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402120301120; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408119/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402120301120?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["reported patients","confirmed hospitalized cases of COVID","majority of cases","mild-moderate","coronavirus disease","mild disease severity","imported index cases","radiological characteristics of COVID","mild illnesses","mean age","neutrophil count","lymphocyte count","platelet count","years","novel coronavirus","moderate-severe","prospective descriptive study","patients\u0027 age stratification","local transmissions","close contacts","laboratory","community transmission","foreign visits","deviation values","global pandemic","Methods","Europe","common symptoms","fever","taste","smell disorders","recovery","WBC","shortness of breath","Results","SD","Conclusion","Abstract Introduction","female","objectives","cough","fatigue","discharge","median","days","Hb"],"language":"en"},

Thus, \u22121 PRF presents a novel target for antiviral therapeutics. The underlying molecular mechanism of \u22121 PRF is conserved from yeast to mammals, enabling yeast to be used as a logical platform for high-throughput screens.

Hypothesis: The aim was to describe patterns of mortality in life\u2010insured Swedish cats. Cats: All cats (\u003C13 years of age) with life insurance during the period 1999\u20132006 were included. Methods: Age\u2010standardized mortality rates (MR) were calculated with respect to sex (males and females), age, breed, and diagnosis. Survival to various ages is presented by time period and breed. Results: The total number of cats insured was 49,450 and the number of cat\u2010years at risk (CYAR) was 142,049. During the period, 6,491 cats died and of these 4,591 cats (71%) had a diagnosis, ie, were claimed for life insurance. The average annual MR was 462 deaths per 10,000 CYAR (95% confidence interval, 431\u2013493). Sex\u2010specific rates did not differ significantly. The overall mortality of the Persian and the Siamese groups was higher than that of several other breeds. Overall and breed\u2010specific (for most breeds) survival increased with time when analyzed by 2\u2010year periods. The 6 most common diagnostic categories (ignoring cats recorded as dead with no diagnosis) were urinary, traumatic, neoplastic, infectious, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal. The MR within diagnostic categories varied by age and breed. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: In this mainly purebred, insured cat population, the overall mortality varied with age and breed but not with sex. The increase in survival over time is likely a reflection of willingness to keep pet cats longer and increased access to and sophistication of veterinary care.","publish_time":"2009-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Egenvall, A.; N\u00F8dtvedt, A.; H\u00E4ggstr\u00F6m, J.; Str\u00F6m Holst, B.; M\u00F6ller, L.; Bonnett, B.N.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5d4ec88a2777c8f8f13ec64f246a4adca8428bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167180.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1939-1676.2009.0396.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19780926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Persian"],"keyphrases":["pet cats","insured Swedish cats","overall mortality","years of age","total number of cats insured","patterns of mortality","feline mortality","time period","Survival","sex","diagnosis","cat life insurance database","standardized mortality rates","insured cat population","CYAR","specific rates","breeds","average annual MR","common diagnostic categories","increased access","reflection of willingness","Persian","females","deaths","respect","risk","various ages","Background","dead","Methods","sophistication of veterinary care","Siamese groups","Clinical Importance","aim","Results","Conclusions","confidence interval","year periods","Hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

However, privacy concerns often prevent multiple competitive organizations from sharing and integrating their patient training videos. In addition, patients with infectious or chronic diseases may not want the online patient training organizations to identify who they are or even which video clips they are interested in. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective techniques to protect both video content privacy and access privacy. In this paper, we have developed a new approach to construct a distributed Hippocratic video database system for supporting more profitable online patient training and counseling. First, a new database modeling approach is developed to support concept-oriented video database organization and assign a degree of privacy of the video content for each database level automatically. Second, a new algorithm is developed to protect the video content privacy at the level of individual video clip by filtering out the privacy-sensitive human objects automatically. In order to integrate the patient training videos from multiple competitive organizations for constructing a centralized video database indexing structure, a privacy-preserving video sharing scheme is developed to support privacy-preserving distributed classifier training and prevent the statistical inferences from the videos that are shared for cross-validation of video classifiers. Our experiments on large-scale video databases have also provided very convincing results.","publish_time":"2009-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Jinye; Babaguchi, Noboru; Luo, Hangzai; Gao, Yuli; Fan, Jianping","journal":"IEEE Trans Inf Technol Biomed","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b55a75f033e1f57939f21d0d4b6a20be9d20d1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176470.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/titb.2009.2029695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19726265/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Digital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["video content privacy","video classifiers","Digital video","video clips","online patient training organizations","video sharing scheme","large-scale video databases","profitable online patient training","degree of privacy","integration of patient training videos","privacy concerns","access privacy","distributed Hippocratic video database system","centralized video database indexing structure","concept-oriented video database organization","level of individual video clip","database level","multiple competitive organizations","distributed classifier training","privacy-sensitive human objects","new database modeling approach","new approach","counseling","patients","new algorithm","health care network","effective techniques","important role","chronic diseases","better offerings","statistical inferences","cross-validation","urgent need","addition","experiments","order","convincing results","paper"],"language":"en"},

Coding and non-coding RNAs frequently fold into complex conformations which, if effectively targeted, offer opportunities to therapeutically modulate numerous cellular processes, including those linked to undruggable protein targets. Despite the considerable skepticism as to whether RNAs can be targeted with small molecule therapeutics, overwhelming evidence suggests the challenges we are currently facing are not outside the realm of possibility. In this review, we highlight the most recent advances in molecular techniques that have sparked a revolution in understanding the RNA structure-to-function relationship. We bring attention to the application of these modern techniques to identify druggable RNA targets and to assess small molecule binding specificity. Finally, we discuss novel screening methodologies that support RNA drug discovery and present examples of therapeutically valuable RNA targets.","publish_time":"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sztuba-Solinska, Joanna; Chavez-Calvillo, Gabriela; Cline, Sabrina Elizabeth","journal":"Bioorganic \u0026 Medicinal Chemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/11169e2c3b6609342e20ae192e7a59e01b48d5ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126819.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981606/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2019.03.057; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968089618321084; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089618321084","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["valuable RNA targets","druggable RNA targets","RNA structure","RNA drug discovery","non-coding RNAs","attractive therapeutic targets","undruggable protein targets","crucial roles of RNAs","small molecule therapeutics","modern techniques","small molecule binding specificity","molecular techniques","non-infectious human diseases","present examples","overwhelming evidence","novel screening methodologies","revolution","increasing appreciation","recent advances","complex conformations","numerous cellular processes","opportunities","challenges","application","function relationship","attention","considerable skepticism","realm of possibility","review"],"language":"en"},

Since then, human cases have been accumulating. Given the public health importance of this virus, we performed a pathogenicity study of the H7N9 virus in the cynomolgus macaque model, focusing on clinical aspects of disease, radiographic, histological, and gene expression profile changes in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and changes in systemic cytokine and chemokine profiles during infection. Cynomolgus macaques developed transient, mild to severe disease with radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltration. Virus replicated in the upper as well as lower respiratory tract, with sustained replication in the upper respiratory tract until the end of the experiment at 6 days after inoculation. Virus shedding occurred mainly via the throat. Histopathological changes in the lungs were similar to those observed in humans, albeit less severe, with diffuse alveolar damage, infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, formation of hyaline membranes, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and fibroproliferative changes. Analysis of gene expression profiles in lung lesions identified pathways involved in tissue damage during H7N9 infection as well as leads for development of therapeutics targeting host responses rather than virus replication. Overall, H7N9 infection was not as severe in cynomolgus macaques as in humans, supporting the possible role of underlying medical complications in disease severity as discussed for human H7N9 infection (H.

Here, using genetic and chemical tools to probe functions of the S1P(1) receptor, we elucidate cellular and signaling mechanisms important in initiating cytokine storm. While S1P(1) receptor is expressed on endothelial cells and lymphocytes within lung tissue, S1P(1) agonism suppresses cytokines and innate immune cell recruitment in wild-type and lymphocyte deficient mice, identifying endothelial cells as central regulators of cytokine storm. Furthermore, our data reveal immune cell infiltration and cytokine production as distinct events both orchestrated by endothelial cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that suppression of early innate immune responses through S1P(1) signaling results in reduced mortality during infection with a human pathogenic strain of influenza virus.

Methods: Tumours were induced by injecting cells from the R3230AC rat mammary tumour cell line clone D subcutaneously, in 28 female Fischer 344 rats. EChT was conducted by inserting a platinum electrode into the tumours. The positive and negative control groups were subjected to the same conditions but without current. The rats were kept for 0, 7 or 14 days post-treatment. Three hours prior to euthanasia an i.p. injection of Bromodioxyuridine (BrdU) was given. The rats were euthanized, the lesions extirpated and samples were collected for histopathological, and immunohistochemical examination. Results: Significant changes in cell proliferation rate were seen both in the cathode and anode regions. Apoptosis were induced in the anodic treated area outside the primary necrosis, detected with the TUNEL method. Discussion: The results suggest that secondary cell destruction was caused by necrosis with cathodic EChT and apoptosis or necrosis with anodic EChT.","publish_time":"2003-12-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"von Euler, H; Str\u00E5hle, K; Th\u00F6rne, A; Yongqing, G","journal":"Bioelectrochemistry","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1d13983504af878766bcd98fb793c283e7ab567.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129577.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567539403001245; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567539403001245","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fischer"],"organizations":["TUNEL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effectiveness of EChT","rats","primary necrosis","encouraging results","Apoptosis","malignant tumours","cell proliferation rate","secondary cell destruction","Significant changes","Electrochemical treatment","toxic changes","R3230AC rat mammary tumour cell line clone D","animal tumour model","anodic treated area","days post-treatment","cells","injection of Bromodioxyuridine","female Fischer","negative control groups","euthanasia","cathode","authors","TUNEL method","platinum electrode","conditions","immunohistochemical examination","anode regions","samples","hours","BrdU","lesions","Discussion","Background","studies","Methods","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

The Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because, in contrast to the \u201Cclassic\u201D flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(\u002B) genome. Two segments of the JMTV genome have homology with regions of the flavivirus genome encoding polymerase and helicase-protease proteins. JMTVs have several open reading frames (ORF) in segments encoding glycoprotein(s) and capsid protein and these ORF are specific only to them. JMTVs greatly differ in virion size. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMTV group, from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMTV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream ORF in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the JMTV group. We isolated three strains of Alongshan virus (ALSV) from adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks from two geographically separate areas of Russia in the Ixodes ricinus tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. The majority of virions of the ALSV strain Miass527 were enveloped spherical particles with a diameter of 40.5\u00B13.7 nm.

PALS1, a tight junction-associated protein, is a member of the CRUMBS3-PALS1-PATJ polarity complex, which is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of epithelial polarity in mammals. Here we report that the carboxy-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV E small envelope protein (E) binds to human PALS1. Using coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, we show that E interacts with PALS1 in mammalian cells and further demonstrate that the last four carboxy-terminal amino acids of E form a novel PDZ-binding motif that binds to PALS1 PDZ domain. PALS1 redistributes to the ERGIC/Golgi region, where E accumulates, in SARS-CoV\u2013infected Vero E6 cells. Ectopic expression of E in MDCKII epithelial cells significantly alters cyst morphogenesis and, furthermore, delays formation of tight junctions, affects polarity, and modifies the subcellular distribution of PALS1, in a PDZ-binding motif-dependent manner.

In this study, eight A (H1N1)pdm 2009 seropositive patients within the age range of 20-50 years (median=36 years) were recruited. Two anti-HA mAbs secreting stable clones, 2D8 and 2F12 were established under optimized conditions from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the volunteers. These antibodies efficiently neutralized the homologous laboratory isolated strain of the pandemic virus as well as the reference strain. Our study suggests that the anti-HA antibodies derived from infected Indian patients display neutralization potential against the A(H1N1)pdm 2009 virus. This is the first ever study of generation of mAbs against the pandemic influenza virus involving the immune repertoire if Indian patients.

Silver nanoparticle (Agnano) coatings on filtration membranes can prevent bacterial adhesion and the initiation of biofilm formation. In this study, Agnano are immobilized via direct reduction on porous zirconia capillary membranes to generate a nanocomposite material combining the advantages of ceramics being chemically, thermally and mechanically stable with nanosilver, an efficient broadband bactericide for water decontamination. The filtration of bacterial suspensions of the fecal contaminant Escherichia coli reveals highly efficient bacterial retention capacities of the capillaries of 8 log reduction values, fulfilling the requirements on safe drinking water according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

To overcome those issues, for the first time, authors presented a novel parallel structural dsDNA/recombinant azurin (PSD/rAzu) hybrid structure for the general nucleic acid detection. The PSD was designed and introduced by the optimized 8 Ag\u002B ions to have greater conductivity than the canonical dsDNA, and conjugated with rAzu to develop a general platform for electrochemical detection of miRNAs and viral DNAs with high reproducibility and ultra-sensitivity towards single base pair mutation. Thanks to the bifunctional rAzu as the selective spacer and electrochemical signal mediator, in the presence of the target strand, the imperfect PSD switched rapidly to the upright position where the Ag\u002B ions intercalated between C-C mismatches of dsDNAs at the top of each structure brought further from the electrode surface resulting in a significant electrochemical signal drop of the Ag\u002B ions. The charge transfer (CT) mechanism across the hybrid structure was simply clarified on the basis of the redox potential location of the species. The electrical conductivity of DNAs were measured using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) at the molecular scale and cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique based on the reduction of Ag\u002B ion. The proposed PSD/rAzu hybrid structure with a great capability of single mutation recognition and miRNA expression level profiling in cancer cells holds a very promising platform to be studied for further development of various kinds of nanoscale biosensors, bioelectronic devices.","publish_time":"2017-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohammadniaei, Mohsen; Lee, Taek; Yoon, Jinho; Lee, Donghyun; Choi, Jeong-Woo","journal":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83db37721c6caed93bb45a46f45bfe99701fb3ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125781.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566317304554; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.07.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28697440/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566317304554","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PSD","Ag"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rAzu hybrid structure","ions","bifunctional rAzu","reduction of Ag","imperfect PSD","proposed PSD","single mismatch detection","electrochemical detection of miRNAs","general nucleic acid detection","electrochemical signal mediator","general platform","molecular-level nucleic acid biosensor","single base pair mutation","significant electrochemical signal drop","electrical conductivity of DNAs","great capability of single mutation recognition","viral DNAs","electrode surface","molecular scale","canonical dsDNA","C-C mismatches of dsDNAs","greater conductivity","promising platform","surface immobilization control","miRNA expression level profiling","novel parallel structural dsDNA","ultra-sensitivity","high reproducibility","recombinant azurin","cancer cells","CV","selective spacer","development of various kinds of nanoscale biosensors","low current response","cyclic voltammetry","authors","technique","presence","mechanism","bioelectronic devices","upright position","redox potential location","time","STS","basis","target strand","scanning","spectroscopy","species","charge transfer","Thanks","issues","challenges"],"language":"en"},

We retrospectively evaluated the use of recent, short, historical time-series for recognizing the onset of community outbreaks of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). METHODS: The data used referred to the proportion of diagnoses for upper or lower RTIs to total diagnoses for house-call visits, performed by a private network of medical specialists (SOS Doctors) in the metropolitan area of Athens, Greece, between January 01, 2000 and October 12, 2008. The reference standard classification of the observations was obtained by generating epidemic thresholds after analyzing the full 9-year period. We evaluated two different alert generating methods [simple regression and cumulative sum (CUSUM), respectively], under a range of input parameters, using data for the previous running 4\u20136 week period. These methods were applied if the previous weeks contained non-aberrant observations. RESULTS: We found that the CUSUM model with a specific set of parameters performed marginally better than simple regression for both groups. The best results (sensitivity, specificity) for simple regression and CUSUM models for upper RTIs were (1.00, 0.82) and (0.94, 0.93) respectively. Corresponding results for lower RTIs were (1.00, 0.80) and (0.93, 0.91) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term data for house-call visits can be used rather reliably to identify respiratory tract outbreaks in the community using simple regression and CUSUM methods. Such surveillance models could be particularly useful when a large historical database is either unavailable or inaccurate and, thus, traditional methods are not optimal.","publish_time":"2012-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Spanos, Alex; Theocharis, George; Karageorgopoulos, Drosos E.; Peppas, George; Fouskakis, Dimitris; Falagas, Matthew E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8a2d2e38286fa86dcf60a8a1b0b95658f2d70850.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3414488.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22905091/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0040310","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Athens","Greece"],"keyphrases":["CUSUM methods","simple regression","traditional methods","upper RTIs","lower RTIs","CUSUM models","historical time-series","respiratory tract outbreaks","house","visits","Short-term data","surveillance models","best results","Corresponding results","onset of community outbreaks of respiratory tract infections","large historical database","total diagnoses","previous weeks","illness surveillance","previous running","proportion of diagnoses","week period","year period","specific set of parameters","non-aberrant observations","range of input parameters","traditional Serfling-type approach","SOS Doctors","influenza","specificity","private network of medical specialists","sensitivity","cumulative sum","metropolitan area of Athens","different alert","use of recent","Greece","reference standard classification","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","groups","epidemic thresholds"],"language":"en"},

Investigations upon genetic susceptibility profile to systemic complications during severe infections are a field of increasing scientific interest. Particularly when adaptive immune system is compromised or immature, innate immunity plays a key role in the immediate defense against invasive pathogens. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a serum protein that recognizes a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms and activates complement cascade via the antibody-independent pathway. More than 30% of humans harbor mutations in MBL gene (MBL2) resulting in reduced plasmatic levels and activity. Increased risk of infection acquisition has been largely documented in MBL-deficient patients, but the real impact of this form of innate immunosuppression upon clinical outcome is not clear. In critically ill patients higher incidence and worse prognosis of severe sepsis/septic shock appear to be associated with low-producers haplotypes. However an excess of MBL activation might be also harmful due to the possibility of an unbalanced proinflammatory response and an additional host injury.

Neutralizing antibodies from individuals who have recovered from an infection confer therapeutic protection to others infected with the same pathogen. However, survivors may not always be available for providing plasma or for the cloning of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The genome and the immunoglobulin genes in rhesus macaques and humans are highly homologous; therefore, we investigated whether neutralizing mAbs that are highly homologous to those of humans (human-like) could be generated. Using the H5N1 influenza virus as a model, we first immunized rhesus macaques with recombinant adenoviruses carrying a synthetic gene encoding hemagglutinin (HA). Following screening an antibody phage display library derived from the B cells of immunized monkeys, we cloned selected macaque immunoglobulin heavy chain and light chain variable regions into the human IgG constant region, which generated human-macaque chimeric mAbs exhibiting over 97% homology to human antibodies. Selected mAbs demonstrated potent neutralizing activities against three clades (0, 1, 2) of the H5N1 influenza viruses. The in vivo protection experiments demonstrated that the mAbs effectively protected the mice even when administered up to 3 days after infection with H5N1 influenza virus. In particular, mAb 4E6 demonstrated sub-picomolar binding affinity to HA and superior in vivo protection efficacy without the loss of body weight and obvious lung damage. The analysis of the 4E6 escape mutants demonstrated that the 4E6 antibody bound to a conserved epitope region containing two amino acids on the globular head of HA. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrated the generation of neutralizing mAbs for potential application in humans in urgent preparedness against outbreaks of new influenza infections or other virulent infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2013-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meng, Weixu; Pan, Weiqi; Zhang, Anna J.

It appears that the promise of the \u201Cmagic bullet\u201D has largely been realized. There are currently 22 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use and hundreds are in clinical trials for treatment of various diseases including cancers, immune disorders, and infections. The revenues from the top five therapeutic antibodies (Rituxan, Remicade, Herceptin, Humira, and Avastin) nearly doubled from $6.4 billion in 2004 to $11.7 billion in 2006. During the last several years major pharmaceutical companies raced to acquire antibody companies, with a recent example of MedImmune being purchased for $15.6 billion by AstraZeneca. These therapeutic and business successes reflect the major advances in antibody engineering which have resulted in the generation of safe, specific, high-affinity, and non-immunogenic antibodies during the last three decades. Currently, second and third generations of antibodies are under development, mostly to improve already existing antibody specificities. However, although the refinement of already known methodologies is certainly of great importance for potential clinical use, there are no conceptually new developments in the last decade comparable, for example, to the development of antibody libraries, phage display, domain antibodies (dAbs), and antibody humanization to name a few. A fundamental question is then whether there will be another change in the paradigm of research as happened 1\u20132 decades ago or the current trend of gradual improvement of already developed methodologies and therapeutic antibodies will continue. Although any prediction could prove incorrect, it appears that conceptually new methodologies are needed to overcome the fundamental problems of drug (antibody) resistance due to genetic or/and epigenetic alterations in cancer and chronic infections, as well as problems related to access to targets and complexity of biological systems. If new methodologies are not developed, it is likely that gradual saturation will occur in the pipeline of conceptually new antibody therapeutics. In this scenario we will witness an increase in combination of targets and antibodies, and further attempts to personalize targeted treatments by using appropriate biomarkers as well as to develop novel scaffolds with properties that are superior to those of the antibodies now in clinical use.","publish_time":"2008-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Marks, James D.","journal":"Methods in Molecular Biology\u2122","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9a5a0e43d8efafa561961b2c6c74900517ef591.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a0c54b3cf708fa034c6b67e3b82ce7c5786cd4fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3402212.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19252861/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3402212?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-59745-554-1_1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["United States Food and Drug Administration","FDA","MedImmune","AstraZeneca"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["therapeutic antibodies","antibody companies","new antibody therapeutics","antibody engineering","antibody humanization","domain antibodies","monoclonal antibodies","generations of antibodies","new methodologies","development of antibody libraries","Antibody-based therapeutics","non-immunogenic antibodies","existing antibody specificities","potential clinical use","clinical trials","new developments","fundamental problems of drug","revenues","decades","Drug Administration","major advances","years major pharmaceutical companies","chronic infections","combination of targets","gradual saturation","paradigm of research","fundamental question","recent example of MedImmune","current trend of gradual improvement","FDA","phage display","treatment of various diseases","cancers","high-affinity","unprecedented success","dAbs","hundreds","United States Food","epigenetic alterations","immune disorders","Herceptin","growth","Rituxan","Remicade","great importance","pipeline","business successes","targeted treatments","generation of safe","Humira","access","mAbs","decade comparable","increase","attempts","resistance","complexity of biological systems","novel scaffolds","appropriate biomarkers","properties","recognition","promise","magic bullet","Avastin","change","prediction","scenario","refinement","AstraZeneca"],"language":"en"},

In recent years, NIRS has show promise as a useful monitoring technology to help detect relative tissue ischemia that could lead to significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. However, some issues inherent in NIRS technology use on neonates, such as wide fluctuation in signals, signal dropout and low limit of detection of the device, pose challenges that may obscure reliable interpretation of the NIRS measurements using current methods of analysis. In this paper, we propose new statistical methods to analyse mesenteric rSO2 (regional oxygenation) produced by NIRS to evaluate oxygenation in intestinal tissues and investigate oxygenation response to red blood cell transfusion (RBC) in preterm infants. We present a mean area under the curve (MAUC) measure and a slope measure to capture the mean rSO2 level and temporal trajectory of rSO2, respectively. Estimation methods are developed for these measures and nonparametric testing procedures are proposed to detect RBC-related changes in mesenteric oxygenation in preterm infants. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed methods demonstrate improved accuracy in characterizing the mean level and changing pattern of mesenteric rSO2 and also increased statistical power in detecting RBC-related changes, as compared with standard approaches. We apply our methods to a NIRS study in preterm infants receiving RBC transfusion from Emory Univerity to evaluate the pre- and post-transfusion mesenteric oxygenation in preterm infants.","publish_time":"2018-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Ying; Wang, Yikai; Marin, Terri; Kirk, Easley; Patel, Ravi M.; Josephson, Cassandra D.","journal":"Statistical methods in medical research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.08153v2.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29996701/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280218786302","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjsyNjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIRS","Emory Univerity"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preterm infants","regional oxygenation","RBC transfusion","post-transfusion mesenteric oxygenation","oxygenation response","NIRS measurements","NIRS study","proposed methods","pattern of mesenteric rSO2","mean rSO2 level","NIRS technology use","Estimation methods","RBC-related changes","new statistical methods","mean level","continuous evaluation of regional tissue oxygenation","current methods of analysis","temporal trajectory of rSO2","mean area","red blood cell transfusion","statistical power","slope measure","relative tissue ischemia","useful monitoring technology","signal dropout","low limit of detection","signals","promise","neonates","MAUC","Emory Univerity","wide fluctuation","significant morbidity","intestinal tissues","measures","improved accuracy","diagnostic tool","reliable interpretation","issues inherent","challenges","device","imaging","curve","mortality","nonparametric testing procedures","recent years","paper","standard approaches","infrared spectroscopy","simulation studies"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report major clinical and organisational challenges at a high-volume Italian IBD centre one month after the start of the Italian government\u0027s restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All routine follow-up IBD visits of patients in remission were cancelled or rescheduled for 8-12 weeks\u0027 time. However, access to the hospital for therapy or for unstable/relapsing patients was not considered postponable. Everyone attending the centre (e.g. physicians, nurses, administrative personnel and patients) were advised to respect the general recommended rules for hand hygiene and social distancing, to disclose if they had a fever or cough or flu-like symptoms and to wear a surgical mask and gloves. At the entrance of the therapy area, a control station was set up in order to double-check all patients with a clinical interview and conduct thermal scanning. A total of 1451 IBD patients under biotechnological or experimental therapy actively followed in the CEMAD IBD centre were included in the study. About 65% of patients maintained their appointment schedules without major problems, while in 20% of cases planned infusions were delayed because of the patient\u0027s decision or practical issues. About 10% of patients receiving subcutaneous therapy were allowed to collect their medicine without a follow-up visit. Finally, 10% of patients living outside the Lazio region requested access to their therapy at a local centre closer to their home. At present, five patients have been found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection but with minimal symptoms, 22 are in \u0027quarantine\u0027 for contact considered to be \u0027at risk\u0027 for the infection. Up to now, none of them has experienced significant symptoms.

Assessment of these devices under multiple experimental conditions will provide insight for device use. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to assess and compare bioaerosol sampling devices using a) an in vitro, environmentally\u2010controlled artificial bioaerosol system at a range of different RH conditions and b) an in vivo bioaerosol system of influenza virus\u2010infected ferrets under controlled environmental conditions. Secondarily, we also sought to examine the impact of NSAIDs on bioaerosol emission in influenza virus\u2010infected ferrets to address its potential as a determinant of bioaerosol emission. METHODS: We examined the performance of low and moderate volume bioaerosol samplers for the collection of viral RNA and infectious influenza virus in vitroand in vivo using artificial bioaerosols and the ferret model of influenza virus infection. The following samplers were tested: the polytetrafluoroethylene filter (PTFE filter), the 2\u2010stage National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health cyclone sampler (NIOSH cyclone sampler) and the 6\u2010stage viable Andersen impactor (Andersen impactor). RESULTS: The PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone sampler collected similar amounts of viral RNA and infectious virus from artificially\u2010generated aerosols under a range of relative humidities (RH). Using the ferret model, the PTFE filter, NIOSH cyclone sampler and the Andersen impactor collected up to 3.66 log(10)copies of RNA/L air, 3.84 log(10)copies of RNA/L air and 6.09 log(10)copies of RNA/L air respectively at peak recovery. Infectious virus was recovered from the PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone samplers on the peak day of viral RNA recovery. CONCLUSION: The PTFE filter and NIOSH cyclone sampler are useful for influenza virus RNA and infectious virus collection and may be considered for clinical and environmental settings.","publish_time":"2019-09-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bekking, Christian; Yip, Lily; Groulx, Nicolas; Doggett, Nathan; Finn, Mairead; Mubareka, Samira","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86dfb3c7e72f3aec8bc2f425f4fd5c4c3aab2ca4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6800310.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541519/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12678","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Andersen"],"organizations":["RNA/L"],"locations":["Andersen"],"keyphrases":["influenza virus RNA","infectious influenza virus","bioaerosol system of influenza virus","PTFE filter","infectious virus collection","copies of RNA","NIOSH cyclone samplers","Health cyclone sampler","collection of viral RNA","Bioaerosol sampling devices","ferret model of influenza virus infection","artificial bioaerosol system","polytetrafluoroethylene filter","determinant of bioaerosol emission","similar amounts of viral RNA","acute respiratory virus infections","moderate volume bioaerosol samplers","peak day of viral RNA recovery","log","air","characterization of infectious bioaerosols","infected ferrets","controlled environmental conditions","stage viable Andersen impactor","infected hosts","range of different RH conditions","artificial bioaerosols","following samplers","peak recovery","multiple experimental conditions","environmental settings","range of relative humidities","stage National Institute of Occupational Safety","vitroand","generated aerosols","insight","performance of low","potential","BACKGROUND","impact of NSAIDs","device use","primary objective","Assessment","study","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVES","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

PEDV outbreaks have occurred continuously in most swine-producing Asian countries and have recently emerged in the United States, leading to large economic losses for both the Asian and US pig industries. The spike (S) protein of PEDV consists of the S1 and S2 domains, responsible for virus binding and fusion, respectively. The involvement of the S1 domain in specific high-affinity interactions with the cellular receptor and induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host makes it a logical target for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics against PEDV. Passive immunization by oral administration of egg yolk antibodies (IgY) obtained from immunized chickens provides an alternative source of specific antibodies for the prevention and treatment of PEDV in newborn piglets. In this study, we produced an IgY against the PEDV S1 protein and investigated its immunoprophylactic effect in neonatal piglets. A codon-optimized PEDV S1 gene consisting of amino acid residues 25\u2013749 was synthesized and used to establish a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing a recombinant PEDV S1 protein containing the chicken immunoglobulin Fc fragment at its C-terminus. The purified recombinant S1 protein was found to mediate potent immune responses in immunized hens. We next tested the ability of oral passive immunization with anti-PEDV S1 IgY to protect piglets against PEDV. Specific chicken IgY against the S1 protein was orally administered to neonatal piglets, and their responses subsequent to a virulent PEDV challenge were monitored. The results showed that oral administration of anti-PEDV S1 IgY efficiently protects neonatal piglets against PEDV, suggesting its potential as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent against acute PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2015-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Do Hyun; Jeon, Young-Soo; Park, Choi-Kyu; Kim, Seungjoon; Lee, Du Sik; Lee, Changhee","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fe40f254de626c7fac4cc0a84978f5829f9229e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087309.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2494-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26100403/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["protein of PEDV","recombinant PEDV S1 protein","treatment of PEDV","PEDV outbreaks","oral administration of anti-PEDV S1","acute PEDV infection","virulent PEDV challenge","codon-optimized PEDV S1 gene","S1 domain","neonatal piglets","purified recombinant S1 protein","newborn piglets","Specific chicken","oral administration of egg yolk antibodies","alternative source of specific antibodies","ability of oral passive immunization","specific high-affinity interactions","induction of neutralizing antibodies","responses subsequent","virus binding","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","immunized hens","immunized chickens","Asian countries","high mortality rates","potent immune responses","chicken immunoglobulin Fc fragment","contagious enteric pathogen of swine","stable porcine cell line","cellular receptor","therapeutic agent","prevention","logical target","natural host","S2 domains","development of effective vaccines","immunoprophylactic effect","large economic losses","amino acid residues","potential","C-terminus","therapeutics","United States","US pig industries","fusion","results","involvement","spike","study"],"language":"en"},

Cyclosporine A (CsA) acts immunosuppressive by blocking T cell activation and antigen presentation. Alisporivir, a non-immunosuppressive CsA analog in clinical development, does not inhibit T cell activation. In this study we explored the impact of alisporivir on antigen presentation. METHODS: Hepatoma cells endogenously expressing the epitope-restricting major histocompatibility complex-class I (MHC-I) allele HLA-A2 and constitutively expressing a viral antigen were established to study the impact of cyclophilin-inhibitors on antigen presentation. Antigen-specific CD8(\u002B) T cell activation and MHC-I surface expression were measured to quantify antigen presentation. RESULTS: Our work establishes a novel cell culture model to study antigen presentation in liver-derived cells. Authentic regulation of antigen presentation was ensured by the action of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Alisporivir pretreatment stimulated antigen presentation by hepatoma target cells, leading to enhancement of antigen-specific CD8(\u002B) T cell activation by 40%. Alisporivir, as well as a panel of other cyclophilin-inhibitors, induced an increase of MHC-I and beta-2 microglobulin on the surface of several cell lines. The drug neither enhanced MHC-I transcript or protein levels nor affected surface expression of other proteins or protein trafficking in general. Proteasome-inhibitors completely blocked the alisporivir-directed enhancement of surface MHC-I, suggesting an influence of the drug on peptide-availability. CONCLUSIONS: Alisporivir stimulates antigen presentation by inducing enhanced MHC-I surface expression, thereby promoting antigen-specific CD8(\u002B) T cell activation. This immunostimulatory function might further contribute to the antiviral activity of non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin-inhibitors.","publish_time":"2016-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esser-Nobis, Katharina; Schmidt, Julia; Nitschke, Katja; Neumann-Haefelin, Christoph; Thimme, Robert; Lohmann, Volker","journal":"J Hepatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fff17ea9203b59fb5fcd1d7dd9caf3e4a4021200.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8e82ca5df76ad0978a3f0e73e74ed138b24758ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172366.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827816001616; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168827816001616; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhep.2016.02.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26921685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs0NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cyclosporine","Alisporivir"],"organizations":["BACKGROUND","CsA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study antigen presentation","enhancement of antigen","viral antigen","Antigen-specific CD8","T cell activation","Alisporivir pretreatment stimulated antigen presentation","Authentic regulation of antigen presentation","enhancement of surface MHC","enhanced MHC","cell lines","impact of alisporivir","surface expression","increase of MHC","antiviral activity of non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin-inhibitors","impact of cyclophilin","Proteasome-inhibitors","novel cell culture model","Hepatoma cells","potent antiviral activity","hepatoma target cells","non-immunosuppressive CsA analog","drug","liver-derived cells","broad-spectrum antiviral therapy","protein levels","protein trafficking","Hepatitis C virus","clinical development","HCV","transcript","promising candidates","epitope","work","proteins","major histocompatibility complex-class","action of pro-","AIMS","beta","allele HLA-A2","anti-inflammatory cytokines","influence","BACKGROUND","microglobulin","panel","CONCLUSIONS","peptide-availability","RESULTS","Cyclosporine","METHODS","immunostimulatory function"],"language":"en"},

Here we provided a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying influenza\u2010associated exacerbations risk for occupational asthmatics, based on a combination of published distributions of viral shedding and symptoms scores and lung respiratory system properties characterized by long\u2010range peak expiratory flow (PEF) dynamics. Using a coupled detrended fluctuation analysis\u2010experimental human influenza approach, we estimated the conditional probability of moderate or severe lung airway obstruction and hence the exacerbations risk of influenza\u2010associated occupational asthma in individuals. The long\u2010range correlation exponent (\u03B1) was used as a predictor of future exacerbations risk of influenza\u2010associated asthma. For our illustrative distribution of PEF fluctuations and influenza\u2010induced asthma exacerbations risk relations, we found that the probability of exacerbations risk can be limited to below 50% by keeping \u03B1 to below 0.53. This study also found that limiting wheeze scores to 0.56 yields a 75% probability of influenza\u2010associated asthma exacerbations risk and a limit of 0.34 yields a 50% probability that may give a representative estimate of the distribution of chronic respiratory system properties.

The emergence of deadly human coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have bolstered research in these viral and often zoonotic pathogens. While coronavirus cell and tissue tropism, host range, and pathogenesis are initially controlled by interactions between the spike envelope glycoprotein and host cell receptor, it is becoming increasingly apparent that proteolytic activation of spike by host cell proteases also plays a critical role. Coronavirus spike proteins are the main determinant of entry as they possess both receptor binding and fusion functions. Whereas binding to the host cell receptor is an essential first step in establishing infection, the proteolytic activation step is often critical for the fusion function of spike, as it allows for controlled release of the fusion peptide into target cellular membranes. Coronaviruses have evolved multiple strategies for proteolytic activation of spike, and a large number of host proteases have been shown to proteolytically process the spike protein.

Most of these findings were reported during the 2009 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to detail the clinical characteristics of influenza virus-induced lower respiratory infection (LRI) during the A(H1N1)pdm09-predominant 2015\u20132016 season. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics of influenza-induced LRI cases in children admitted to a tertiary children\u0027s hospital. Molecular diagnostic evaluation was performed on samples obtained from the most severe cases. Results We identified 66 patients with influenza-associated hospitalization and included 21 patients with influenza virus-induced LRI for analyses. Twelve patients (57%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, seven (33%) required mechanical ventilation, and three (14%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Plastic bronchitis (PB) was identified in six patients (29%), among whom a past medical history of asthma or food allergy were noted in all six patients. A past history of allergic disease was more common among patients with, than among those without, PB (p = 0.009). A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected from all the PB cases, and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes demonstrated that this virus belonged to subclades 6B.1 and 6B.2. In the six PB cases, we found one patient with H275Y mutation in neuraminidase. Conclusion Allergic disease was a risk factor for developing PB due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection during the 2015\u201316 season.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Uda, Kazuhiro; Shoji, Kensuke; Koyama-Wakai, Chitose; Furuichi, Munehiro; Iwase, Noriyasu; Fujisaki, Seiichiro; Watanabe, Shinji; Miyairi, Isao","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/050afa4cdede3553e25eb3d3ceccd18377cdec99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129183.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X18300072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29433792/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X18300072; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2018.01.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ4LmNzdjs5OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1716198,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"WnfRHSI0yYDua5maXHGZ7A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_48.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","PB cases","influenza virus-induced LRI","H1N1","clinical characteristics of influenza virus","induced LRI cases","pdm09 virus infections","pdm09 infection","past history of allergic disease","severe cases","influenza-associated hospitalization","Abstract Background Influenza","pdm09-predominant","Conclusion Allergic disease","past medical history of asthma","season","lower respiratory infection","manifest severe respiratory symptoms","phylogenetic analyses","neuraminidase genes","risk factor","samples","food allergy","hemagglutinin","tertiary children\u0027s hospital","pediatric intensive care unit","Molecular diagnostic evaluation","H275Y mutation","study","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","Methods","Plastic bronchitis","subclades","findings","pandemic","mechanical ventilation","purpose"],"language":"en"},

More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19. We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19. Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives. In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk. Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage \u2013 in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control \u2013 should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme. In a COVID\u002B patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction. Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Javelot, H.; Llorca, P.-M.; Drapier, D.; Fakra, E.; Hingray, C.; Meyer, G.; Dizet, S.; Egron, A.; Straczek, C.; Roser, M.; Masson, M.; Gaillard, R.; Fossati, P.; Haffen, E.","journal":"Encephale","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7196532.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376004/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.006","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["various psychotropic drugs","classes of psychotropic drugs","use of psychotropic drugs","prescription of psychotropic drugs","risk ratio of psychotropic treatments","reference drugs","iatrogenic risk","risk of changes","pulmonary risk","evolution of COVID","various risk factors","symptoms suggestive of COVID","increase risk of relapse","infected patients","terms of benefit","specific benefit","used psychotropics","terms of morbidity","social terms","SARS-CoV","cough","frequent interactions","coronavirus pandemic","coronavirus disease","specific attention","dyspnea","Specific knowledge","plasma concentrations","various molecules","psychiatric disorders","symptomatic treatments","appearance of respiratory symptoms","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","dramatic consequences","epidemic context","situation unprecedented","false negatives","false positives","digestive signs","inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme","case of minimal infectious signs","resistant schizophrenia","implication","vigilance","bipolar disorder","dosage","world\u0027s population","populations","mortality","fever","antidepressants","brutal modification","abrupt cessation of smoking","clinical response","general confinement","impact","half","effects","history","infection","differential diagnosis","confusion","antipsychotics","face of previous dose reductions","curative treatment","loss of efficiency","individual","collective levels","account","possibility","elderly","cardiac conduction","Clozapine","literature","association","people","caution","rigor","risks","rapid control","Lithium","review","Tobacco","Psychiatrists"],"language":"en"},

Although vaccination is the most effective means of protection against influenza, frequent mutations in viral surface antigens, low protective efficacy of the influenza vaccine in the elderly, slow production process and the potential of vaccine supply shortage during a pandemic are significant limitations of current vaccines. Adjuvants have been used to enhance the efficacy of a variety of vaccines; however, no adjuvant is included in current influenza vaccines approved in the United States. In this study, we found that a novel adjuvant, rOv-ASP-1, co-administrated with inactivated influenza vaccine using an aqueous formulation, substantially improved the influenza-specific antibody response and protection against lethal infection in a mouse model. rOv-ASP-1 enhanced the magnitude of the specific antibody response after immunization with low doses of influenza vaccine, allowing antigen-sparring by 10-fold. The rOv-ASP-1 formulated vaccine induced a more rapid response and a stronger Th1-associated antibody response compared to vaccine alone and to the vaccine formulated with the adjuvant alum. Importantly, rOv-ASP-1 significantly enhanced cross-reactive antibody responses and protection against challenge with an antigenically distinct strain. These results demonstrate that rOv-ASP-1 is an effective adjuvant that: 1) accelerates and enhances the specific antibody response induced by influenza vaccine; 2) allows for antigen sparing; and 3) augments a Th1-biased and cross-reactive antibody response that confers protection against an antigenically distinct strain.","publish_time":"2014-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Jiu; Fisher, Erin M.; Hensley, Scott E.; Lustigman, Sara; Murasko, Donna M.; Shen, Hao","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c35d5d138487c2999331ff6c6dcb489ec52cbbf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/06dbf9dc0dbe752f642f941977d34444c7007706.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4080630.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4080630?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X14004150; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14004150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681229/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.03.046","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["influenza-specific antibody response","inactivated influenza vaccine","formulated vaccine","rOv-ASP","low doses of influenza vaccine","current influenza vaccines","rapid response","stronger Th1-associated antibody response","cross-reactive antibody responses","effective adjuvant","potential of vaccine supply shortage","novel adjuvant","adjuvant alum","effective means of protection","variety of vaccines","elderly","distinct strain","significant limitations of current vaccines","low protective efficacy","Th1-biased","antigen sparing","viral surface antigens","pandemic","frequent mutations","immunization","lethal infection","slow production process","challenge","health of humans","aqueous formulation","common infectious diseases","young children","magnitude","mouse model","United States","vaccination","results","study","fold","Adjuvants"],"language":"en"},

Current operative strategies include either direct nerve repair, nerve grafting, nerve transfer, or neurotization. The goal of this study is to compare muscle recovery using microneural repair versus neurotization in a rat model of chronic denervation. Methods Fifty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats had surgical denervation of the tibialis anterior muscle by transecting the common peroneal nerve. After 0, 8, 12, or 22 weeks of denervation, animals were assigned to either a direct repair or a neurotization cohort. An additional 7 animals were used for a sham cohort, and 7 of the 58 were used as controls. After a 12-week recovery period, animals had contractile strength and EMG testing of the tibialis anterior muscle. Peak force and characteristics were compared to the unoperated, contralateral limb. Tibialis anterior muscles were then harvested for mass and histologic evaluation. Results Sixty-two animals completed testing. Denervated controls demonstrated a significant decrease in muscle mass, contractile strength, and peak motor nerve conduction amplitude compared to sham animals. In all groups, chronicity of denervation adversely affected functional recovery. On average, repair animals performed better than neurotization animals with respect to muscle mass, contractile strength, and peak motor amplitude. Differences in contractile force, however, were significant only at the 0 week denervation group (94% \u00B1 30 vs 50% \u00B1 20, repair vs neurotization). Neurotized muscles processed for histologic analysis demonstrated acetylcholinesterase activity at the nerve-muscle interface, confirming the formation of motor end plates de novo. Conclusions We demonstrated that neurotization is capable of reinnervating de novo end plates in chronically denervated muscle. Our data do not support the hypothesis that direct muscle neurotization is superior to nerve repair for functional restoration of chronically denervated muscle. However, as the duration of denervation increases, the difference between outcomes of the neurotization and repair group narrows, suggesting that neurotization may offer a viable surgical alternative in the setting of prolonged denervation.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Swanson, Andrew N.; Wolfe, Scott W.; Khazzam, Michael; Feinberg, Joseph; Ehteshami, John; Doty, Stephen","journal":"The Journal of Hand Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/992395a1a5a3e251c52be71ff12a1c1f768d23f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126155.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363502308002232; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0363502308002232; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhsa.2008.02.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18762103/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjs5NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neurotization animals","direct muscle neurotization","denervated muscle","repair animals","muscle mass","muscle recovery","nerve-muscle interface","repair vs neurotization","direct nerve repair","neurotization cohort","direct repair","surgical denervation","sham animals","nerve grafting","nerve transfer","microneural repair","chronicity of denervation","weeks of denervation","week denervation group","contractile strength","repair group narrows","peak motor nerve conduction amplitude","common peroneal nerve","contractile force","setting of prolonged denervation","duration of denervation increases","Denervated controls","peak motor amplitude","Tibialis anterior muscles","rat model of chronic denervation","functional recovery","Peak force","formation of motor end plates","novo end plates","week recovery period","sham cohort","significant decrease","EMG testing","histologic analysis","functional restoration","Neurotized muscles","histologic evaluation","viable surgical alternative","acetylcholinesterase activity","outcomes","respect","capable of reinnervating","Sprague-Dawley rats","hypothesis","Current operative strategies","Methods","characteristics","study","Purpose Reinnervation","contralateral limb","groups","Conclusions","Differences","average","goal","data","Results"],"language":"en"},

This presents a more practical and challenging application and moves towards bridging visual medical features and radiologist text. So far, the most common approach has been to utilize publicly available datasets and develop DL models that integrate convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image analysis alongside recurrent neural networks (RNN) for natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG). This is an area of research that we anticipate will grow in the near future. We focus our investigation on the following critical challenges: understanding radiology text/image structures and datasets, applying DL algorithms (mainly CNN and RNN), generating radiology text, and improving existing DL based models and evaluation metrics. Lastly, we include a critical discussion and future research recommendations.

Overexpression of HACE1 inhibited Sendai virus- or poly (I:C)-induced signaling and resulted in reduced IFNB1 production and enhanced virus replication. Knockdown of HACE1 expression exhibited the opposite effects. Ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of the dead mutant HACE1/C876A had a comparable inhibitory function as WT HACE1, suggesting that the suppressive function of HACE1 on virus-induced signaling is independent of its E3 ligase activity. Further study indicated that HACE1 acted downstream of MAVS and upstream of TBK1. Mechanistic studies showed that HACE1 exerts its inhibitory role on virus-induced signaling by disrupting the MAVS-TRAF3 complex.

Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), transmitted by WBPH, has become a great threat to rice production in East Asia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By de novo transcriptome assembling and massive parallel pyrosequencing, we constructed two transcriptomes of WBPH and profiled the alternation of gene expression in response to SRBSDV infection in transcriptional level. Over 25 million reads of high-quality DNA sequences and 81388 different unigenes were generated using Illumina technology from both viruliferous and non-viruliferous WBPH. WBPH has a very similar gene ontological distribution to other two closely related rice planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens and Laodelphax striatellus. 7291 microsatellite loci were also predicted which could be useful for further evolutionary analysis. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the two transcriptomes generated from viruliferous and non-viruliferous WBPH provided a list of candidate transcripts that potentially were elicited as a response to viral infection. Pathway analyses of a subset of these transcripts indicated that SRBSDV infection may perturb primary metabolism and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. In addition, 5.5% (181 out of 3315) of the genes in cell cytoskeleton organization pathway showed obvious changes. Our data also demonstrated that SRBSDV infection activated the immunity regulatory systems of WBPH, such as RNA interference, autophagy and antimicrobial peptide production. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We employed massively parallel pyrosequencing to collect ESTs from viruliferous and non-viruliferous samples of WBPH. 81388 different unigenes have been obtained. We for the first time described the direct effects of a Reoviridae family plant virus on global gene expression profiles of its insect vector using high-throughput sequencing. Our study will provide a road map for future investigations of the fascinating interactions between Reoviridae viruses and their insect vectors, and provide new strategies for crop protection.","publish_time":"2012-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Yi; Zhou, Wenwu; Zhou, Yijun; Wu, Jianxiang; Zhou, Xueping","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a23e98e1cc196167116f87f71aae771739bdf0d0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3338671.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22558400/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036238","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjsyODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Illumina","WBPH"],"locations":["East Asia"],"keyphrases":["non-viruliferous WBPH","transcriptomes of WBPH","non-viruliferous samples of WBPH","SRBSDV infection","immunity regulatory systems of WBPH","viral infection","alternation of gene expression","Reoviridae viruses","response","different unigenes","Reoviridae family plant virus","global gene expression profiles","transmitting plant viruses","massive parallel pyrosequencing","related rice planthoppers","insect vectors","direct feeding","direct effects","similar gene ontological distribution","Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus","great damage","great threat","Pathway analyses","evolutionary analysis","comparative analysis","antimicrobial peptide production","list of candidate transcripts","cell cytoskeleton organization pathway","novo transcriptome","fascinating interactions","RNA interference","crops","ESTs","future investigations","primary metabolism","Illumina technology","new strategies","obvious changes","autophagy","Nilaparvata","white backed planthopper","Sogatella furcifera","Horv\u00E1th","road map","high-throughput sequencing","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","high-quality DNA sequences","subset","transcriptional level","ubiquitin-proteasome pathways","Laodelphax striatellus","East Asia","crop protection","BACKGROUND","SIGNIFICANCE","METHODOLOGY","study","time","data","microsatellite loci","CONCLUSIONS","addition"],"language":"en"},

It has mutated and spread throughout the world in dog populations. We provide an update on the molecular characterization of CPV that circulated in Nanjing, a provincial capital in China between 2009 and 2012. RESULTS: Seventy rectal swab samples were collected from the dogs diagnosed with CPV infection in 8 animal hospitals of Nanjing. Sequence analysis of VP2 genes of 31 samples revealed that 29 viral strains belonged to CPV-2a subtype, while other two strains were classified into CPV-2b. To investigate the pathogenicity of the prevalent virus, we isolated CPV-2a and performed the animal experiment. Nine beagles were inoculated with 10(5.86) of 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID(50)) of the virus. All the experimentally infected beagles exhibited mild to moderate mucoid or watery diarrhea on day 4 post-infection (p.i.). On day 9 p.i., characteristic histopathological lesions were clearly observed in multiple organs of infected dogs, including liver, spleen, kidney, brain and all segments of the small and large intestines, while viral DNA and antigen staining could be detected in the sampled tissues. It is notable that canine parvovirus was isolated in one from two brain samples processed. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that CPV-2a is the predominant subtype in Nanjing of China.

Abstract Introduction Infections are very frequent in patients who are admitted to Intensive Care Units, sometimes being a reason for admission and in others the infection is acquired during ICU stay. Epidemiology The most frequent causes of acquired infection in the community that require admission to the ICU are respiratory infections, urinary tract infections and infections of the central nervous system. Among the infections acquired in the ICU, devices-associated infections are the most frequent. Etiology The most frequent in ICU are Gram negative pathogens. Etiopathogenesis In the critical patient, several factors are combined making them especially vulnerable to infections. Clinical manifestations Depends on the location of the infection. Diagnosis It must be early due to its increased mortality. Prognosis Nosocomial infections are associated with an increase in mortality and in the length of stay. Treatment The delay in treatment is associated with an increase in mortality.","publish_time":"2018-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asensio Mart\u00EDn, M.

However, the difficulty, time and expense of generating full-length sequences individually from each archived sample have hampered these studies. Next generation sequencing technologies have been utilized for analysis of clinical and environmental samples to identify viral pathogens that may be present. This has led to the discovery of many new, uncharacterized viruses from a number of viral families. Use of these sequencing technologies would be advantageous in examining viral evolution. In this study, a sequencing procedure was used to sequence simultaneously and rapidly multiple archived samples using a single standard protocol. This procedure utilized primers composed of 20 bases of known sequence with 8 random bases at the 3\u2032-end that also served as an identifying barcode that allowed the differentiation each viral library following pooling and sequencing. This conferred sequence independence by random priming both first and second strand cDNA synthesis. Viral stocks were treated with a nuclease cocktail to reduce the presence of host nucleic acids. Viral RNA was extracted, followed by single tube random-primed double-stranded cDNA synthesis. The resultant cDNAs were amplified by primer-specific PCR, pooled, size fractionated and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM platform. The individual virus genomes were readily assembled by both de novo and template-assisted assembly methods. This procedure consistently resulted in near full length, if not full-length, genomic sequences and was used to sequence multiple bovine pestivirus and coronavirus isolates simultaneously.","publish_time":"2014-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neill, John D.; Bayles, Darrell O.; Ridpath, Julia F.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffdd6ba963bcbed1b9e7a293b06529bb4da989b6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119728.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.02.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093414000664; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24589514/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093414000664","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral library","viral pathogens","Viral stocks","Viral RNA","study of viral evolution","sequencing procedure","number of viral families","sequences of archived viruses","random bases","full-length sequences","multiple archived samples","bases of known sequence","generation sequencing technologies","random priming","genomic sequences","present","conferred sequence independence","strand cDNA synthesis","single tube random-primed double-stranded cDNA synthesis","environmental samples","uncharacterized viruses","single standard protocol","multiple bovine pestivirus","design of new vaccines","differentiation","size fractionated","primer-specific PCR","analysis of clinical","coronavirus isolates","nuclease cocktail","time","expense","pooling","years","presence of host nucleic acids","Ion Torrent PGM platform","novo","template","assembly methods","identifying barcode","discovery","primers","Abstract","resultant cDNAs","individual virus genomes","difficulty","studies"],"language":"en"},

To develop a simple, rapid, accurate, and high-throughput detection method for diagnosis and differential diagnosis on swine enteric coronaviruses, specific primers and probes were designed based on the highly conserved regions of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) N, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) M, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) M, and porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) N genes respectively. A TaqMan-probe-based multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect these swine enteric coronaviruses. The results showed that the limit of detection can reach as low as 10 copies in singular real-time RT-qPCR assays and 100 copies in multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay, with all correlation coefficients (R(2)) at above 0.99, and the amplification efficiency at between 90 and 120%. This multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay demonstrated high sensitivity, extreme specificity, and excellent repeatability. The multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay was then employed to detect the swine enteric coronavirus from 354 field diarrheal samples. The results manifested that TGEV and PDCoV were the main pathogens in these samples, accompanied by co-infections. This well-established multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay provided a rapid, efficient, specific, and sensitive tool for detection of swine enteric coronaviruses.

The viral papain-like proteases (PLPs) are critical for processing the amino-terminal end of the replicase and are attractive targets for antiviral therapies. With the analysis of the papain-like protease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), came the realization of the multifunctional nature of these enzymes. Structural and enzymatic studies revealed that SARS-CoV PLpro can act as both a protease to cleave peptide bonds and also as a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme to cleave the isopeptide bonds found in polyubiquitin chains. Furthermore, viral DUBs can also remove the protective effect of conjugated ubiquitin-like molecules such as interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15). Extension of these studies to other coronaviruses and arteriviruses led to the realization that viral protease/DUB activity is conserved in many family members. Overexpression studies revealed that viral protease/DUB activity can modulate or block activation of the innate immune response pathway. Importantly, mutations that alter DUB activity but not viral protease activity have been identified and arteriviruses expressing DUB mutants stimulated higher levels of acute inflammatory cytokines after infection. Further understanding of the multifunctional nature of the Nidovirus PLP/DUBs may facilitate vaccine development. Here, we review studies describing the PLPs\u2019 enzymatic activity and their role in virus pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2014-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mielech, Anna M.; Chen, Yafang; Mesecar, Andrew D.; Baker, Susan C.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76b85d5688d6c60e7a91506f0ab03b8462ef48d6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/45de9e3fa82e45cc8c88661dbffd27a70a2b41a6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4125544.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.01.025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170214000409; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170214000409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24512893/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4125544?pdf=render","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzQ5LmNzdjszNzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1669378,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"G4i9QPlhfnCkelsppKJafQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_49.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral protease activity","DUB activity","viral DUBs","viral proteases","viral papain","enzymatic activity","viral RNA synthesis","DUB mutants","arteriviruses","enzymatic studies","Overexpression studies","realization","PLPs","multifunctional nature","Coronaviruses","protease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus","SARS-CoV PLpro","isopeptide bonds","family members","large replicase polyproteins","interferon stimulated gene","positive strand RNA viruses","higher levels of acute inflammatory cytokines","order Nidovirales","block activation","molecules","nonstructural proteins","Nidovirus PLP","role","innate immune response pathway","protective effect of conjugated ubiquitin","attractive targets","amino-terminal end","infection","antiviral therapies","vaccine development","virus pathogenesis","ISG15","polyubiquitin chains","enzymes","Extension","analysis","mutations"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Twenty-six papers published from database inception to December 2018 were reviewed. A wide range of psychological and non-psychological outcomes were reported. There was a marked trend for isolated patients to exhibit higher levels of depression, the pooled standardised mean difference being 1.28 (95% CI 0.47 to 2.09) and anxiety 1.45 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.34), although both had high levels of heterogeneity, and worse outcomes for a range of care-related factors but with significant variation. CONCLUSION: The review indicates that isolation to contain the risk of infection has negative consequences for segregated patients. Although strength of the evidence is weak, comprising primarily single-centre convenience samples, consistency of the effects may strengthen this conclusion.

Most cases have been reported from Saudi Arabia, and the disease epidemic potential is considered to be limited. However, human\u2013human transmission has occurred, usually in the context of healthcare facility-associated outbreaks. The scientific and medical community depends on timely publication of epidemiological information on emerging diseases during outbreaks to appropriately target public health responses. In this review, we considered the academic response to four MERS CoV outbreaks that occurred in Al-Hasa in 2013, Jeddah in 2014 and Riyadh in 2014 and 2015. We analysed 68 relevant epidemiology articles. For articles for which submission dates were available, six articles were submitted during the course of an outbreak. One article was published within a month of the Al-Hasa outbreak, and one each was accepted during the Jeddah and Riyadh outbreaks. MERS-CoV epidemiology articles were cited more frequently than articles on other subjects in the same journal issues. Thus, most epidemiology articles on MERS-CoV were published with no preferential advantage over other articles.

Objective To identify biomarkers for disease severity and progression of COVID-19. Methods Forty-eight cytokines in the plasma samples from 50 COVID-19 cases including 11 critically ill, 25 severe and 14 moderate patients were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical data. Results Fourteen cytokines were found to be significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases and showed different expression profiles in patients with different disease severity. Moreover, expression levels of IP-10, MCP-3, HGF, MIG and MIP-1\u03B1, which were shown to be highly associated with disease severity during disease progression, were remarkably higher in critically ill patients, followed by severe and then the moderate patients. Serial detection of the five cytokines in 16 cases showed that continuously high levels were associated with deteriorated progression of disease and fatal outcome. Furthermore, IP-10 and MCP-3 were excellent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of the two cytokines showed the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) calculations with a value of 0.99. Conclusion In this study, we report biomarkers that highly associated with disease severity and progression of COVID-19. These findings add to our understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provide potential therapeutic targets and strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Yang; Shen, Chenguang; Li, Jinxiu; Yuan, Jing; Wei, Jinli; Huang, Fengmin; Wang, Fuxiang; Li, Guobao; Li, Yanjie; Xing, Li; Peng, Ling; Yang, Minghui; Cao, Mengli; Zheng, Haixia; Wu, Weibo; Zou, Rongrong; Li, Delin; Xu, Zhixiang; Wang, Haiyan; Zhang, Mingxia; Zhang, Zheng; Gao, George F.; Jiang, Chengyu; Liu, Lei; Liu, Yingxia","journal":"J Allergy Clin Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6682eebe7f583cf4885bec78924cfa36e826d1ff.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920305765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360286/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.04.027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920305765?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MIG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease progression","progression of COVID","different disease severity","deteriorated progression of disease","cytokines","outbreak of Coronavirus Disease","biomarkers","cases","ill patients","moderate patients","SARS-CoV","MCP","expression levels of IP","combination","different expression profiles","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","high levels","immunopathologic mechanisms of SARS","urgent need","ROC","AUC","public health","infection","receiver-operating characteristics","plasma samples","calculations","potential therapeutic targets","curve","MIG","understanding","biggest area","Abstract Background","fatal outcome","excellent predictors","MIP","strategies","serious threat","HGF","Methods","Objective","value","clinical data","study","Serial detection","Conclusion","findings","Results","Wuhan"],"language":"en"},

Currently, well-known pathogens such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens type C appear to play a minor role in development of disease. Other infectious pathogens may be involved. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence of selected infectious pathogens in neonatal piglets with clinical and pathological signs of enteric disease. The association between rotavirus A, Enterococcus hirae, Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens type A/C and diarrhoea was investigated in a case control study on piglet level. The possible role of E. coli virulence factors was investigated in a multistep-procedure using herd-pools of E.coli isolates to screen for their presence. RESULTS: Rotavirus A was detected more often in cases (25%) than in controls (6%) (P \u003C 0.001). The detection rate of Enterococcus hirae, Clostridium difficile and C. perfringens type A positive for beta2 genes was the same in the two groups of piglets. C. perfringens type C was not detected in the study. Investigations on E. coli virulence factors showed a high prevalence of EAST1 toxin genes (55% of tested case piglets were positive) and AIDA-1 adhesin genes (63% of toxin positive case piglets were positive) in case piglets. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of rotavirus A was statistically significantly associated with neonatal piglet diarrhoea. An aetiologic role of E. coli carrying virulence factors EAST1 and AIDA-1 needs further investigation as the study points out these two factors as possible causative factors in neonatal diarrhoea. Detection of E.hirae, C.difficile and C. perfringens type A carrying beta 2 genes was not associated with neonatal piglet diarrhoea. However, the study suggested that massive overgrowth by E. hirae could be part of the pathogenesis in some cases of neonatal diarrhoea.

A new human-pathogenic parvovirus, human bocavirus (HBoV), has recently been discovered and associated with respiratory disease in small children. However, many patients have presented with low viral DNA loads, suggesting HBoV persistence and rendering polymerase chain reaction-based diagnosis problematic. Moreover, nothing is known of HBoV immunity. We examined HBoV-specific systemic B cell responses and assessed their diagnostic use in young children with respiratory disease. Patients and methods. Paired serum samples from 117 children with acute wheezing, previously studied for 16 respiratory viruses, were tested by immunoblot assays using 2 recombinant HBoV capsid antigens: the unique part of virus protein 1 and virus protein 2. Results. Virus protein 2 was superior to the unique part of virus protein 1 with respect to immunoreactivity. According to the virus protein 2 assay, 24 (49%) of 49 children who were positive for HBoV according to polymerase chain reaction had immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies, 36 (73%) had IgG antibodies, and 29 (59%) exhibited IgM antibodies and/or an increase in IgG antibody level. Of 22 patients with an increase in antibody levels, 20 (91%) had a high load of HBoV DNA in the nasopharynx, supporting the hypothesis that a high HBoV DNA load indicates acute primary infection, whereas a low load seems to be of less clinical significance. In a subgroup of patients who were previously determined to have acute HBoV infection (defined as a high virus load in the nasopharynx, viremia, and absence of other viral infections), 9 (100%) of 9 patients had serological evidence of primary infection. In the control group of 68 children with wheezing who had polymerase chain reaction results negative for HBoV in the nasopharynx, 9 (13%) had IgM antibodies, including 5 who displayed an increase in IgG antibody levels and were viremic. No cross-reactivity with human parvovirus B19 was detected. Conclusions. Respiratory infections due to HBoV are systemic, elicit B cell immune responses, and can be diagnosed serologically. Serological diagnoses correlate with high virus loads in the nasopharynx and with viremia. Serological testing is an accurate tool for disclosing the association of HBoV infection with disease.","publish_time":"2008-02-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kantola, Kalle; Hedman, Lea; Allander, Tobias; Jartti, Tuomas; Lehtinen, Pasi; Ruuskanen, Olli; Hedman, Klaus; S\u00F6derlund-Venermo, Maria","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c1022e386fb573785e5b3d7cf9ffce1762e9fa0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107971.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1086/526532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18199037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HBoV persistence","HBoV immunity","acute HBoV infection","virus protein","high load of HBoV DNA","high HBoV DNA load","association of HBoV infection","high virus load","nasopharynx","recombinant HBoV capsid antigens","HBoV-specific systemic B cell responses","respiratory disease","IgG antibodies","acute primary infection","low load","young children","small children","increase","Respiratory infections","subgroup of patients","IgM antibodies","polymerase chain reaction results","IgG antibody levels","acute wheezing","serological evidence of primary infection","respiratory viruses","low viral DNA loads","polymerase chain reaction-based diagnosis problematic","human bocavirus","human parvovirus B19","viral infections","Serological testing","Serological diagnoses","viremia","B cell immune responses","new human-pathogenic parvovirus","diagnostic use","assays","immunoglobulin","hypothesis","accurate tool","cross-reactivity","Paired serum samples","absence","control group","viremic","respect","immunoreactivity","clinical significance","methods","Background","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

It is necessary for the development and repair of the brain and protection from oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which apoD interacts with lipoproteins in human plasma. By using detergent-free ELISA, we show that immobilized monoclonal antibodies against apoD very efficiently bind to low density lipoprotein (LDL) from plasma; this binding is as equally efficient as binding to an anti-apoB monoclonal antibody. Adding detergent to the plasma inhibited the binding, suggesting that the binding is dependent on the presence of intact lipoprotein particles. Reversing the system by using immobilized anti-apoB revealed that the affinity of apoD for LDL is rather low, suggesting that multiple bindings are needed for a durable connection. Biosensor experiments using purified lipoproteins also showed that purified apoD and high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3), a lipoprotein fraction rich in apoD, were both able to bind LDL very efficiently, indicating that the HDL3-LDL interaction may be a physiological consequence of the affinity of apoD for LDL. Furthermore, we found that apoD increases the binding of HDL to actively growing T24 bladder carcinoma cells but not to quiescent, contact-inhibited, confluent T24 cells. This result is especially intriguing given that the T24 supernatant only contained detectable levels of apoD after growth inhibition, raising the possibility that alternating the expression of apoD and a putative apoD-receptor could give direction to the flow of lipids. In the current paper, we conclude that apoD mediates binding of HDL to LDL and to growing T24 carcinomas, thereby highlighting the importance of apoD in lipid metabolism.","publish_time":"2014-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Braesch-Andersen, Sten; Beckman, Lena; Paulie, Staffan; Kumagai-Braesch, Makiko","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9367d8e090900c57b11a99848144bd83dcb80bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4267786.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25513803/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["purified apoD","affinity of apoD","importance of apoD","expression of apoD","detectable levels of apoD","putative apoD-receptor","binding of HDL","HDL3-LDL interaction","low density lipoprotein","T24 supernatant","T24 carcinomas","confluent T24 cells","high density lipoprotein","purified lipoproteins","immobilized anti-apoB","growing T24 bladder carcinoma cells","lipoprotein fraction rich","human plasma","anti-apoB monoclonal antibody","presence of intact lipoprotein particles","immobilized monoclonal antibodies","detergent-free ELISA","brain","direction","growth inhibition","contact","physiological consequence","repair","important protein","protection","possibility","multiple bindings","parts","development","oxidative stress","Biosensor experiments","lipid metabolism","system","extent","durable connection","flow of lipids","study","Apolipoprotein","result","current paper","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Although community ecology approaches have been used to identify pathogen interactions at the within-host scale, methodologies enabling robust identification of interactions from population-scale data such as that available from health authorities are lacking. To address this gap, we developed a statistical framework that jointly identifies interactions between multiple viruses from contemporaneous non-stationary infection time series. Our conceptual approach is derived from a Bayesian multivariate disease mapping framework. Importantly, our approach captures within- and between-year dependencies in infection risk while controlling for confounding factors such as seasonality, demographics and infection frequencies, allowing genuine pathogen interactions to be distinguished from simple correlations. We validated our framework using a broad range of synthetic data.

Here we make use of the state space reconstruction to construct the symbolic sequences and quantify the similarity of different stock markets and exchange rate markets considering the chaotic behavior between the complex time series.

We conclude that the reconstructed phase space information clustering method is effective to research the close relationship in time series and for short time series especially. Besides, we report the results of similarity of different exchange rate time series in different periods and find the effect of the exchange rate regime in 2008 on the time series.

Early recognition of BRD should lead to earlier veterinary (antibiotic/anti-inflammatory) treatment interventions thereby reducing the severity of the disease and associated costs. Coughing is one of the clinical manifestations of BRD. It is believed that by automatically and continuously monitoring the sounds within calf houses, and analysing the coughing frequency, early recognition of BRD in calves is possible. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to develop an automated calf cough monitor and examine its potential as an early warning system for BRD in artificially reared dairy calves. The coughing sounds of 62 calves were continuously recorded by a microphone over a three-month period. A sound analysis algorithm was developed to distinguish calf coughs from other sounds (e.g. mechanical sounds). During the sound recording period the health of the calves was assessed and scored periodically per week by a trained human observer. Calves presenting with BRD received antibiotic and/or anti-inflammatory treatment and the dates of treatment were recorded. This treatment date reference served as a comparison for the investigation of whether an increase in coughing frequency could be related to calves developing BRD. The calf cough detection algorithm achieved 50.3% sensitivity, 99.2% specificity and 87.5% precision. Four out of five periods, where coughing frequency was observed to be increased, coincided with the development of BRD in more than one calf. This period of increased coughing frequency was always observed before the calves were treated. Therefore, the calf cough monitor has the potential to identify early onset of BRD in calves.","publish_time":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vandermeulen, Joris; Bahr, Claudia; Johnston, Dayle; Earley, Bernadette; Tullo, Emanuela; Fontana, Ilaria; Guarino, Marcella; Exadaktylos, Vasileios; Berckmans, Daniel","journal":"Computers and Electronics in Agriculture","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43b1ac395488dea68103db51bbc449285155d496.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114224.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2016.07.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169916305105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287575/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168169916305105","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Stockperson","BRD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Early recognition of BRD","development of BRD","coughing sounds","early onset of BRD","period of increased coughing frequency","clinical manifestations of BRD","reared dairy calves","calf coughs","calf houses","anti-inflammatory treatment","automated calf cough monitor","calf cough detection algorithm","treatment interventions","dates of treatment","mechanical sounds","potential","health","early warning system","antibiotic","treatment date reference","three-month period","sound analysis algorithm","Abstract Bovine respiratory disease","complex","welfare","severity","earlier veterinary","severe economic losses","comparison","sensitivity","present study","week","trained human observer","Stockperson","associated costs","investigation","microphone","specificity","objective","periods","precision"],"language":"en"},

Public spaces have also been found an important source of infectious disease outbreaks due to poor or none infection control measures applied.

To overcome surface contamination problems, new strategies are being designed to limit the microorganisms\u2019 ability to survive over surfaces and materials. Surface modification and/or functionalization to prevent contamination is a hot-topic of research and several different approaches have been developed lately. Surfaces with anti-adhesive properties, with incorporated antimicrobial substances or modified with biological active metals are some of the strategies recently proposed. This review intends to summarize the problems associated with contaminated surfaces and their importance on infection spreading, and to present some of the strategies developed to prevent this public health problem, namely some already being commercialized.","publish_time":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Querido, Micaela Machado; Aguiar, L\u00EDvia; Neves, Paula; Pereira, Cristiana Costa; Teixeira, Jo\u00E3o Paulo","journal":"Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c358ee77c6bf3300156c1499adb924e8cfcdc45f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127218.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2019.02.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30822681/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927776519300839; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0927776519300839","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["European Union"],"keyphrases":["infection control measures","contaminated surfaces","patients","surface contamination problems","new strategies","healthcare associated infection","implementation of effective control measures","efficient cleaning measures","public health problem","different approaches","microorganisms\u2019 propagation","microorganisms\u2019 ability","Surface modification","Public spaces","World Health Organization","different levels of immunocompetent individuals","hospitals","incorporated antimicrobial substances","healthy people","anti-adhesive properties","microbiological assessment available","important source of infectious disease outbreaks","year","immunosuppressors","major role","biological active metals","extremes of age","hot-topic","young children","threat","research","previous infections","guidelines","functionalization","European Union","places","importance","materials","review"],"language":"en"},

Thus, RAS blockade with an angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) and/or angiotensin receptor blocker decreases blood pressure, cardiovascular events, and delays the progression of kidney disease. The discovery of ACE2, a homologue of ACE, capable of degrading angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, may offer new insights into the RAS. In this review we discuss the possible protective role of ACE2 in different organs, namely heart, lungs and kidneys. The role of this enzyme is inferred from recent studies performed using genetically manipulated mice that lack the ACE2 gene and also mice treated with pharmacological ACE2 inhibitors. These results suggest that ACE2 might be a new therapeutic target within the RAS.","publish_time":"2008-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jos\u00E9 Soler, Mar\u00EDa; Lloveras, Josep; Batlle, Daniel","journal":"Medicina Cl\u00EDnica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc4ec10eed999a42edb84a8f5ee5faedae2e9bf6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094457.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025775308716531; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025775308716531","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["namely heart, lungs and kidneys"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["The discovery of ACE2","The renin","ECA2","angiotensina II a angiotensina","in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal function","and delays the progression of kidney","of ACE2 in different organs","capable of degrading angiotensin II","angiotensin system","SRAA","may offer new insights into the RAS","RAS blockade with an angiotensin","cardiovascular events","riesgo cardiovascular","funci\u00F3n cardiovascular","performed using genetically manipulated mice that lack the ACE2 gene and also mice treated with pharmacological ACE2 inhibitors","lungs and kidneys","review we discuss the possible protective","These results suggest that ACE2 might be a new therapeutic target within the RAS","or angiotensin receptor blocker","reducci\u00F3n","dicha enzima","enzima conversiva","enzima hom\u00F3loga","insuficiencia renal","importancia","converting enzyme","estudios realizados","dichos estudios","ECA encargada","nueva diana terap\u00E9utica","nueva l\u00EDnea de estudio","namely heart","blood pressure","inferred from recent","plays a key","valores de presi\u00F3n arterial","modelos","deleci\u00F3n","enlentecimiento","progresi\u00F3n","aldosterona","importante regulador","Thus","degradaci\u00F3n","papel emergente","coraz\u00F3n","\u00F3rganos","antagonistas","sistema renina","pulm\u00F3n","inhibidores","administraci\u00F3n","presente revision","ri\u00F1\u00F3n","resultados","bloqueo","descubrimiento"],"language":"es"},

Six TaqMan\u2122-based quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays (Universal, Ark, Mass, DE/GA98, GA07, GA08) were developed and examined the sensitivity and specificity for each assay. Assays were developed targeting the hypervariable region in the S1 gene subunit. The analytical sensitivity of TaqMan\u2122-based quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays (qRT-PCR) assays was evaluated using synthetic DNA standards that were identical with the target sequence and specificity was further validated using clinical and biological specimens. All developed assays performed equivalently when using synthetic DNA templates as standard material, as it achieved linearity over a 5 log10 dynamic range with a reproducible limit of detection of \u226410 target copies per reaction, with high calculated amplification efficiencies ranging between 90%\u2013115%. Further validation of specificity using clinical and biological specimens was also successful.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mo, Jongseo; Angelichio, Michael; Gow, Lisa; Leathers, Valerie; Jackwood, Mark W.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d742322e47773a6a83306f2485b0448579383a7e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113781.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093419302800; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.113773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31712094/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093419302800","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["developed assays","quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays","infectious bronchitis virus","qRT-PCR","IBV","type of virus","validation of specificity","biological specimens","synthetic DNA standards","synthetic DNA templates","Abstract Infectious bronchitis","analytical sensitivity of TaqMan","target copies","target sequence","various serotypes","contagious upper respiratory tract disease of chickens","reaction","log10 dynamic range","reproducible limit of detection","linearity","standard material","hypervariable region","Mass","Ark","high calculated amplification efficiencies","GA98","S1 gene subunit","Vaccine control strategies","GA07","GA08"],"language":"en"},

From this time a few waves of epidemics caused by different IBV variants spread across the country. In order to gain more insight into the molecular epidemiology of IBV in Poland, in the present study the S1 coding region of 34 IBV isolates and nearly whole genome of 10 strains collected over a period of 38 years was characterized. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains belonged to five recently established IBV lineages: GI-1, GI-12, GI-13, GI-19 and GI-23. Additionally, two strains from 1989 and 1997 formed a separate branch of the phylogenetic tree categorized as unique early Polish variants, and one strain was revealed to be the recombinant of these and GI-1 lineage viruses. Irrespective of year of isolation and S1-dependent genotype, the genome sequences of Polish IBV strains showed the presence of six genes and 13 ORFs: 5\u2032UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3\u2032UTR, however their individual genes and putative proteins had different lengths. The phylogenetic analyses performed on the genome of ten Polish IBV strains revealed that they cluster into different groups. The Polish GI-1, GI-19 and GI-23 strains cluster with other similar viruses of these lineages, with the exception of the two strains from 1989 and 1997 which are different. It seems that in Poland in the 1980s and 1990s IBV strains with a unique genome backbone circulated in the field, which were then replaced by other strains belonging to other IBV lineages with a genome backbone specific to these lineages. The recombination analysis showed that some Polish strains resulted from a recombination event involving different IBV lineages, most frequently GI-13 and GI-19.","publish_time":"2020-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domanska-Blicharz, Katarzyna; Lisowska, Anna; Sajewicz-Krukowska, Joanna","journal":"Infect Genet Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c2fe1e37437e3014081771f9dca8fdd9faffcde.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173311.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820300095; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820300095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31917362/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104177","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Poland"],"keyphrases":["Polish GI","s IBV strains","Polish strains","different IBV lineages","genome sequences of Polish IBV strains","strains cluster","different IBV variants","IBV isolates","established IBV lineages","molecular epidemiology of IBV","b-S","unique genome backbone","different lengths","Poland","different groups","b-E","b-N","genome backbone specific","unique early Polish variants","Phylogenetic analysis","phylogenetic tree","recombination analysis","phylogenetic analyses","time","UTR","recombination event","individual genes","similar viruses","lineage viruses","S1 coding region","S1-dependent genotype","presence of infectious bronchitis virus","present study","putative proteins","waves of epidemics","poultry population","insight","year of isolation","separate branch","ORFs","field","country","period","recombinant","exception","years","order"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, about 77.17% of participants expressed a willingness to care for psychiatric patients suffering from COVID-19 virus infection. Independent predictors of willingness to care for patients included advanced training and experience of caring for patients with COVID-19.

For approximately fifty years, few sporadic infections were observed. In 2005, HAdV-B14p1, a genomic variant, re-emerged and was associated with several large ARD outbreaks across the U.S. and, subsequently, in Canada, the U.K., Ireland, and China. This strain was associated with an unusually higher fatality rate than previously reported for both this prototype and other HAdV types in general. In China, HAdV-B14 was first observed in 2010, when two unrelated HAdV-B14-associated ARD cases were reported in Southern China (GZ01) and Northern China (BJ430), followed by three subsequent outbreaks. While comparative genomic analysis, including indel analysis, shows that the three China isolates, with whole genome data available, are similar to the de Wit prototype, all are divergent from the U.S. strain (303600; 2007). Although the genomes of strains GZ01 and BJ430 are nearly identical, as per their genome type characterization and percent identities, they are subtly divergent in their genome mutation patterns. These genomes indicate possibly two lineages of HAdV-B14 and independent introductions into China from abroad, or subsequent divergence from one; CHN2012 likely represents a separate sub-lineage. Observations of these simultaneously reported emergent strains in China add to the understanding of the circulation, epidemiology, and evolution of these HAdV pathogens, as well as provide a foundation for developing effective vaccines and public health strategies, including nationwide surveillance in anticipation of larger outbreaks with potentially higher fatality rates associated with HAdV-B14p1.","publish_time":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qiwei; Jing, Shuping; Cheng, Zetao; Yu, Zhiwu; Dehghan, Shoaleh; Shamsaddini, Amirhossein; Yan, Yuqian; Li, Min; Seto, Donald","journal":"Emerg Microbes Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b97940d7cbe82e8c8b2482f6d6ab6fd45ecdbb1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5717082.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29089589/; https://doi.org/10.1038/emi.2017.78","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARD"],"locations":["The Netherlands","U.S.","Southern China","China"],"keyphrases":["HAdV-B14p1","lineages of HAdV","HAdV types","HAdV pathogens","Southern China","Northern China","unrelated HAdV-B14","China isolates","associated ARD cases","subsequent outbreaks","large ARD outbreaks","genome type characterization","BJ430","genomes of strains GZ01","anticipation of larger outbreaks","higher fatality rates","genome data available","genome mutation patterns","comparative genomic analysis","emergent strains","Wit prototype","genomic variant","subsequent divergence","Human adenovirus type","nationwide surveillance","public health strategies","effective vaccines","CHN2012","percent identities","independent introductions","acute respiratory disease","evolution","epidemiology","understanding","separate sub-lineage","circulation","foundation","years","sporadic infections","Observations","Netherlands","Ireland","Canada"],"language":"en"},

Values Recommendations were made according to the guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. Sponsors The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. Recommendations 1. All hospitals should have infection control systems in place to ensure that alerts regarding changes in exposure risk factors for SARS or other potentially serious communicable diseases are conveyed promptly to clinical units, including the labour and delivery unit (III-C). 2. At times of SARS outbreaks, all pregnant patients being assessed or admitted to the hospital should be screened for symptoms of and risk factors for SARS (III-C). 3. Upon arrival in the labour triage unit, pregnant patients with suspected and probable SARS should be placed in a negative pressure isolation room with at least 6 air exchanges per hour. All labour and delivery units caring for suspected and probable SARS should have available at least one room in which patients can safely labour and deliver while in need of airborne isolation (III-C). 4. If possible, labour and delivery (including operative delivery or Caesarean section) should be managed in a designated negative pressure isolation room, by designated personnel with specialized infection control preparation and protective gear (III-C). 5. Either regional or general anaesthesia may be appropriate for delivery of patients with SARS (III-C). 6. Neonates of mothers with SARS should be isolated in a designated unit until the infant has been well for 10 days, or until the mother\u2019s period of isolation is complete. The mother should not breastfeed during this period (III-C). 7. A multidisciplinary team, consisting of obstetricians, nurses, pediatricians, infection control specialists, respiratory therapists, and anaesthesiologists, should be identified in each unit and be responsible for the unit organization and implementation of SARS management protocols (III-C). 8. Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should not care for other pregnant patients. Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should be actively monitored for fever and other symptoms of SARS. Such individuals should not work in the presence of any SARS symptoms within 10 days of exposure to a SARS patient (III-C). 9. All health care personnel, trainees, and support staff should be trained in infection control management and containment to prevent spread of the SARS virus (III-A). 10. Regional health authorities in conjunction with hospital staff should consider designating specific facilities or health care units, including primary, secondary, or tertiary health care centres, to care for patients with SARS or similar illnesses (III-A).","publish_time":"2017-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maxwell, Cynthia; McGeer, Alison; Tai, Kin Fan Young; Sermer, Mathew","journal":"Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f13102b780fa8c0da16df0187c1236f0c2da9e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105038.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1701216317304644; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogc.2017.04.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1701216317304644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28729104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["symptoms of SARS","SARS symptoms","pregnant SARS patients","probable SARS","SARS virus","delivery of patients","pregnant patients","limited experience of SARS","times of SARS outbreaks","implementation of SARS management protocols","health care units","health care personnel","delivery units","designated unit","Preventive Health Care","infection control management","labour triage unit","tertiary health care centres","infection control specialists","infection control systems","operative delivery","unit organization","hospital staff","designated negative pressure isolation room","Regional health authorities","specialized infection control preparation","designated personnel","support staff","mother\u2019s period of isolation","clinical units","exposure risk factors","days of exposure","need of airborne isolation","guidelines","pregnancy","Society of Obstetricians","fetal outcomes","Outcomes Cases","Values Recommendations","alerts","nurses","pediatricians","Canadian Task Force","protective gear","specific facilities","respiratory therapists","Asia","document","place","conjunction","spread","trainees","containment","air exchanges","serious communicable diseases","relevant articles","general anaesthesia","Abstract Objective","Caesarean section","Case reports","expert opinion","Evidence Medline","anaesthesiologists","Gynaecologists of Canada","hospitals","arrival","presence","infant","similar illnesses","fever","multidisciplinary team","English","hour","Neonates of mothers","individuals"],"language":"en"},

The genome was comprised of 13 bp 5\u2032-UTR, three open reading frames (ORFs) including ORF1a encoding serine protease, ORF1b encoding RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and ORF2 encoding capsid protein, and 298 bp of 3\u2032-UTR which harboured two corona virus stem loop II like \u201Cs2m\u201D motifs and a poly A stretch of 19 nucleotides. The genetic analysis of CAstV/INDIA/ANAND/2016 suggested highest sequence similarity of 86.94% with the chicken astrovirus isolate CAstV/GA2011 followed by 84.76% with CAstV/4175 and 74.48%% with CAstV/Poland/G059/2014 isolates. The capsid structural protein of CAstV/INDIA/ANAND/2016 showed 84.67% similarity with chicken astrovirus isolate CAstV/GA2011, 81.06% with CAstV/4175 and 41.18% with CAstV/Poland/G059/2014 isolates. However, the capsid protein sequence showed high degree of sequence identity at nucleotide level (98.64-99.32%) and at amino acids level (97.74\u201398.69%) with reported sequences of Indian isolates suggesting their common origin and limited sequence divergence. The epitope analysis by SVMTriP identified two unique epitopes in our isolate, seven shared epitopes among Indian isolates and two shared epitopes among all isolates except Poland isolate which carried all distinct epitopes.

The selection of an appropriate adjuvant has become vital as new vaccines trend toward narrower composition, expanded application, and improved safety. Functionally, adjuvants act directly or indirectly on antigen presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells (DCs) and are perceived as having molecular patterns associated either with pathogen invasion or endogenous cell damage (known as pathogen associated molecular patterns [PAMPs] and damage associated molecular patterns [DAMPs]), thereby initiating sensing and response pathways. PAMP-type adjuvants are ligands for toll-like receptors (TLRs) and can directly affect DCs to alter the strength, potency, speed, duration, bias, breadth, and scope of adaptive immunity. DAMP-type adjuvants signal via proinflammatory pathways and promote immune cell infiltration, antigen presentation, and effector cell maturation. This class of adjuvants includes mineral salts, oil emulsions, nanoparticles, and polyelectrolytes and comprises colloids and molecular assemblies exhibiting complex, heterogeneous structures. Today innovation in adjuvant technology is driven by rapidly expanding knowledge in immunology, cross-fertilization from other areas including systems biology and materials sciences, and regulatory requirements for quality, safety, efficacy and understanding as part of the vaccine product. Standardizations will aid efforts to better define and compare the structure, function and safety of adjuvants. This article briefly surveys the genesis of adjuvant technology and then re-examines polyionic macromolecules and polyelectrolyte materials, adjuvants currently not known to employ TLR. Specific updates are provided for aluminum-based formulations and polyelectrolytes as examples of improvements to the oldest and emerging classes of vaccine adjuvants in use.","publish_time":"2015-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Powell, Bradford S.; Andrianov, Alexander K.; Fusco, Peter C.","journal":"Clin Exp Vaccine Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be179ef4eaf04a9b155ac385eeabc06620a791b2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4313107.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2015.4.1.23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25648619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TLR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["safety of adjuvants","class of adjuvants","PAMP-type adjuvants","molecular patterns","emerging classes of vaccine adjuvants","vaccine antigen","DAMP-type adjuvants signal","antigen presentation","molecular assemblies","polyelectrolytes","immune cell infiltration","endogenous cell damage","adaptive immune response","appropriate adjuvant","genesis of adjuvant technology","response pathways","vaccine product","DCs","improved safety","effector cell maturation","scope of adaptive immunity","pathogen invasion","materials sciences","proinflammatory pathways","polyelectrolyte materials","innate immunity","dendritic cells","new vaccines trend","cross-fertilization","narrower composition","areas","nanoparticles","breadth","mineral salts","regulatory requirements","oil emulsions","polyionic macromolecules","PAMPs","examples of improvements","systems biology","speed","duration","bias","potency","aluminum-based formulations","application","quality","colloids","toll","ligands","APCs","expanding knowledge","immunology","strength","heterogeneous structures","use","DAMPs","receptors","TLRs","efficacy","sensing","transport"],"language":"en"},

This is a challenge because there are dozens of bacterial and viral species that might be used in a biological attack and many have closely related near-neighbor organisms that are harmless. The biothreat agent, along with its near neighbors, can be thought of as a biothreat cluster or a biocluster for short. The ability to comprehensively detect the important biothreat clusters with resolution sufficient to distinguish the near neighbors with an extremely low false positive rate is required. A technological solution to this problem can be achieved by coupling biothreat group-specific PCR with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The biothreat assay described here detects ten bacterial and four viral biothreat clusters on the NIAID priority pathogen and HHS/USDA select agent lists. Detection of each of the biothreat clusters was validated by analysis of a broad collection of biothreat organisms and near neighbors prepared by spiking biothreat nucleic acids into nucleic acids extracted from filtered environmental air. Analytical experiments were carried out to determine breadth of coverage, limits of detection, linearity, sensitivity, and specificity. Further, the assay breadth was demonstrated by testing a diverse collection of organisms from each biothreat cluster. The biothreat assay as configured was able to detect all the target organism clusters and did not misidentify any of the near-neighbor organisms as threats. Coupling biothreat cluster-specific PCR to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry simultaneously provides the breadth of coverage, discrimination of near neighbors, and an extremely low false positive rate due to the requirement that an amplicon with a precise base composition of a biothreat agent be detected by mass spectrometry.","publish_time":"2012-06-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sampath, Rangarajan; Mulholland, Niveen; Blyn, Lawrence B.; Massire, Christian; Whitehouse, Chris A.; Waybright, Nicole; Harter, Courtney; Bogan, Joseph; Miranda, Mary Sue; Smith, David; Baldwin, Carson; Wolcott, Mark; Norwood, David; Kreft, Rachael; Frinder, Mark; Lovari, Robert; Yasuda, Irene; Matthews, Heather; Toleno, Donna; Housley, Roberta; Duncan, David; Li, Feng; Warren, Robin; Eshoo, Mark W.; Hall, Thomas A.; Hofstadler, Steven A.; Ecker, David J.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ea4880d01d03a59bb3de58e8ae226c5487e38e6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3387173.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22768032/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036528","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NIAID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biothreat agent","biothreat assay","viral biothreat clusters","important biothreat clusters","biothreat cluster-specific PCR","broad collection of biothreat organisms","biothreat group-specific PCR","spiking biothreat nucleic acids","near-neighbor organisms","discrimination of near neighbors","assay breadth","electrospray ionization mass spectrometry","breadth of coverage","diverse collection of organisms","low false positive rate","agent lists","target organism clusters","biological attack","dozens of bacterial","limits of detection","viral species","filtered environmental air","NIAID priority pathogen","HHS","USDA","resolution sufficient","precise base composition","comprehensive identification of biothreats","linearity","requirement","analysis","clinical specimens","amplicon","citizens","sensitivity","ESI-MS","Technology","case","problem","biocluster","technological solution","specificity","challenge","ability","Analytical experiments"],"language":"en"},

We found that a PPxY motif within protein VI recruits Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases to bind and ubiquitylate protein VI. We further show that this PPxY motif is involved in rapid, microtubule-dependent intracellular movement of protein VI. Ads with a mutated PPxY motif can efficiently escape endosomes but are defective in microtubule-dependent trafficking toward the nucleus. Likewise, depletion of Nedd4 ligases attenuates nuclear accumulation of incoming Ad particles and infection.

Intracellular compartmentalization\u2014governed by biomembranes as well\u2014is a characteristic feature of eukaryotic cells, which allows them to fulfill multiple and highly specialized anabolic and catabolic functions in strictly controlled environments. Although cellular membranes are generally visualized as flat sheets or closely folded isolated objects, multiple observations also demonstrate that membranes may fold into \u201Cunusual\u201D, highly organized structures with 2D or 3D periodicity. The obvious correlation of highly convoluted membrane organizations with pathological cellular states, for example, as a consequence of viral infection, deserves close consideration. However, knowledge about formation and function of these highly organized 3D periodic membrane structures is scarce, primarily due to the lack of appropriate techniques for their analysis in vivo. Currently, the only direct way to characterize cellular membrane architecture is by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). However, deciphering the spatial architecture solely based on two-dimensionally projected TEM images is a challenging task and prone to artifacts. In this review, we will provide an update on the current progress in identifying and analyzing 3D membrane architectures in biological systems, with a special focus on membranes with cubic symmetry, and their potential role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Proteomics and lipidomics approaches in defined experimental cell systems may prove instrumental to understand formation and function of 3D membrane morphologies.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Almsherqi, Zakaria A.; Landh, Tomas; Kohlwein, Sepp D.; Deng, Yuru","journal":"International Review of Cell and Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0964dabe3541149231a6517f4f2e698c7ea8838e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105030.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1937644808020066; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1937644808020066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349040/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1937-6448(08)02006-6","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["D membrane architectures","D membrane morphologies","cellular membranes","cellular membrane architecture","D periodic membrane structures","D periodicity","convoluted membrane organizations","Abstract Biological membranes","biological systems","organized structures","formation","pathological cellular states","defined experimental cell systems","multiple observations","spatial architecture","projected TEM images","potential role","challenging task","cubic symmetry","lipidomics approaches","special focus","catabolic functions","transmission electron microscopy","bilayer","isolated objects","example","flat sheets","consequence of viral infection","pathophysiological conditions","Proteomics","fascinating assemblies of biomolecules","obvious correlation","direct way","nm thick","close consideration","controlled environments","lack of appropriate techniques","characteristic feature of eukaryotic cells","update","biomembranes","small lipid molecules","analysis","artifacts","current progress","Intracellular compartmentalization","noncovalent forces","knowledge","survival","death","review"],"language":"en"},

So far selection and design rationale for such peptides is usually driven by T-cell epitope prediction, available experimental and modelled 3D structure, B-cell epitope predictions such as hydrophilicity plots or experience. If no structure is available the rational selection of peptides for the production of functionally altering or neutralizing antibodies is practically impossible. Specifically if many alternative antigens are available the reduction of required synthesized peptides until one successful candidate is found is of central technical interest. We have investigated the integration of B-cell epitope prediction with the variability of antigen and the conservation of patterns for post-translational modification (PTM) prediction to improve over state of the art in the field. In particular the application of machine-learning methods shows promising results. RESULTS: We find that protein regions leading to the production of functionally altering antibodies are often characterized by a distinct increase in the cumulative sum of three presented parameters. Furthermore the concept to maximize antigenicity, minimize variability and minimize the likelihood of post-translational modification for the identification of relevant sites leads to biologically interesting observations. Primarily, for about 50% of antigen the approach works well with individual area under the ROC curve (AROC) values of at least 0.65. On the other hand a significant portion reveals equivalently low AROC values of \u003C = 0.35 indicating an overall non-Gaussian distribution. While about a third of 57 antigens are seemingly intangible by our approach our results suggest the existence of at least two distinct classes of bioinformatically detectable epitopes which should be predicted separately. As a side effect of our study we present a hand curated dataset for the validation of protectivity classification. Based on this dataset machine-learning methods further improve predictive power to a class separation in an equilibrated dataset of up to 83%. CONCLUSION: We present a computational method to automatically select and rank peptides for the stimulation of potentially protective or otherwise functionally altering antibodies. It can be shown that integration of variability, post-translational modification pattern conservation and B-cell antigenicity improve rational selection over random guessing. Probably more important, we find that for about 50% of antigen the approach works substantially better than for the overall dataset of 57 proteins. Essentially as a side effect our method optimizes for presumably best applicable peptides as they tend to be likely unmodified and as invariable as possible which is answering needs in diagnosis and treatment of pathogen infection. In addition we show the potential for further improvement by the application of machine-learning methods, in particular Random Forests.","publish_time":"2008-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sollner, Johannes; Grohmann, Rainer; Rapberger, Ronald; Perco, Paul; Lukas, Arno; Mayer, Bernd","journal":"Immunome Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44f3796bf7bdaa361b977d350bc71190b31cf558.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2244602.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1745-7580-4-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18179690/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Random Forests"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["variability of antigen","rational selection of peptides","dataset machine-learning methods","B-cell antigenicity","application of machine","synthesized peptides","rank peptides","overall dataset","protein antigen","approach","B-cell epitope predictions","T-cell epitope prediction","likelihood of post-translational modification","integration of B","integration of variability","equilibrated dataset","post-translational modification pattern conservation","best applicable peptides","hand curated dataset","application of peptide","production","promising results","neutralizing antibodies","effect","particular Random Forests","low AROC values","conservation of patterns","D structure","random guessing","distinct increase","computational method","protein regions","alternative antigens","overall non-Gaussian distribution","distinct classes of bioinformatically detectable epitopes","PTM","predictive power","identification of relevant sites","diagnosis","needs","cumulative sum","class separation","ROC curve","significant portion","individual area","hydrophilicity plots","therapeutics","reduction","successful candidate","state","validation of protectivity classification","diagnostics","study","existence","treatment of pathogen infection","presented parameters","interesting observations","experience","potential","stimulation","improvement","design rationale","field","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","concept","proteins","addition"],"language":"en"},

In species other than suids infection is normally fatal. In these mammals, including carnivores, PRV typically causes serious neurologic disease. The endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is a wild feline endemic to south-western Europe (Iberian Peninsula). The Iberian lynx was found to be the world\u2019s most endangered felid species in 2002. In wild felines, PRV infection has only been previously reported once in a Florida panther in 1994. No seropositive lynxes have ever been found, nor has PRV been detected in dead Iberian lynxes to date. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the first reported case of pseudorabies in an Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). Pseudorabies was diagnosed in a young wild Iberian lynx from Extremadura (SW Spain) by histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis. Gross lesions included alopecia of the ventral neck, bloody gastro-intestinal contents and congestion of the brain. Histopathological analysis showed a moderate nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis with diffuse areas of demyelination, necrotizing gastritis and enteritis of the small intestine. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) antigen was found in neuronal and non-neuronal cells of the brain, tonsils, and gastric glandular epithelial cells by immunohistochemical analysis. The presence of the virus in the brain was confirmed by nested PCR. The sequence analysis of the 146 bp fragment (from the viral glycoprotein B gene) showed that the amplified sequence matched (with 100% identity) the PRV genome. Furthermore, specific DNA from glycoprotein D and E encoding-genes was detected by conventional and real-time PCR, respectively, confirming the latter that this infection was produced by a wild-type PRV strain. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the suspicion that PRV could infect the Iberian lynx. The detection of PRV in a dead Iberian lynx suggests that the virus may have a negative impact on the survival of endangered lynxes in the wild. However, because this is the first verified instance of lynx mortality resulting from pseudorabies, its true impact on the population is unknown.

In this study, we compared the treatment strategies of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and gallbladders left in situ. Methods: We randomized patients (\u003E60 years of age) after endoscopic sphincterotomy and clearance of their bile duct stones to receive early laparoscopic cholecystectomy or expectant management.

Results: One hundred seventy-eight patients entered into the trial (89 in each group); 82 of 89 patients who were randomized to receive laparoscopic cholecystectomy underwent the procedure. Conversion to open surgery was needed in 16 of 82 patients (20%). Postoperative complications occurred in 8 patients (9%). Analysis was by intention to treat.

Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment.

METHODS: We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling. RESULTS: After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics\u2019 themes and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication. Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others. We recommend that future work addresses the mass media\u2019s actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Qian; Zheng, Zequan; Zheng, Jiabin; Chen, Qiuyi; Liu, Guan; Chen, Sihan; Chu, Bojia; Zhu, Hongyu; Akinwunmi, Babatunde; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper J P; Ming, Wai-Kit","journal":"J Med Internet Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189789.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/19118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302966/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["media reports","mass media news reports","number of articles","suitable topic number","development of COVID","number of topics","Topic modeling of news articles","significance of mass media","patterns of media","ongoing COVID","coherence number","relevant news reports","topic names","major themes","related news articles","major press media","health information","crisis","coronavirus disease","popular themes","topics\u2019 themes","irrelevant reports","different themes","collected reports","parts of China","topic visualization figure","health communications","mental health","disease outbreak","main primary themes","sentiment analysis of news data","latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling","prevention","early health communication","novel coronavirus","outbreak development","day","mass media\u2019s actual impact","dreadful disease spreads","useful information","Python software","corresponding keywords","larger society","numbers of cases","coherence value","Python package Jieba","research","control procedures","medical treatment","readers","economic influences","accounting","WiseSearch database","evidence","future work","community education","donations","support","duplications","role","study","CONCLUSIONS","worldwide issue","D plane","multidimensional scaling","pathogenesis","Wuhan","OBJECTIVE","aim","RESULTS","METHODS","individuals","Hubei","containment","content","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies demonstrated that TGEV infection could lead to mitochondrial damage and upregulate miR-4331 level. So miR-4331 may play an important regulatory role in the control of mitochondrial function. To explore the potential role of miR-4331 in mitochondrial damage, we adopted a strategy consisting of quantitative proteomic analysis of porcine kidney (PK-15) cells in response to miR-4331 and TGEV infection. Eventually, 69 differentially expressed proteins were gained. The target of miR-4331 was identified. The effects of miR-4331 and its target RB1 on mitochondrial Ca(2\u002B) level, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP), p38 MAPK signaling pathway were investigated. The results showed that miR-4331 elevated mitochondrial Ca(2\u002B) level, reduced MMP, targets Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), upregulated IL1RAP, and induced activation of p38 MAPK pathway during TGEV infection. RB1 was identified as the direct targets of miR-4331 and downregulated IL1RAP, suppressed the activation of p38 MPAK, and attenuated TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage. In addition, IL1RAP played a positive role in activating p38 MAPK signaling and negative role in TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage. The data indicate that miR-4331 aggravates TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage by repressing expression of RB1, promoting IL1RAP, and activating p38 MAPK pathway.","publish_time":"2017-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xiaomin; Bai, Xiaoyuan; Guan, Lijuan; Li, Juejun; Song, Xiangjun; Ma, Xuelian; Guo, Jianxiong; Zhang, Zhichao; Du, Qian; Huang, Yong; Tong, Dewen","journal":"Mol Cell Proteomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc91f45d3fb7fbedebffb850dbf2dc3d3c7c2142.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5795386.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.ra117.000432; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29217619/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mitochondrial damage","target of miR","TGEV infection","potential role of miR","effects of miR","attenuated TGEV","mitochondrial membrane potential","elevated mitochondrial Ca","direct targets of miR","activating p38 MAPK","control of mitochondrial function","induced activation of p38 MAPK pathway","upregulated IL1RAP","downregulated IL1RAP","level","target RB1","activation of p38 MPAK","positive role","negative role","expression of RB1","important regulatory role","reduced MMP","targets Retinoblastoma","interleukin","fatal diarrhea of piglets","quantitative proteomic analysis of porcine kidney","receptor accessory protein","strategy","numerous economic losses","coronaviridae family","member","cells","response","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","Previous studies","addition","results","data","proteins"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about the relationship between EV-D68 virus and host cells. In this study, we assessed the effect of the host cell cycle on EV-D68 viral production, as well as the ability of EV-D68 to manipulate host cell cycle progression. The results suggest that synchronization in G0/G1 phase, but not S phase, promotes viral production, while synchronization in G2/M inhibits viral production. Both an early EV-D68 isolate and currently circulating strains of EV-D68 can manipulate the host cell cycle to arrest cells in the G0/G1 phase, thus providing favorable conditions for virus production. Cell cycle regulation by EV-D68 was associated with corresponding effects on the expression of cyclins and CDKs, which were observed at the level of the protein and/or mRNA. Furthermore, the viral non-structural protein 3D of EV-D68 prevents progression from G0/G1 to S. Interestingly, another member of the Picornaviridae family, EV-A71, differs from EV-D68 in that G0/G1 synchronization inhibits, rather than promotes, EV-A71 viral replication. However, these viruses are similar in that G2/M synchronization inhibits the production and activity of both viruses, which is suggestive of a common therapeutic target for both types of enterovirus. These results further clarify the pathogenic mechanisms of enteroviruses and provide a potential strategy for the treatment and prevention of EV-D68-related disease.","publish_time":"2017-02-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Zeng-yan; Zhong, Ting; Wang, Yue; Song, Feng-mei; Yu, Xiao-feng; Xing, Li-ping; Zhang, Wen-yan; Yu, Jing-hua; Hua, Shu-cheng; Yu, Xiao-fang","journal":"Front Cell Infect Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57b4aa7990ee59eb32397dc0dbb4af096a4e9aa8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5296350.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28229049/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Enterovirus"],"organizations":["G2/M"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["EV-D68 virus","EV-D68 viral production","early EV-D68","Enterovirus D68","prevention of EV","D of EV","ability of EV","strains of EV","EV-A71 viral replication","D68-related disease","G1 synchronization","G0","host cell cycle progression","G1 phase","virus production","host cells","Cell cycle regulation","viral non-structural protein","S phase","G2","results","types of enterovirus","large outbreak of severe respiratory disease","United States","treatment","favorable conditions","common therapeutic target","potential strategy","corresponding effects","expression of cyclins","Picornaviridae family","emerging pathogen","member","pathogenic mechanisms of enteroviruses","activity","relationship","CDKs","countries","study","level","mRNA"],"language":"en"},

PRRSV mainly infects porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), leading to the subversion of innate and adaptive immunity of pigs. The transcriptome analysis of gene expression profiles in PRRSV-infected PAMs is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of PRRSV. Here we performed next-generation RNA sequencing and a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to characterize the dynamic transcriptome landscapes in PAMs following PRRSV infection. Totally 38222 annotated mRNAs, 12987 annotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 17624 novel lncRNAs in PRRSV-infected PAMs were identified through a transcripts computational identification pipeline. The differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs during PRRSV infection were characterized. Several differentially expressed transcripts were validated using qRT-PCR. Analyses on dynamic overrepresented GO terms and KEGG pathways in PRRSV-infected PAMs at different time points were performed. Meanwhile the genes involved in IFN-related signaling pathways, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and processing were significantly downregulated, indicating the aberrant function of PAMs during PRRSV infection. Moreover, the differentially and highly expressed lncRNA XR_297549.1 was predicted to both cis-regulate and trans-regulate its neighboring gene, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), indicating its role in inflammatory response.

OBJECTIVES: Research questions were: 1) How well does the WURSS-21 assess the symptoms and functional impairments associated with common cold? 2) How well can this instrument measure change over time (responsiveness)? 3) What is the minimal important difference (MID) that can be detected by the WURSS-21? 4) What are the descriptive statistics for area under the time severity curve (AUC)? 5) What sample sizes would trials require to detect MID or AUC criteria? 6) What does factor analysis tell us about the underlying dimensional structure of the common cold? 7) How reliable are items, domains, and summary scores represented in WURSS? 8) For each of these considerations, how well does the WURSS-21 compare to the WURSS-44, Jackson, and SF-8? STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: People with Jackson-defined colds were recruited from the community in and around Madison, Wisconsin. Participants were enrolled within 48 hours of first cold symptom and monitored for up to 14 days of illness. Half the sample filled out the WURSS-21 in the morning and the WURSS-44 in the evening, with the other half reversing the daily order. External comparators were the SF-8, a 24-hour recall general health measure yielding separate physical and mental health scores, and the eight-item Jackson cold index, which assesses symptoms, but not functional impairment or quality of life. RESULTS: In all, 230 participants were monitored for 2,457 person-days. Participants were aged 14 to 83 years (mean 34.1, SD 13.6), majority female (66.5%), mostly white (86.0%), and represented substantive education and income diversity. WURSS-21 items demonstrated similar performance when embedded within the WURSS-44 or in the stand-alone WURSS-21. Minimal important difference (MID) and Guyatt\u0027s responsiveness index were 10.3, 0.71 for the WURSS-21 and 18.5, 0.75 for the WURSS-44. Factorial analysis suggested an eight dimension structure for the WURSS-44 and a three dimension structure for the WURSS-21, with composite reliability coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.97, and Cronbach\u0027s alpha ranging from 0.76 to 0.96. Both WURSS versions correlated significantly with the Jackson scale (W-21 R = 0.85; W-44 R = 0.88), with the SF-8 physical health (W-21 R = -0.79; W-44 R = -0.80) and SF-8 mental health (W-21 R = -0.55; W-44 R = -0.60). CONCLUSION: The WURSS-44 and WURSS-21 perform well as illness-specific quality-of-life evaluative outcome instruments. Construct validity is supported by the data presented here. While the WURSS-44 covers more symptoms, the WURSS-21 exhibits similar performance in terms of reliability, responsiveness, importance-to-patients, and convergence with other measures.","publish_time":"2009-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barrett, Bruce; Brown, Roger L; Mundt, Marlon P; Thomas, Gay R; Barlow, Shari K; Highstrom, Alex D; Bahrainian, Mozhdeh","journal":"Health Qual Life Outcomes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8eb13b64a5392a43ac16027e68b30573a9d0df0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2748069.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19674476/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7525-7-76","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Jackson"],"organizations":["Cronbach","WURSS"],"locations":["Wisconsin"],"keyphrases":["WURSS versions","stand-alone WURSS","SF","physical health","quality of life","mental health scores","symptoms","cold symptom","Participants","illness-specific health-related quality","item Jackson cold index","general health measure","illness-specific quality","Jackson scale","dimension structure","days of illness","Guyatt\u0027s responsiveness index","Jackson-defined colds","similar performance","items","minimal important difference","half","life questionnaire outcomes instrument","instrument measure change","underlying dimensional structure","terms of reliability","summary scores","life evaluative outcome instruments","functional impairments","Factorial analysis","AUC criteria","person-days","sample sizes","Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey","time severity curve","composite reliability coefficients","Cronbach\u0027s alpha ranging","People","area","SETTING","community","patients","domains","BACKGROUND","importance","STUDY DESIGN","descriptive statistics","SD","substantive education","income diversity","hours","Construct validity","data","OBJECTIVES","Research questions","majority female","convergence","measures","daily order","Madison","years","External comparators","evening","morning","RESULTS","considerations","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

However, the role of CHI3L1 in airway inflammation induced by respiratory viruses has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between CHI3L1 and airway inflammation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. METHODS: We measured YKL\u201040 levels in human nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) from hospitalized children presenting with acute respiratory symptoms. Wild\u2010type (WT) and BRP\u201039 knockout (KO) C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with live RSV (A2 strain). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue samples were obtained on day 7 after inoculation to assess lung inflammation, airway reactivity, and expression of cytokines and BRP\u201039. RESULTS: In human subjects, YKL\u201040 and IL\u201013 levels in NPA were higher in children with RSV infection than in control subjects. Expression of BRP\u201039 and Th2 cytokines, IL\u201013 in particular, was increased following RSV infection in mice. Airway inflammation caused by RSV infection was reduced in BRP\u201039 KO mice as compared to WT mice. Th2 cytokine levels were not increased in the lungs of RSV\u2010infected BRP\u201039 KO mice. BRP\u201039 regulated M2 macrophage activation in RSV\u2010infected mice. Additionally, treatment with anti\u2010CHI3L1 antibody attenuated airway inflammation and Th2 cytokine production in RSV\u2010infected WT mice.

The RNA viral genome encodes for a polyprotein that is co-translationally processed into three structural proteins and seven non-structural proteins. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a multifunctional viral protein actively secreted in vertebrate and mosquito cells during DENV infection. In mosquito cells, NS1 is secreted in a caveolin-1 (CAV-1) dependent manner by an unconventional pathway. The caveolin chaperone complex (CCC) is a cytoplasmic complex formed by caveolin-1 and the chaperones FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA which is responsible for cholesterol traffic inside the cell. In this work, we demonstrate that in infected mosquito cells, DENV NS1 is secreted by an early and unconventional route that bypasses the Golgi apparatus in close association with the CCC. Treatment of mosquito cells with classic secretion inhibitors such as brefeldin A, golgicide A and Fli-06 showed no effect on NS1 secretion, but significant reductions in recombinant luciferase secretion and virion release. Silencing the expression of CAV1, FKBP52 with siRNAs or the inhibition of CyA by cyclosporine A resulted in significant decrease in NS1 secretion without affecting virion release. Using co-localization, co-inmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, NS1 was found to co-localize and interact with all the protein components of the CCC in mosquito infected cells. In addition, CAV-1 and FKBP52 expression was found augmented in DENV infected cells. Finally, the treatment of ZIKV infected mosquito cells with brefeldin A and golgicide A showed no effect on NS1 secretion, while affecting virion release. ZIKV NS1 was also found to co-localize with CAV-1 in infected mosquito cells. These results suggest that in mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1 follows the same secretory pathway observed for DENV NS1. The association of NS1 with the cholesterol transporter CCC agrees with the lipoprotein nature of secreted hexameric NS1. Dengue protein NS1 is secreted in infected mosquito and vertebrate cells. In humans, secreted NS1 have been associated with pathogenesis. In mosquito cells, NS1 follows an unconventional secretion pathway that is dependent on Caveolin-1. This work shows that in mosquito cells, NS1 secretion is associated to the chaperone caveolin complex, a complex formed by caveolin-1 and several chaperones, in charge of cholesterol transport within the cells. Reduction of the expression or the activity of chaperone caveolin complex in mosquito infected cells, diminished the secretion of NS1 without affecting virion release. Direct interaction between NS1 and the chaperone caveolin complex proteins was demonstrated by several assays. Moreover, increased expression of the caveolin-1 and co-chaperone FKBP52 during dengue infection was found, presumably in response to the higher requirements of these proteins during dengue virus infection. Results obtained with ZIKV infected mosquito cells suggest that also ZIKV NS1 is released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin complex. The functions of secreted NS1 within mosquito are unclear. However, giving the importance of the soluble NS1 in the vertebrate host, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route may prove a valuable strategy for dengue mosquito control and patient treatment.","publish_time":"2018-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ramirez, Romel Rosales; Ludert, Juan E.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/deff731c9ab79995d16c839ae35d771d49af62f9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/500c5ea0961b573ba5355d364ca94c00a0a26e4a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/370932","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","ZIKV","CCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NS1 secretion","secretion of NS1","ZIKV NS1","DENV NS1","mosquito infected cells","association of NS1","soluble NS1","Treatment of mosquito cells","Dengue protein NS1","functions of secreted NS1","treatment of ZIKV infected mosquito cells","NS1 secretory route","DENV infected cells","vertebrate cells","caveolin chaperone complex","dengue mosquito control","chaperone caveolin complex proteins","lipoprotein nature of secreted hexameric NS1","activity of chaperone caveolin complex","co-chaperone FKBP52","unconventional secretion pathway","cytoplasmic complex","dengue infection","FKBP52 expression","DENV infection","virion release","dengue virus infection","unconventional route","unconventional pathway","co-inmunoprecipitation","co-localization","recombinant luciferase secretion","classic secretion inhibitors","unconventional secretory route","secretory pathway","chaperones FKBP52","non-structural proteins","cholesterol transporter CCC","protein components","expression of CAV1","increased expression","multifunctional viral protein","vertebrate host","brefeldin","cholesterol traffic","close association","patient treatment","golgicide","effect","results","work","charge of cholesterol transport","significant reductions","significant decrease","inhibition of CyA","dependent manner","proximity ligation assays","RNA viral genome","valuable strategy","manipulation","Golgi apparatus","siRNAs","higher requirements","cyclosporine","polyprotein","Cy40","Direct interaction","response","Fli","family Flaviviridae","addition","importance","humans","pathogenesis"],"language":"en"},

Their detection is very frequent in cases of airway involvement in children and their demonstrated causality. But the morbidity of E/RV in the neonatal period is unknown due to lack of epidemiological data. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical characteristics of these infections in hospitalized neonates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the virology specimens of all neonates hospitalized at the Caen University Hospital between 2006 and 2011. Clinical characteristics were obtained from the charts. RESULTS: During the study period, 4544 infants aged less than 28 days were hospitalized: 4159 in the neonatal ward and 385 in the pediatric ward. Among these, 711 virology specimens were available, 31 % of which identified at least one virus. An E/RV was identified in 87 patients (1.9 % of the neonates admitted during the study period): 52 in the pediatric ward (13.5 % of 385), and 35 in the neonatal ward (0.8 % of 4159). The mean gestational age was 39 weeks in the pediatric cohort and 35 weeks in the neonatal cohort. The main indication for virological analysis was persistent drowsiness (28 %), temperature above 38 \u00B0C (25 %), an apparently life-threatening event (23 %), bradycardia (20.5 %), and pallor (20.5 %). Respiratory symptoms associated with E/RV infection were coryza (74 %), cough (35 %), hypoxemia (32 %), accessory muscle use, and recession (31 %). Digestive symptoms were poor feeding (59 %), regurgitation (38 %), abdominal distension (24 %), and projectile vomiting (17 %). Twenty-three percent of the patients required admission to the neonatal ICU or pediatric ICU. Respiratory treatments included oxygen (24 % of 87 patients), continuous positive airway pressure (11 %), and ventilation (5 %). Antibiotics were prescribed in 41 % of the patients (46), but only 10 % (9) had an identified concomitant bacterial infection. In the neonatal department, nosocomial acquisition was suspected in 50 % of E/RV infections. CONCLUSION: E/RV infections have a significant morbidity in neonates, and nosocomial transmission of the virus is underestimated. We recommend that respiratory viruses, including E/RV, be tested for in any unexplained signs in a neonate. Better identification of viruses might shorten the duration of unnecessary antibiotics.","publish_time":"2017-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zacharie, S.; Vabret, A.; Guillois, B.; Dupont, C.; Brouard, J.","journal":"Arch Pediatr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126818.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28822736/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcped.2017.06.012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs0ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Caen University Hospital","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RV infections","neonatal ward","morbidity of E","neonatal period","neonatal ICU","neonatal cohort","patients","pediatric ward","neonatal department","hospitalized neonates","pediatric ICU","pediatric cohort","study period","respiratory viruses","Respiratory symptoms","weeks","clinical characteristics","Respiratory treatments","virology specimens","identified concomitant bacterial infection","virological tools","virological analysis","significant morbidity","nosocomial transmission","nosocomial acquisition","Digestive symptoms","cases of airway involvement","easy detection of rhinoviruses","Better identification of viruses","duration of unnecessary antibiotics","continuous positive airway pressure","persistent drowsiness","children","recent years","developments","enteroviruses","admission","main indication","incidence","coryza","lack of epidemiological data","demonstrated causality","poor feeding","accessory muscle use","mean gestational age","recession","INTRODUCTION","Caen University Hospital","infants","oxygen","CONCLUSION","unexplained signs","hypoxemia","regurgitation","temperature","cough","METHODS","percent","charts","RESULTS","life-threatening event","abdominal distension","projectile vomiting","bradycardia","MATERIALS","days","objective","pallor","ventilation"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed HCT recipients with HCoV detected in nasal samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCoV strains were identified using strain-specific PCR. Shedding duration was defined as time between first positive and first negative sample. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors for prolonged shedding (\u226521 days). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was conducted when \u22654 samples with cycle threshold values of \u003C28 were available. RESULTS: Seventeen of 44 patients had prolonged shedding. Among 31 available samples, 35% were OC43, 32% were NL63, 19% were HKU1, and 13% were 229E; median shedding duration was similar between strains (P = .79). Bivariable logistic regression analyses suggested that high viral load, receipt of high-dose steroids, and myeloablative conditioning were associated with prolonged shedding. mNGS among 5 subjects showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms from OC43 and NL63 starting 1 month following onset of shedding.

An older age, diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease, especially hypertension, but also chronic heart failure and coronary artery disease among others, are between the most important risk factors. In addition, during the hospitalization both hyperglycaemia and heart failure are frequent. Less frequent are acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias and stroke. Accordingly, not all prolonged stays or even deaths are due directly to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, this is the first review, focusing both on cardiovascular and metabolic aspects of this dreadful disease, in an integrated and personalized way, following the guidelines of the Cardiometabolic Health/Medicine. Therefore, current personalized aspects such as ACEIs and ARBs, the place of statins and the most appropriate management of heart failure in diabetics are analysed. Aging, better than old age, as a dynamic process, is also considered in this review for the first time in the literature, and not only as a risk factor attributed to cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities. Immunosenescence is also approached to build healthier elders, so they can resist present and future infectious diseases, and not only in epidemics or pandemics. In addition, to do this we must start knowing the molecular mechanisms that underlying Aging process in general, and immunosenescence in particular.

Finally, with a training in all the aspects covered in this review, not only the hospital stay, complications and costs of this frightening disease in high-risk population should be reduced.

TGEV infection has emerged as a major cause of severe gastroenteritis and leads to alterations of many cellular processes. Meanwhile, the pathogenic mechanism of TGEV is still unclear. microRNAs (miRNAs) are a novel class of small non-coding RNAs which are involved in the regulation of numerous biological processes such as viral infection and cell apoptosis. Accumulating data show that miRNAs are involved in the process of coronavirus infection such as replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). However, the link between miRNAs and TGEV infection is unknown. In this study, we performed microRNA microarray assay and predicted targets of altered miRNAs. The results showed TGEV infection caused the change of miRNAs profile. Then we selected miR-4331 for further analysis and subsequently identified cell division cycle-associated protein 7 (CDCA7) as the target of miR-4331. Moreover, miR-4331 showed the ability to inhibit transcription of TGEV gene 7 (a non-structure gene) via directly targeting CDCA7. In conclusion, differentially expressed miR-4331 that is caused by TGEV infection can suppress transcription of TGEV gene 7 via targeting cellular CDCA7. Our key finding is that TGEV selectively manipulates the expression of some cellular miRNAs to regulate its subgenomic transcription.","publish_time":"2015-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Song, Xiangjun; Zhao, Xiaomin; Huang, Yong; Xiang, Hailing; Zhang, Wenlong; Tong, Dewen","journal":"Int J Biol Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/22e1dd30a5cbd30d28a4d121e4876c8e327f027e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4495409.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.11585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26157346/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TGEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV infection","transcription of TGEV gene","cellular miRNAs","pathogenic mechanism of TGEV","viral infection","process of coronavirus infection","cellular CDCA7","change of miRNAs profile","cellular processes","target of miR","predicted targets of altered miRNAs","non-structure gene","subgenomic transcription","major cause of severe gastroenteritis","cell apoptosis","replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","regulation of numerous biological processes","cell division cycle-associated protein","novel class of small non-coding RNAs","microRNA microarray assay","SARS-CoV","analysis","alterations","ability","study","member of Coronaviridae family","results","expression","link","Accumulating data","microRNAs","key finding","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The diagnosis and treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been based largely on a one-size-fits-all approach. Diagnosis of COPD is based on meeting the physiologic criteria of fixed obstruction in forced expiratory flows and treatment focus on symptomatic relief, with limited effect on overall prognosis. However, patients with COPD have distinct features that determine very different evolutions of the disease. In this review we highlight distinct subgroups of COPD characterized by unique pathophysiologic derangements, response to treatment, and disease progression. It is likely that identification of subgroups of COPD will lead to discovery of much needed disease-modifying therapeutic approaches. We argue that a precision approach that integrates multiple dimensions (clinical, physiologic, imaging, and endotyping) is needed to move the field forward in the treatment of this disease.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Segal, Leopoldo N.; Martinez, Fernando J.","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99f8fe83ec882a7dd8dc34c703efe186e175c9d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5996762.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674918303324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29884286/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2018.02.035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674918303324","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Leopoldo N.

The direct transmission is considered to be a non-monotone incidence function to describe the psychological effect of some severe diseases among the population when the number of infected hosts is large and/or the disease possesses high case fatality rate. The system has a disease-free equilibrium which is locally asymptomatically stable when the basic reproduction number (R0) is less than unity and may have up to four endemic equilibria. Analytical expression representing the epidemic growth rate is obtained for the system. Sensitivity of the two transmission pathways were compared with respect to the epidemic growth rate. We numerically find that the direct transmission coefficient is more sensitive than the indirect transmission coefficient with respect to R0 and the epidemic growth rate. Local stability of endemic equilibria is studied. Further, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved using Li and Muldowney geometric approach. The explicit condition for which the system undergoes backward bifurcation is obtained. The basic model also exhibits the hysteresis phenomenon which implies diseases will persist even when R0 \u003C 1 although the system undergoes a forward bifurcation and this phenomenon is rarely observed in disease models. Consequently, our analysis suggests that the diseases with multiple transmission routes exhibit bi-stable dynamics. However, efficient application of temporary control in bi-stable regions will curb the disease to lower endemicity. In addition, increase in transmission heterogeneity will increase the chance of disease eradication.","publish_time":"2018-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nadim, Sk Shahid; Ghosh, Indrajit; Chattopadhyay, Joydev","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f71eeaa947c98938445a1265570b1cbd733468f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ddefea974fdb2730133e762ece41335b3d3cb94d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/486720","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission paths","transmission heterogeneity","transmission pathways","indirect transmission coefficient","system","multiple transmission routes","epidemic growth rate","R0","disease models","endemic equilibrium","bi-stable dynamics","chance of disease eradication","bi-stable regions","respect","severe diseases","basic model","vector","Local stability of endemic equilibria","high case fatality rate","basic reproduction number","disease-free equilibrium","hysteresis phenomenon","backward bifurcation","forward bifurcation","number of infected hosts","global asymptotic stability","contact","psychological effect","efficient application of temporary control","population","non-monotone incidence function","Analytical expression","Muldowney geometric approach","explicit condition","lower endemicity","analysis","Sensitivity","addition","paper","unity"],"language":"en"},

As part of our evaluation of the outbreak, we sequenced and published the genome sequence of the EV-D68 virus circulating in St. Louis, MO. This sequence, along with other GenBank sequences from past EV-D68 occurrences, was used to computationally select a region of EV-D68 appropriate for targeting in a strain-specific RT-PCR assay. The RT-PCR assay amplifies a segment of the VP1 gene, with an analytic limit of detection of 4 copies per reaction, and it was more sensitive than commercially available assays that detect enteroviruses and rhinoviruses without distinguishing between the two, including three multiplex respiratory panels approved for clinical use by the FDA. The assay did not detect any other enteroviruses or rhinoviruses tested and did detect divergent strains of EV-D68, including the first EV-D68 strain (Fermon) identified in California in 1962.

Our objective was to investigate the clinical features, management, and outcomes of critically ill patients with VZV-related community-acquired pneumonia (VZV-CAP). METHODS: This was an observational study of patients with VZV-CAP admitted to 29 intensive care units (ICUs) from January 1996 to January 2015. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients with VZV-CAP were included. Patients were young (age 39 years (interquartile range 32\u201351)) and 53 (52%) were immunocompromised. Time since respiratory symptom onset was 2 (1\u20133) days. There was a seasonal distribution of the disease, with more cases during spring and winter time. All but four patients presented with typical skin rash on ICU admission. Half the patients received mechanical ventilation within 1 (1\u20132) day following ICU admission (the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)) = 150 (80\u2013284), 80% with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)). Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on day 1 (odds ratio (OR) 1.90 (1.33\u20132.70); p \u003C 0.001), oxygen flow at ICU admission (OR 1.25 (1.08\u20131.45); p = 0.004), and early bacterial co-infection (OR 14.94 (2.00\u2013111.8); p = 0.009) were independently associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. Duration of mechanical ventilation was 14 (7\u201321) days. ICU and hospital mortality rates were 17% and 24%, respectively. All patients were treated with aciclovir and 10 received adjunctive therapy with steroids. Compared to 60 matched steroid-free controls, patients treated with steroids had a longer mechanical ventilation duration, ICU length of stay, and a similar hospital mortality, but experienced more ICU-acquired infections. CONCLUSIONS: Severe VZV-CAP is responsible for an acute pulmonary involvement associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. Steroid therapy did not influence mortality, but increased the risk of superinfection.

Transmission control has replaced morbidity control as the country moves towards the goal of elimination and the current challenge is to find a sensitive measure capable of gauging transmission risk in low-prevalence areas. The study aims to develop a Schistosomiasis Early Warning Index (SEWI) and demonstrate its use in Jiangsu Province along the lower Yangtze River. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Delphi approach, a structured communication technique, was used to develop the SEWI. Two rounds of interviews with 30 public health experts specialized in schistosomiasis control were conducted using 40 indicators that reflected different aspects of schistosomiasis transmission and control. The necessity, feasibility, and sensitivity of each indicator were assessed and the weight value of each indicator determined based on these experts\u0027 judgment. The system included 3 first-order indicators, 7 second-order indicators, and 30 third-order indicators. The 3 first-order indicators were endemic status, control measures, social and environmental factors, with the weight values 0.366, 0.343 and 0.291, respectively. For the 7 second-order indicators, the highest weight value was for control measures for snails (0.175) and the lowest for transmission route (0.110). We estimated and mapped the SEWI for endemic areas at the county scale in Jiangsu Province finding that the majority of the endemic areas were characterized as medium transmission risk (SEWI risk values between 0.3 and 0.6), while areas where transmission interruption had been officially declared showed SEWI values \u003C0.30. A few isolated areas (e.g. endemic islands in the Yangtze River) produced SEWI values \u003E0.60. These estimates are largely in agreement with the endemicity levels based on recent epidemiological surveys. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The SEWI should be useful for estimation of schistosomiasis transmission surveillance, particularly with reference to the elimination of the disease in China.","publish_time":"2014-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Kun; Xu, Jun-Fang; Zhang, Jian-Feng; Li, Wei; He, Jian; Liang, Song; Bergquist, Robert","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce48c5f903bc1435190dd7ddf21612cb0a8b0815.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3976384.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24705352/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0094012","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs1OTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEWI"],"locations":["China","Jiangsu","Yangtze River"],"keyphrases":["Transmission control","schistosomiasis control","order indicators","SEWI values","SEWI risk values","control measures","endemic areas","morbidity control","transmission interruption","transmission route","medium transmission risk","estimation of schistosomiasis transmission surveillance","different aspects of schistosomiasis transmission","weight values","isolated areas","endemic status","endemic islands","sensitive measure capable of gauging transmission risk","low-prevalence areas","Schistosomiasis Early Warning Index","highest weight value","Jiangsu Province","China","lower Yangtze River","goal of elimination","Delphi approach","environmental factors","public health experts","remarkable progress","county scale","endemicity levels","reference","current challenge","recent epidemiological surveys","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","structured communication technique","country","use","snails","majority","rounds of interviews","past decades","agreement","METHODOLOGY","feasibility","sensitivity","BACKGROUND","experts\u0027 judgment","disease","SIGNIFICANCE","necessity","study","CONCLUSIONS","system","estimates"],"language":"en"},

Despite the so-called immunoprivileged status of the nervous system, immunosurveillance plays an important role in the fate of viral infection of the brain. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) persists in the nervous system for the life of the host with periodic stress induced reactivation that produces progeny viruses. Prevention of reactivation requires a complex interplay between virus neurons, and immune response. New evidence supports the view that CD8\u002BT cells employing both lytic granule- and IFN-gamma-dependent effectors are essential in setting up and maintaining HSV-1 latency. HSV-1 infection of the nervous system can be seen as a parasitic invasion which leaves the individual at risk for subsequent reactivation and disease. The recent observation that herpes virus latency may confer protection against experimental bacterial infection suggests that unexpected symbiosis may exist between latent viruses and the infected nervous system of its host.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lafon, M.","journal":"Revue Neurologique","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5916f020de2657de5965127fca8cbe33b5fa376.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118798.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19906390/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003537870900455X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurol.2009.09.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003537870900455X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected nervous system","HSV","latent viruses","herpes virus latency","virus neurons","subsequent reactivation","progeny viruses","host","Herpes simplex virus","Prevention of reactivation","Abstract Viruses","experimental bacterial infection","fate of viral infection","periodic stress induced reactivation","latent infections","CD8","important role","unexpected symbiosis","protection","IFN-gamma","lytic granule","complex interplay","view","T cells","risk","individual","immunosurveillance","life","so-called immunoprivileged status","dependent effectors","recent observation","immune response","New evidence","parasitic invasion","disease","brain"],"language":"en"},

Mortality rates in previously healthy children hospitalized with RSV are \u003C0.5%, but up to 37% in patients with underlying medical conditions. The objective of this study was to characterize factors associated with deaths among children hospitalized with RSV infection in Canadian pediatric centers. METHODS: A retrospective case series of children aged \u226418 years with RSV-associated deaths at centers affiliated with the Pediatric Investigators Collaborative Network on Infections in Canada from 2003\u20132013, inclusive, was performed. Cases were identified using RSV-specific International Classification of Diseases codes to capture deaths where a diagnosis of RSV infection was present. RESULTS: Eleven centers reported 79 RSV-associated deaths. RSV was regarded as primarily responsible for death in 32 cases (40.5%). Median age at death was 11 months (range, \u003C1 month to 16 years). Thirty-nine patients (49.4%) were male. Fourteen patients (17.7%) had no known risk factors for severe RSV infection. Healthcare-associated RSV infections (HAIs) accounted for 29 deaths (36.7%), with RSV judged to be the primary cause of death in 9 of these cases. CONCLUSIONS: RSV-associated deaths were predominantly associated with chronic medical conditions and immunocompromised states among infants; however, 1 in 5 deaths occurred among patients with no known risk factors for severe RSV. Mortality associated with HAI accounted for over a third of cases. These findings highlight patient groups that should be targeted for RSV prevention strategies such as infection control practices, immunoprophylaxis, and future vaccination programs.","publish_time":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tam, Jennifer; Papenburg, Jesse; Fanella, Sergio; Asner, Sandra; Barton, Michelle; Bergeron, Cybele; Desai, Shalini; Hui, Charles; Foo, Cheryl; Langley, Joanne M; Leifso, Kirk; Ma, My-Linh; Pernica, Jeffrey; Robinson, Joan; Singh, Roopi; Tapiero, Bruce; Allen, Upton","journal":"Clin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83c81d2ddae72746a4c2e9f0473ac90bd47a65d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108116.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788036/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV","HAI"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["RSV-associated deaths","severe RSV infection","diagnosis of RSV infection","Healthcare-associated RSV infections","RSV prevention strategies","patients","Cases","RSV-specific International Classification of Diseases codes","healthy children","known risk factors","infection control practices","Canadian pediatric centers","primary cause of death","years","retrospective case series of children","chronic medical conditions","underlying medical conditions","Mortality rates","major cause of pneumonia","Pediatric Investigators Collaborative Network","immunoprophylaxis","Canada","months","immunocompromised states","HAIs","Respiratory syncytial virus","future vaccination programs","infants","bronchiolitis","BACKGROUND","METHODS","range","Median age","CONCLUSIONS","patient groups","findings","study","RESULTS","objective","male"],"language":"en"},

An experimental BRSV infection model was used to study the pathogenesis of the disease in calves. Broncho alveolar lung lavage (BAL) was performed on 28 Jersey calves, of which 23 were experimentally infected with BRSV and five were given a mock inoculum. The presence of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor \u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) in the BAL fluids was detected and quantified by a capture ELISA. TNF-\u03B1 was detected in 21 of the infected animals. The amount of TNF-\u03B1 in the BAL fluid of calves killed post inoculation day (PID) 2 and 4 was at the same very low level as in the uninfected control animals. Large amounts of TNF-\u03B1 were detected on PID 6, maximum levels of TNF-\u03B1 were reached on PID 7, and smaller amounts of TNF-\u03B1 were seen on PID 8. The high levels of TNF-\u03B1 appeared on the days where severe lung lesions and clinical signs were obvious and the amounts of BRSV-antigen were at their greatest. Although Pasteurellaceae were isolated from some of the BRSV-infected calves, calves treated with antibiotics before and through the whole period of the infection, as well as BRSV-infected calves free of bacteria reached the same level of TNF-\u03B1 as animals from which bacteria were isolated from the lungs. It is concluded that significant quantities of TNF-\u03B1 are produced in the lungs of the calves on PID 6\u20137 of BRSV infection.

Previous efforts by several molecular techniques effectively identified large sequence polymorphisms among BCG daughter strains, but lacked the resolution to identify smaller changes. In this study, we have used a NimbleGen tiling array for whole genome comparison of 13 BCG strains. Using this approach, in tandem with DNA resequencing, we have identified six novel large sequence polymorphisms including four deletions and two duplications in specific BCG strains. Moreover, we have uncovered various polymorphisms in the phoP-phoR locus. Importantly, these polymorphisms affect genes encoding established virulence factors including cell wall complex lipids, ESX secretion systems, and the PhoP-PhoR two-component system. Our study demonstrates that major virulence factors are different among BCG strains, which provide molecular mechanisms for important vaccine phenotypes including adverse effect profile, tuberculin reactivity and protective efficacy.

In past decades, lower population densities, infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics were rare and driven almost exclusively by natural disasters, predatory animals, and war. In the early 1900s, Sir William Osler first advanced the knowledge of zoonotic diseases that are spread from reservoir animals to human animals. Once rare, they now make up 71% or more of new diseases. Globally, zoonotic spread occurs for many reasons. Because the human population has grown in numbers and density, the spread of these diseases accelerated though rapid unsustainable urbanization, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Furthermore, they are exacerbated by an increasing number of vulnerable populations suffering from chronic deficiencies in food, water, and energy. The World Health Organization (WHO) and its International Health Regulation (IHR) Treaty, organized to manage population-based diseases such as Influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), HIV, and Ebola, have failed to meet population-based expectations. In part, this is due to influence from powerful political donors, which has become most evident in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system, nor tolerate the self-serving political interference that authoritarian regimes and others have exercised over the WHO. In a highly integrated globalized world, both the WHO with its IHR Treaty have the potential to become one of the most effective mechanisms for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide. Practitioners and health decision-makers must break their silence and advocate for a stronger treaty, a return of the WHO\u2019s singular global authority, and support highly coordinated population-based management. As Osler recognized, his concept of \u201Cone medicine, one health\u201D defines what global public health is today.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burkle, Frederick M.","journal":"Prehospital and disaster medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27494ad1e1cac61786c4c235c5dc54341181d445.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167298.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32279686/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x20000515","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Osler","William Osler"],"organizations":["World Health Organization","International Health Regulation","Practitioners"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["population-based diseases","population-based care","human population","population-based expectations","global public health","coordinated population-based management","International Health Regulation","World Health Organization","lower population densities","health decision-makers","IHR Treaty","new diseases","human animals","zoonotic spread","large number of health care providers world-wide","knowledge of zoonotic diseases","stronger treaty","reservoir animals","predatory animals","global community","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Middle East respiratory syndrome","coronavirus disease","crisis response","passive international response system","WHO\u2019s singular global authority","current COVID","infectious disease outbreaks","risk reduction world-wide","self-serving political interference","Sir William Osler","powerful political donors","integrated globalized world","increasing number of vulnerable populations","support","SARS","H1N1","Influenza","biodiversity loss","MERS","epidemics","return","rapid unsustainable urbanization","chronic deficiencies","food","silence","effective mechanisms","past decades","water","authoritarian regimes","advocate","natural disasters","HIV","pandemics","numbers","density","experience","climate change","influence","war","Practitioners","Ebola","energy","concept","medicine","reasons","potential"],"language":"en"},

An individual that has contracted the two-stage contagious disease will initially show no symptoms of the disease but is capable of spreading it. If the initial stages are not detected which could lead to complications eventually, then symptoms start appearing in the latter stage when it would be necessary to perform expensive treatment. Under a constrained budget situation, policymakers are faced with the decision of how to allocate budget for prevention (via vaccinations), subsidizing treatment, and examination to detect the presence of initial stages of the contagious disease. These decisions need to be performed in each period of a given time horizon. To aid this decision-making exercise, we formulate a stochastic dynamic optimal control problem with feedback which can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). However, solving the MDP is computationally intractable due to the large state space as the embedded stochastic network cannot be decomposed. Hence we propose an asymptotically optimal solution based on a fluid model of the dynamics in the stochastic network. We heuristically fine-tune the asymptotically optimal solution for the non-asymptotic case, and test it extensively for several numerical cases. In particular we investigate the effect of budget, length of planning horizon, type of disease, population size, and ratio of costs on the policy for budget allocation.","publish_time":"2012-03-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parvin, Hoda; Goel, Piyush; Gautam, Natarajan","journal":"Ann Oper Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/670777b45dae78bb6f9a1b089771e31fb897c10f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087586.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-012-1103-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214587/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs3ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["type of disease","optimal solution","effect of budget","budget allocation","stage contagious diseases","embedded stochastic network","prevention","constrained budget situation","symptoms","MDP","stochastic dynamic optimal control problem","presence of initial stages","subsidizing treatment","expensive treatment","healthcare policy issues","length of planning horizon","given time horizon","Markov decision process","trading","resources","large state space","population size","ratio of costs","testing","feedback","cure","fluid model","examination","non-asymptotic case","dynamics","policymakers","vaccinations","period","paper","decision-making exercise","numerical cases","complications","individual","decisions"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful. METHODS: We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R(0)] of 1\u00B75, 2\u00B70, or 2\u00B75) and assuming 7\u00B75% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R(0) value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22\u00B77%, 30\u00B70%, 40\u00B70%, and 50\u00B70%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures. FINDINGS: For the baseline scenario, when R(0) was 1\u00B75, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279 000 (IQR 245 000\u2013320 000), corresponding to 7\u00B74% (IQR 6\u00B75\u20138\u00B75) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000\u2013776 000) when R(0) was 2\u00B70, corresponding to 19\u00B73% (17\u00B78\u201320\u00B76) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000\u20131 249 000) when R(0) was 2\u00B75, corresponding to 32% (30\u00B79\u201333\u00B71) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99\u00B73% (IQR 92\u00B76\u201399\u00B79) when R(0) was 1\u00B75, by 93\u00B70% (81\u00B75\u201399\u00B77) when R(0) was 2\u00B70, and by 78\u00B72% (59\u00B70 \u221294\u00B74) when R(0) was 2\u00B75. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50\u00B70%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R(0) of 1\u00B75. INTERPRETATION: Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

We also observed the presence of a porcine enterovirus genome with a gene insertion, resembling a C28 peptidase gene found in toroviruses, which was confirmed using re-sequencing, bioinformatics, and proteomics approaches. Moreover, the predicted cleavage sites for the insertion suggest that this gene was being expressed as a single protein, rather than a fused protein. Recombination in enteroviruses has been reported as a major mechanism to generate genetic diversity, but gene insertions across viral families are rather uncommon. Although such inter-family recombinations are rare, our finding suggests that these events may significantly contribute to viral evolution.","publish_time":"2017-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Concei\u00E7\u00E3o-Neto, N\u00E1dia; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Cui, Tingting; Zeller, Mark; Yinda, Claude Kwe; Christiaens, Isaura; Heylen, Elisabeth; Van Ranst, Marc; Carpentier, Sebastien; Nauwynck, Hans J.; Matthijnssens, Jelle","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/485169c3d48f25be33434505f0e9b5ea5c1256f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5591953.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vex024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28924489/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":["Europe","Belgium"],"keyphrases":["gene insertions","viral metagenomics","viral families","viral evolution","C28 peptidase gene","porcine bocavirus","PEDV","potential viral pathogens","enteroviruses","porcine enterovirus genome","Belgium of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","major concerns","major mechanism","pig farms","Diarrhea outbreaks","suspected outbreak","fused protein","single protein","dramatic pig losses","genetic diversity","bioinformatics","finding","re-sequencing","Europe","toroviruses","inter-family recombinations","proteomics approaches","low abundance","predicted cleavage sites","USA","presence","events","sample"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we will focus on recent novel findings that elucidate how respiratory viral infections alter the epithelial barrier in the airways, the upper airway microbial environment, epigenetic modifications including miRNA modulation, and other changes in immune responses throughout the upper and lower airways. First, we reviewed the prevalence of different respiratory viral infections in causing exacerbations in chronic airway inflammatory diseases. Subsequently we also summarized how recent models have expanded our appreciation of the mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbations. Further we highlighted the importance of the virome within the airway microbiome environment and its impact on subsequent bacterial infection.

Methods Thirty-eight clinical samples were collected from 19 patients in an ARTI outbreak that occurred in a physical training facility in January 2013; patient demographic information was also collected. In addition, 60 influenza virus-negative samples from febrile respiratory patients were collected from the same community at the same time to determine whether these were the same infections. Multiplex PCR (multi-PCR) was used to detect the possible pathogen in these samples. All human adenovirus (HAdV)-positive samples were inoculated onto Hep-2 cells for isolation. HAdV isolates were typed by hexon gene, fiber gene, and whole genome sequencing using primers designed in-house and compared to different type/serotype HAdVs downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine the type of the HAdV. Results Of the 38 samples, 34 from 17 cases were HAdV-positive; two of them were co-infected, one with respiratory syncytial virus A and the other with human rhinovirus. The hexon gene open reading frame (ORF; 2841 nucleotides (nt)) and fiber gene ORF (978 nt) were obtained from four HAdV strains (TJ-2013-92, TJ-2013-94, TJ-2013-100, TJ-2013-122) from three upper respiratory infection cases and one pneumonia case. They were all completely identical. One HAdV isolate, TJ-2013-90, was selected for whole genome sequencing; 34238 nt were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed the whole genome of TJ-2013-90 to be clustered together with HAdV-B55/HAdV-B11a. Three of 60 influenza virus-negative specimens were HAdV-positive, but hexon and fiber gene analysis showed that they were grouped in different branches to the HAdV isolates from this outbreak. Conclusions The cause of this ARTI outbreak was HAdV-B55. This was another outbreak caused by this re-emerging virus. Continuous surveillance of respiratory adenovirus is necessary for disease control.","publish_time":"2014-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Xiaoyan; Kong, Mei; Su, Xu; Zou, Ming; Guo, Liru; Dong, Xiaochun; Li, Lin; Gu, Qing","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65a592b6ee1ab68d0158778aa9f71da79fe3499b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128664.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.06.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971214015811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25236387/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971214015811","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs4OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Multiplex PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HAdV-positive","HAdV isolates","HAdV-B55","HAdV-B11a","HAdV strains","genome of TJ","positive samples","ARTI outbreak","fiber gene analysis","fiber gene ORF","respiratory syncytial virus","influenza virus-negative samples","clinical samples","febrile respiratory patients","upper respiratory infection cases","re-emerging virus","genome sequencing","Phylogenetic analysis","acute respiratory tract infection","Continuous surveillance of respiratory adenovirus","influenza virus-negative specimens","hexon gene open reading frame","cause","human adenovirus","different type","different branches","Multiplex PCR","multi-PCR","human rhinovirus","nucleotides","pneumonia case","serotype HAdVs","physical training facility","disease control","patient demographic information","GenBank","primers","addition","Conclusions","cells","isolation","community","Summary Objectives","possible pathogen","Methods","time","Results","infections"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of these studies was to elucidate mechanisms by which host cells regulate the level of virus infection and expression and to assess host cell cytokine responses to virus infection. Cells used for the analyzes included four IL-2-dependent continuous T-cell lines (104-C1, 104-C7, MCH5-4 and DB FeTs) which arose from long-term passage, followed by limiting dilution cloning of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); two IL-2-independent T-cell lines (104-C1DL and MCH5-4DL) which originated from two of the IL-2-dependent lines, 104-C1 and MCH5-4; respectively; Crandell feline kidney cells (CrFK); G355-5 brain-derived glial cells; and the T-cell lymphoma line, 3201. Cells were infected with FIV-PPR, FIV-34TF10, FIV 34TF10orf2rep, and a variant arising from FIV-PPR during ex vivo passage on 104-C1DL cells, termed FIV-PPRglial. Infection of the IL-2-dependent T-cell line, 104-C1, by FIV-PPR resulted in the specific and distinct upregulation of cytokine expression. In particular, these cells doubled their expression of the pleiotropic cytokines, interleukin-4 and interleukin-12 after FIV infection. Interferon-\u03B3 production also increased after infection with FIV whereas, TNF\u03B1 expression remained constant. Also, a marked upregulation of MHC class II expression was noted post infection of MCH5-4 and 104-C1 cells with FIV-PPR. Similar results were obtained after infection with FIV-34TF10orf2rep, indicating that the upregulation of cytokine expression is not an isolate-specific phenomenon. Changes in cytokine and class II expression are similar to various reports for the in vivo cytokine alterations in FIV, SIV and HIV infections. The ex vivo infection of these cell lines offers a manipulable system to examine the mechanism(s) by which lentiviruses alter cytokine expression.","publish_time":"1998-10-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lerner, Danica L.; Grant, Chris K.; de Parseval, Aymeric; Elder, John H.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0087db1b3fdc81bb42d1fc625fc202c881dd9b9f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119630.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242798001627; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242798001627","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Crandell","FIV","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIV infection","FIV 34TF10orf2rep","FIV-34TF10orf2rep","C1 cells","C1DL cells","distinct upregulation of cytokine expression","termed FIV-PPRglial","TNF\u03B1 expression","post infection of MCH5","independent T-cell lines","free feline cell lines","dependent continuous T-cell lines","dependent lines","host cell cytokine responses","level of virus infection","T-cell lymphoma line","cytokine alterations","Crandell feline kidney cells","brain-derived glial cells","dilution cloning of peripheral blood mononuclear cells","distinct specific-pathogen","interleukin","molecular clones of feline immunodeficiency virus","marked upregulation of MHC class","isolate-specific phenomenon","variant arising","Similar results","long-term passage","G355","CrFK","various reports","PBMCs","SIV","tissue culture","manipulable system","DB FeTs","lentiviruses","pleiotropic cytokines","HIV infections","ability","Interferon-\u03B3 production","C7","Changes","studies","mechanisms","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Previous studies revealed that the spike (S) protein of SARS had experienced adaptive evolution, but whether other functional proteins of SARS have undergone adaptive evolution is not known. RESULTS: We employed several methods to investigate selective pressure among different SARS-CoV groups representing different epidemic periods and hosts. Our results suggest that most functional proteins of SARS-CoV have experienced a stepwise adaptive evolutionary pathway. Similar to previous studies, the spike protein underwent strong positive selection in the early and middle phases, and became stabilized in the late phase. In addition, the replicase experienced positive selection only in human patients, whereas assembly proteins experienced positive selection mainly in the middle and late phases. No positive selection was found in any proteins of bat SARS-like-CoV. Furthermore, specific amino acid sites that may be the targets of positive selection in each group are identified. CONCLUSION: This extensive evolutionary analysis revealed the stepwise evolution of different functional proteins of SARS-CoVs at different epidemic stages and different hosts. These results support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV originated from bats and that the spill over into civets and humans were more recent events.","publish_time":"2009-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Xianchun; Li, Gang; Vasilakis, Nikos; Zhang, Yuan; Shi, Zhengli; Zhong, Yang; Wang, Lin-Fa; Zhang, Shuyi","journal":"BMC Evol Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9179c5c9df6bf1ac1aab2f413d18c1954e680fd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2676248.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19261195/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-9-52","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["southern China"],"keyphrases":["protein of SARS","SARS coronavirus","proteins of bat SARS","different SARS-CoV groups","stepwise evolution of different functional proteins of SARS","etiological agent of SARS","strong positive selection","targets of positive selection","different hosts","assembly proteins","RESULTS","different epidemic stages","different epidemic periods","spike protein","stepwise adaptive evolutionary pathway","middle phases","Previous studies","late phases","bats","extensive evolutionary analysis","human patients","human population","extensive investigations","CoVs","wet markets","wildlife animals","selective pressure","southern China","civets","humans","methods","replicase","specific amino acid sites","recent events","spill","CONCLUSION","addition","BACKGROUND","hypothesis","animal source"],"language":"en"},

Of the three enveloped viruses tested, human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 and porcine respiratory corona virus, only HSV-1 proved sensitive to the 3-HP-proteins. All of the chemically modified proteins presented antiviral activity against HSV-1 when assayed before, during or after infection. However, to achieve HSV-1 inhibition, significantly higher concentrations of the modified proteins were required if present before infection as compared to during or after infection. Our results suggest that multiple mechanisms are involved in the inhibition of HSV-1 infection. Proteolytical digestion of albumin, \u03B1-lactalbumin, \u03B2-lactoglobulin and lysozyme by trypsin, chymotrypsin and pepsin yielded several peptide fragments with antiherpetic activity. Chemical modification of these peptide fragments by 3-HP generated peptides with antiviral activity, however, this was almost always combined with a cytotoxic effect on the Vero cells. Overall, our results suggest that targeted chemical modification of some natural products might provide compounds effective against HSV-1 infection.","publish_time":"2003-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oevermann, Anna; Engels, Monika; Thomas, Ursula; Pellegrini, Antonio","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3de860f3fc5297f279aa7e847ae7401dc69c6544.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125565.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016635420300010X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016635420300010X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chemical"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infection","HP-proteins","inhibition of HSV","antiviral activity","proteins bovine serum albumin","antiherpetic activity","targeted chemical modification","Abstract Chemical modification","native unmodified proteins","\u03B1-lactalbumin","bovine parainfluenza virus type","\u03B2-lactoglobulin","peptide fragments","results","HP generated peptides","human herpes simplex virus type","porcine respiratory corona virus","chicken lysozyme","compounds effective","Proteolytical digestion of albumin","natural products","pepsin","chymotrypsin","enveloped viruses","higher concentrations","hydroxyphthalic anhydride","cytotoxic effect","Vero cells","multiple mechanisms","present"],"language":"en"},

The three tryptophans in the peptide are all essential for FPR binding, just as they were essential for antiviral activity (Giannecchini, S. et al., J. Virol. 77 (2003) 3724).

Formyl-NleNleWEDWVGWI behaved as a full agonist toward all three FPRs but exhibited a much higher EC(50) with W190/N192 FPR (300\u00B145 nM) than for R190/K192 FPR (40\u00B13 nM) or R190/N192 (60\u00B18 nM).

MERS-CoV causes disease in humans with thirty-five percent fatality, and has evolved proteins that counteract human antiviral responses. Since bats experimentally infected with MERS-CoV do not develop signs of disease, we tested the hypothesis that MERS-CoV would replicate less efficiently in bat cells than in human cells because of its inability to subvert antiviral responses in bat cells. We infected human and bat (Eptesicus fuscus) cells with MERS-CoV and observed that the virus grew to higher titers in human cells. MERS-CoV also effectively suppressed the antiviral interferon beta (IFN\u03B2) response in human cells, unlike in bat cells. To determine if IRF3, a critical mediator of the interferon response, also regulated the response in bats, we examined the response of IRF3 to poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA. We observed that bat IRF3 responded to poly(I:C) by nuclear translocation and post-translational modifications, hallmarks of IRF3 activation. Suppression of IRF3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) demonstrated that IRF3 was critical for poly(I:C) and MERS-CoV induced induction of IFN\u03B2 in bat cells. Our study demonstrates that innate antiviral signaling in E. fuscus bat cells is resistant to MERS-CoV-mediated subversion.","publish_time":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, Arinjay; Falzarano, Darryl; Rapin, Noreen; Lew, Jocelyne; Misra, Vikram","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/724fa0c1969874d0051c6f86795971aab0054c05.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6410008.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11020152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30781790/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Middle-East"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human cells","bat IRF3","fuscus bat cells","response of IRF3","MERS-CoV induced induction of IFN\u03B2","human antiviral responses","Suppression of IRF3","interferon response","poly","hallmarks of IRF3 activation","innate antiviral","antiviral interferon beta","Insectivorous bats","Eptesicus fuscus","critical mediator","signs of disease","small-interfering RNA","synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA","post-translational modifications","East respiratory syndrome","ancestral hosts of Middle","nuclear translocation","siRNA","proteins","coronavirus","humans","inability","percent fatality","higher titers","mediated subversion","hypothesis","study"],"language":"en"},

Immunological responses against sperm antigens or other elements of the reproductive tract can lead to androgen insufficiency, infertility, or chronic inflammation. Systemic or local immune activation and inflammation directly inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary-Leydig cell axis, interfere with spermatogenic cell development, and may provoke sperm antibody formation. Traditional explanations for protection of spermatogenic cells, based on physical barriers or immune cell exclusion, are not consistent with either the organization of the reproductive tract or modern concepts of immunoregulation. Regulation of immune responses in the male reproductive tract involves immunoregulatory macrophages and lymphocytes, as well as active somatic cell suppression of antigen-specific immunity by anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive factors, including cytokines and androgenic steroids. These restraints on antigen-specific immune mechanisms appear to be counterbalanced by enhanced innate immunity. Finally, inflammatory signaling pathways appear to play an important role in normal male reproductive function, and there is evidence that establishment of male reproduction during development is intimately linked to the maturation of the local immune environment.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hedger, Mark P.","journal":"Knobil and Neill\u0027s Physiology of Reproduction","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f45a0487d294e3c4e3d4dbed5ce4ff03d6fd7c03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158304.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123971753000193; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123971753000193","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["male reproductive tract","immune cell exclusion","immune systems","local immune activation","Regulation of immune responses","local immune environment","normal male reproductive function","antigen-specific immune mechanisms","spermatogenic cell development","Leydig cell axis","specific immunity","establishment of male reproduction","active somatic cell suppression of antigen","chronic inflammation","sperm antigens","Immunological responses","innate immunity","protection of spermatogenic cells","sperm antibody formation","immunosuppressive factors","anti-inflammatory","lymphocytes","important role","physical barriers","hypothalamic-pituitary","androgen insufficiency","close functional relationship","cytokines","evidence","immunoregulatory macrophages","elements","modern concepts of immunoregulation","Traditional explanations","infertility","organization","maturation","restraints","androgenic steroids","pathways","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

Besides pathogens, several noninfectious management factors, especially management around birth, colostrum management, calf housing, feeding, and hygiene are important in the pathogenesis of diarrhea. To date, few data are available concerning calf rearing management on small and medium-sized dairy farms that are typical for Austria and the alpine region. Consequently, the objectives of this case-control study were to evaluate routine calf management practices on Austrian dairy farms and to examine differences in management between farms with and without the presence of calf diarrhea to identify risk factors. Overall, 100 dairy farms were visited. Of these farms, 50 were chosen based on the history and presence of calf diarrhea (case farms). Another 50 farms with no presence of calf diarrhea were chosen to serve as a standard of comparison (control farms). On farms, management was evaluated by face-to-face interview, and health status and hygiene were surveyed. Several calf rearing management procedures were similar on all of the visited farms, especially in areas regulated by national and European law. These factors include colostrum management and feeding. Consequently, no influence of these factors on the appearance of calf diarrhea could be detected. In contrast, other areas such as hygiene measures differed between farms and showed a partial association with the presence of calf diarrhea on farm. Variables related to diarrhea on farm were farm size; that is, the number of cows on farm. Farms with diarrhea cases were larger (median 40 cows, interquartile range 24.5 to 64.0) compared with farms with no presence of diarrhea (median 28 cows, interquartile range 18.8 to 44.0). Other risk factors that influenced the presence of diarrhea were the presence of other farm animal species on the farm [odds ratio (OR) 26.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.64 to 273.5], frequency of cleaning of the calving area (OR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.79), the placement of individual calf housings (barn vs. outdoors; OR 0.02, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.47), and the presence of respiratory tract disease (OR 52.49, 95% CI: 1.26 to 2,181.83). The possible influence of these factors on the appearance of calf diarrhea should be considered when farmers are advised.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klein-J\u00F6bstl, D.; Iwersen, M.; Drillich, M.","journal":"Journal of Dairy Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85bcd7e3c58440cb61593f09e8cae72b2f951463.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094405.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2013-7695; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030214003798; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030214003798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881793/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Austria"],"keyphrases":["presence of calf diarrhea","presence of diarrhea","appearance of calf diarrhea","Abstract Calf diarrhea","control farms","case farms","visited farms","diarrhea cases","pathogenesis of diarrhea","Austrian dairy farms","routine calf management practices","colostrum management","noninfectious management factors","management procedures","medium-sized dairy farms","placement of individual calf housings","risk factors","farm size","presence of respiratory tract disease","farm animal species","areas","number of cows","hygiene measures","interquartile range","case-control study","important problems","possible influence","birth","barn","outdoors","face-to-face interview","differences","partial association","health status","calving area","odds ratio","data","frequency of cleaning","alpine region","European law","objectives","standard of comparison","pathogens","history","confidence interval","date","contrast","Variables","farmers"],"language":"en"},

For years, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell culture and antigen detection, but since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques in the clinical setting, identification of these pathogens has increased and new microorganisms such as human bocavirus have been discovered. In general, influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus are still the main pathogens involved in this entity. However, in recent years, outbreaks of deadly coronavirus and zoonotic influenza virus have demonstrated the need for constant alert in the face of new emerging pathogens. Neuraminidase inhibitors for viral pneumonia have been shown to reduce transmission in cases of exposure and to improve the clinical progress of patients in intensive care; their use in common infections is not recommended. Ribavirin has been used in children with syncytial respiratory virus, and in immunosuppressed subjects. Apart from these drugs, no antiviral has been shown to be effective. Prevention with anti-influenza virus vaccination and with monoclonal antibodies, in the case of syncytial respiratory virus, may reduce the incidence of pneumonia.","publish_time":"2015-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Galv\u00E1n, Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa; Rajas, Olga; Aspa, Javier","journal":"Arch Bronconeumol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130696.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25957460/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2015.02.015","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["case of syncytial respiratory virus","zoonotic influenza virus","influenza virus type","main pathogens","diagnosis of viral pneumonia","incidence of pneumonia","anti-influenza virus vaccination","viral infection","clinical setting","clinical picture","face of new emerging pathogens","upper respiratory tract symptoms","clinical progress of patients","new microorganisms","common infections","recent years","co-infection","significant number of community","outbreaks of deadly coronavirus","intensive care","introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques","need","monoclonal antibodies","leukocytes","fever","constant alert","cell culture","geriatric populations","antigen detection","different pneumonias","identification","Prevention","children","procalcitonin levels","immunosuppressed subjects","cases of exposure","human bocavirus","transmission","Neuraminidase inhibitors","antiviral","entity","bacteria","drugs","Ribavirin","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there is no specific treatment approved for FIP despite the importance of FIP as the leading infectious cause of death in young cats. During the replication process, coronavirus produces viral polyproteins that are processed into mature proteins by viral proteases, the main protease (3C-like [3CL] protease) and the papain-like protease. Since the cleavages of viral polyproteins are an essential step for virus replication, blockage of viral protease is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Previously, we reported the generation of broad-spectrum peptidyl inhibitors against viruses that possess a 3C or 3CL protease. In this study, we further evaluated the antiviral effects of the peptidyl inhibitors against feline coronaviruses, and investigated the interaction between our protease inhibitor and a cathepsin B inhibitor, an entry blocker, against feline coronaviruses in cell culture. Herein we report that our compounds behave as reversible, competitive inhibitors of 3CL protease, potently inhibited the replication of feline coronaviruses (EC(50) in a nanomolar range) and, furthermore, the combination of cathepsin B and 3CL protease inhibitors led to a strong synergistic interaction against feline coronaviruses in cell culture systems.","publish_time":"2013-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kim, Yunjeong; Mandadapu, Sivakoteswara Rao; Groutas, William C.; Chang, Kyeong-Ok","journal":"Antiviral Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df579575e205bcb94b108aaafb35adbdbb0ad36b.json; document_parses/pdf_json/889d2e3e95ce2bbe7af6877c11d010ef71239942.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3563934.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.11.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354212002604; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354212002604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23219425/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protease inhibitors","replication of feline coronaviruses","main protease","Feline coronavirus infection","blockage of viral protease","feline infectious peritonitis virus","variant of feline enteric coronavirus","virus replication","viral proteases","competitive inhibitors","cleavages of viral polyproteins","cathepsin B inhibitor","importance of FIP","generation of broad-spectrum peptidyl inhibitors","replication process","combination of cathepsin B","cell culture systems","leading infectious cause of death","systemic infection","young cats","strong synergistic interaction","fatal disease of cats","essential step","entry blocker","FIPV","attractive target","exotic felid species","mature proteins","asymptomatic enteritis","FECV","antiviral effects","therapeutic intervention","compounds","specific treatment","papain","nanomolar range","study"],"language":"en"},

In spite of exhaustive studies and widely different diagnosis among returned patients, some cases of febrile illnesses remain without an etiological diagnosis, suggesting that these cases could be due to viral respiratory tract infections. From August 2005 to October 2006, 118 febrile patients without a specific diagnosis in their first visit at the Center for International Health of the Hospital Cl\u00EDnic of Barcelona were included. In all of them, in order to study respiratory viruses, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected. Clinical and radiological features and epidemiological data, as well as other samples for microbiologic studies, were also collected during consultation. Based on the physician\u0027s judgment at the time of consultation, patients were classified into four groups: respiratory symptoms (62%), febrile syndrome with nonspecific symptoms (24%), digestive symptoms (10%), and patients presenting both respiratory and digestive symptoms (4%). A pathogen microorganism was detected in 61 patients (52%). Respiratory viruses were detected in 44 out of 118 (37%) travelers included in the study, representing 56% of the patients with respiratory symptoms. The most frequently viruses detected were influenza virus (38%), rhinovirus (23%), adenovirus (9%), and respiratory syncytial virus (9%). Respiratory viruses have been shown to play an important role in imported fever. In light of the fact that international tourism is an increasing phenomenon, new strategies to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses should be considered, specially for influenza when a vaccine is available.

The expression of B0AT1 in kidney was recently shown to depend on its association with collectrin (Tmem27), a protein homologous to the membrane-anchoring domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2. Methods Because collectrin is almost absent from small intestine, we tested the hypothesis that it is ACE2 that interacts with B0AT1 in enterocytes. Furthermore, because B0AT1 expression depends on an associated protein, we tested the hypothesis that Hartnup-causing B0AT1 mutations differentially impact on B0AT1 interaction with intestinal and kidney accessory proteins. Results Immunofluorescence, coimmunoprecipitation, and functional experiments using wild-type and ace2-null mice showed that expression of B0AT1 in small intestine critically depends on ACE2. Coexpressing new and previously identified Hartnup disorder\u2013causing missense mutations of B0AT1 with either collectrin or ACE2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that the high-frequency D173N and the newly identified P265L mutant B0AT1 transporters can still be activated by ACE2 but not collectrin coexpression. In contrast, the human A69T and R240Q B0AT1 mutants cannot be activated by either of the associated proteins, although they function as wild-type B0AT1 when expressed alone. Conclusions We thus show that ACE2 is necessary for the expression of the Hartnup transporter in intestine and suggest that the differential functional association of mutant B0AT1 transporters with ACE2 and collectrin in intestine and kidney, respectively, participates in the phenotypic heterogeneity of human Hartnup disorder.","publish_time":"2009-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Camargo, Simone M.R.; Singer, Dustin; Makrides, Victoria; Huggel, Katja; Pos, Klaas M.; Wagner, Carsten A.; Kuba, Keiji; Danilczyk, Ursula; Skovby, Flemming; Kleta, Robert; Penninger, Josef M.; Verrey, Fran\u00E7ois","journal":"Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1013cd932609e52386c3ab7fe07b6c95f6398f3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094282.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2008.10.055; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508508018933; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0016508508018933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19185582/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxNDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Background \u0026 Aims Hartnup"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of B0AT1","B0AT1 expression","B0AT1 mutations","B0AT1 interaction","wild-type B0AT1","missense mutations of B0AT1","Hartnup amino acid transporter B0AT1","R240Q B0AT1 mutants","Hartnup transporter","identified P265L mutant B0AT1 transporters","differential functional association of mutant B0AT1 transporters","identified Hartnup disorder","ace2-null mice","collectrin coexpression","kidney accessory proteins","phenotypic heterogeneity of human Hartnup disorder","major luminal sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter of small intestine","kidney proximal tubule","hypothesis","associated proteins","functional experiments","human A69T","protein homologous","SLC6A19","membrane-anchoring domain of angiotensin","Xenopus laevis oocytes","high-frequency D173N","coimmunoprecipitation","enzyme","Tmem27","Coexpressing new","Background","Results Immunofluorescence","contrast","Methods","enterocytes","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

The inconsistency might be due to inaccurate identification of cases of infection and different methods of categorizing service volumes. This study takes coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgical site infections (SSIs) as an example to examine whether a relationship exists between operation volumes and SSIs, when different SSIs case identification, definitions and categorization methods of operation volumes were implemented. METHODS: A population-based cross-sectional multilevel study was conducted. A total of 7,007 patients who received CABG surgery between 2006 and 2008 from19 medical centers in Taiwan were recruited. SSIs associated with CABG surgery were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM) codes and a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model. Two definitions of surgeon and hospital operation volumes were used: (1) the cumulative CABG operation volumes within the study period; and (2) the cumulative CABG operation volumes in the previous one year before each CABG surgery. Operation volumes were further treated in three different ways: (1) a continuous variable; (2) a categorical variable based on the quartile; and (3) a data-driven categorical variable based on k-means clustering algorithm. Furthermore, subgroup analysis for comorbidities was also conducted. RESULTS: This study showed that hospital volumes were not significantly associated with SSIs, no matter which definitions or categorization methods of operation volume, or SSIs case identification approaches were used. On the contrary, the relationships between surgeon\u2019s volumes varied. Most of the models demonstrated that the low-volume surgeons had higher risk than high-volume surgeons. CONCLUSION: Surgeon volumes were more important than hospital volumes in exploring the relationship between CABG operation volumes and SSIs in Taiwan. However, the relationships were not robust. Definitions and categorization methods of operation volume and correct identification of SSIs are important issues for future research.","publish_time":"2015-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Tsung-Hsien; Tung, Yu-Chi; Chung, Kuo-Piao","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f3cbc0503581249a834895fc94cd3bae24714a0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4459823.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0129178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26053035/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Regression Trees","CABG"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["hospital operation volumes","cumulative CABG operation volumes","hospital volumes","categorization methods of operation volumes","Surgeon volumes","surgeon\u2019s volumes","CABG surgery","different methods of categorizing service volumes","correct identification of SSIs","different SSIs case identification","SSIs case identification approaches","Volume-infection relationships","definitions of surgeon","study period","categorical variable","low-volume surgeons","inaccurate identification of cases","different ways","cross-sectional multilevel study","Taiwan","continuous variable","important issues","high-volume surgeons","surgical site infections","high-risk surgical procedures","International Classification of Diseases","coronary artery bypass graft","Revision","higher risk","Regression Trees","year","ICD","Clinical Modification","CART","conclusions","codes","from19 medical centers","future research","population","matter","example","patients","BACKGROUND","subgroup analysis","comorbidities","inconsistency","models","quartile","data","total","RESULTS","algorithm"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Onsite evaluation of 16 hospitals consisted of interviews with managers and health care workers about RPPs and practices, review of written RPPs, and limited observations of personnel using respirators. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: All hospitals had implemented policies requiring the minimum use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators when working with patients with H1N1 virus infection; 95.5% of health care workers (n = 199) reported they would wear at least this level of protection when in close contact with a patient with confirmed or suspected H1N1 virus infection. However, evaluation of written RPPs indicated deficiencies in required areas, most commonly in recordkeeping, designation of a program administrator, program evaluation, employee training, and fit testing procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers were aware of respiratory protection required when providing care for patients with confirmed or suspected H1N1 virus infection. Hospitals should improve written RPPs, fully implement written procedures, and conduct periodic program evaluation to ensure effectiveness of respirator use for health care worker protection. Increased accessibility of resources tailored for hospital respirator program administrators may be helpful.","publish_time":"2013-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beckman, Stella; Materna, Barbara; Goldmacher, Suzi; Zipprich, Jennifer; D\u2019Alessandro, Maryann; Novak, Debra; Harrison, Robert","journal":"American Journal of Infection Control","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6008f2262f07f43ae8391384e5fa2d99bd1fae8c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3bb350b565dbdabcca5d2fea3068a797658f0477.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4615716.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4615716?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655313008900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23932825/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2013.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655313008900","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["California Department of Public Health"],"locations":["California"],"keyphrases":["evaluation of written RPPs","health care workers","health care worker protection","review of written RPPs","periodic program evaluation","suspected H1N1 virus infection","written procedures","Onsite evaluation","hospitals","evaluation of hospital respiratory protection programs","level of protection","aware of respiratory protection","hospital respirator program administrators","California Department of Public Health","practices","patients","effectiveness of respirator use","required areas","influenza season","minimum use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators","fit testing procedures","employee training","interviews","managers","policies","recordkeeping","close contact","limited observations of personnel","novel","deficiencies","Increased accessibility of resources","designation","CONCLUSIONS","Emergence","METHODS","Data","descriptive statistics","BACKGROUND","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This was a population-based, retrospective study from 2013 to 2015. Specimens were analyzed by molecular methods. This analysis was performed using the database of Virology Unit, Mubarak Al-Kabeer Hospital. Data from 1510 admitted patients with suspected respiratory viral infections was extracted. RESULTS: The database contained a total of 39 (2.6%) patients infected with PIV (53.8% male and 46.2% females) and 20 (51.3%) were under 1 year of age. The most frequently isolated type was type 3 (28, 71.8%) followed by type 1 (9, 23.1%).

This faciliates dissemination to susceptible tissues where it can develop a vigorous and sustained replication, to eventually target specific organs from which it can propagate into the environment and efficiently infect new hosts, closing the merry-go-round of the virus cycle.","publish_time":"2012-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Backovic, Marija; Rey, Felix A","journal":"Curr Opin Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/35348144c8dcb8a192d861ade6c29f86ac6a60b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102732.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2011.12.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187962571100191X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22440960/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187962571100191X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxOTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus cycle","field of virus entry","RSV","infection of epithelial cells","missing measles virus","infection of dendritic cells","interactions of MV","new information","entry receptors","new hosts","epithelial barrier","rubella","sindbis","respiratory syncytial viruses","RV","DC-SIGN","phleboviruses","crucial step","access","merry-go-round","sustained replication","susceptible tissues","major developments","faciliates dissemination","specific organs","lymph nodes","environment","addition"],"language":"en"},

Sputum examination can be useful in diagnosing the cause of pneumonia in adults but is less well established in children. We sought to assess the diagnostic utility of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of respiratory viruses and bacteria in induced sputum (IS) specimens from children hospitalized with severe or very severe pneumonia. METHODS. Among children aged 1\u201359 months, we compared organism detection by multiplex PCR in IS and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens. To assess whether organism presence or density in IS specimens was associated with chest radiographic evidence of pneumonia (radiographic pneumonia), we compared prevalence and density in IS specimens from children with radiographic pneumonia and children with suspected pneumonia but without chest radiographic changes or clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of pneumonia (nonpneumonia group). RESULTS. Among 4232 cases with World Health Organization\u2013defined severe or very severe pneumonia, we identified 1935 (45.7%) with radiographic pneumonia and 573 (13.5%) with nonpneumonia. The organism detection yield was marginally improved with IS specimens (96.2% vs 92.4% for NP/OP specimens for all viruses combined [P = .41]; 96.9% vs 93.3% for all bacteria combined [P = .01]). After accounting for presence in NP/OP specimens, no organism was detected more frequently in the IS specimens from the radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases. Among high-quality IS specimens, there were no statistically significant differences in organism density, except with cytomegalovirus, for which there was a higher quantity in the IS specimens from cases with radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases (median cycle threshold value, 27.9 vs 28.5, respectively; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS. Using advanced molecular methods with IS specimens provided little additional diagnostic information beyond that obtained with NP/OP swab specimens.","publish_time":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thea, Donald M.; Seidenberg, Phil; Park, Daniel E.; Mwananyanda, Lawrence; Fu, Wei; Shi, Qiyuan; Baggett, Henry C.; Brooks, W.

Then, we provided a simple and cost effective way for the annotation of nuclear non-coding and mitochondrial genes and the identification of new steady RNAs, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Using 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sRNAs, the annotation of human mitochondrial was corrected and a novel ncRNA named non-coding mitochondrial RNA 1 (ncMT1) was reported for the first time in this study. We also found that most of human tRNA genes have downstream lncRNA genes as lncTRS-TGA1-1 and corrected the misunderstanding of them in previous studies. Using 5\u2032, 3\u2032, and intronic sRNAs, we reported for the first time that enzymatic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) cleavage and RNA interference (RNAi) might be involved in the RNA degradation and gene expression regulation of U1 snRNA in human. We provided a different perspective on the regulation of gene expression in U1 snRNA. We also provided a novel view on cancer and virus-induced diseases, leading to find diagnostics or therapy targets from the ribonuclease III (RNase III) family and its related pathways.

The consequence of human infection varies markedly among different subtypes of avian influenza viruses. In addition to viral factors, the difference in host cellular response is likely to play a critical role. This study aims at elucidating how avian influenza infection perturbs the host\u2019s miRNA regulatory pathways that may lead to adverse pathological events, such as cytokine storm, using the miRNA microarray approach. RESULTS: The results showed that dysregulation of miRNA expression was mainly observed in highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 infection. We found that miR-21*, miR-100*, miR-141, miR-574-3p, miR-1274a and miR1274b were differentially expressed in response to influenza A virus infection. Interestingly, we demonstrated that miR-141, which was more highly induced by H5N1 than by H1N1 (p \u003C 0.05), had an ability to suppress the expression of a cytokine - transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B22. This was supported by the observation that the inhibitory effect could be reversed by antagomiR-141. CONCLUSIONS: Since TGF-\u03B22 is an important cytokine that can act as both an immunosuppressive agent and a potent proinflammatory molecule through its ability to attract and regulate inflammatory molecules, and previous report showed that only seasonal influenza H1N1 (but not the other avian influenza subtypes) could induce a persistent expression of TGF-\u03B22, we speculate that the modulation of TGF-\u03B22 expression by different influenza subtypes via miR-141 might be a critical step for determining the outcome of either normal or excessive inflammation progression.","publish_time":"2013-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lam, Wai-Yip; Yeung, Apple Chung-Man; Ngai, Karry Lei-Ka; Li, Man-Shan; To, Ka-Fai; Tsui, Stephen Kwok-Wing; Chan, Paul Kay-Sheung","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d5be5a4268da7c08b478ca36721d46bd67bbe69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3663648.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663545/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-13-104","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["avian influenza infection","avian influenza subtypes","pathogenic avian influenza","different influenza subtypes","\u03B22 expression","TGF-\u03B22","different subtypes of avian influenza viruses","seasonal influenza H1N1","persistent expression of TGF","H5N1 infection","dysregulation of miRNA expression","virus infection","modulation of TGF","consequence of human infection","cytokine storm","important cytokine","ability","RESULTS","miRNA microarray approach","host\u2019s miRNA regulatory pathways","human health","critical step","critical role","host cellular response","difference","previous report","serious threat","outcome","potent proinflammatory molecule","adverse pathological events","viral factors","growth factor","immunosuppressive agent","inflammatory molecules","elucidating","excessive inflammation progression","inhibitory effect","addition","study","BACKGROUND","observation","antagomiR","miR1274b","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

In 975 of these outpatients, PCR and/or serology for adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus A and rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were performed. Treatment data were extracted for a subgroup of 138 patients. Descriptive statistics, including Kaplan\u2013Maier curves were generated. Yearly incidence ranged between 1.4 and 2.1% per population in the two cities. Adult patients sought medical attention only after a median of 3 weeks of coughing. Irrespective of smoking and unrelated to the identified pathogens, the median duration of coughing was 6 weeks, with an interquartile range of 4\u201311 weeks. In 48.3% of patients, possible pathogens were identified, among which adenovirus (15.1%), RSV (7.5%), B. pertussis (5.6%), and influenza viruses (4.0%) were most often found. Symptoms were not indicative of a specific agent and a total of 64% of patients received antibiotics. Prolonged adult coughing requiring medical attention prompts substantial healthcare use.

Most people attempt to minimize contact with others, and move themselves to avoid crowds. This dispersal may be adaptive regarding the intensity of media coverage and the population numbers in different patches. We propose an epidemic model with such adaptive dispersal rates to examine how appropriate adaption can facilitate disease control in connected groups or patches. Assuming dependence of the adaptive dispersal on the total population in the relevant patches, we derived an expression for the basic reproduction number R 0 to be related to the intensity of media coverage, and we show that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 \u003C 1 , and it becomes unstable if R 0 \u003E 1 . In the unstable case, we showed a uniform persistence of disease by using a perturbation theory and the monotone dynamics theory. Specifically, when the disease mildly affects the dispersal of infectious individuals and rarely induces death, a unique endemic equilibrium exists in the model, which is globally asymptotically stable in positive states. Moreover, we performed numerical calculations to explain how the intensity of media coverage causes competition among patches, and influences the final distribution of the population.","publish_time":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Chang-Yuan","journal":"Applied Mathematical Modelling","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/007d75e45cc9d79a93133918808dc9e86476b8ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125817.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287941/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apm.2017.03.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X17301531; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0307904X17301531","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["intensity of media coverage","adaptive dispersal rates","disease control","communicable disease","relevant patches","different patches","total population","population numbers","uniform persistence of disease","dispersal of infectious individuals","epidemic model","people","perturbation theory","basic reproduction number R","disease-free equilibrium","unstable case","monotone dynamics theory","unique endemic equilibrium","expression","appropriate adaption","death","connected groups","outbreaks","competition","Abstract","final distribution","positive states","numerical calculations","dependence","contact","crowds"],"language":"en"},

Epidemiological surveys revealed that IDV is distributed worldwide among livestock and that IDV-directed antibodies are detected in humans with occupational exposure to livestock. To identify the transmission capability of IDV to humans, we determined the viral replication kinetics and cell tropism using an in vitro respiratory epithelium model of humans. The inoculation of IDV revealed efficient replication kinetics and apical progeny virus release at different body temperatures. Intriguingly, the replication characteristics of IDV revealed higher replication kinetics compared to Influenza C virus, despite sharing the cell tropism preference for ciliated cells.

To solve the presented problem effectively and efficiently, a multi-objective genetic algorithm is proposed to achieve high-quality schedules for various factors such as contact rate and transition rate of symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined infected class. By changing the contact rate and the transition rate of symptomatic infected individuals to the quarantined infected class, two optimal policies are designed. This study has two main scientific contributions that are: (1) This is pioneer research that proposes policies regarding COVID-19, (2) This is also the first research that addresses COVID-19 and considers its economic consequences through a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Numerical simulations conspicuously demonstrate that by applying optimal policies, governments could find useful and practical ways for control of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yousefpour, Amin; Jahanshahi, Hadi; Bekiros, Stelios","journal":"Chaos, solitons, and fractals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1ddb1b64f285dd85a9d6fa82f817440ba7e499e4.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109883; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920302836; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920302836?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427205/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["optimal policies","contact rate","COVID","transition rate of symptomatic infected individuals","quarantined infected class","effectiveness of control policies","design of optimal control strategies","study","research","multi-objective evolutionary algorithm","multi-objective genetic algorithm","early transmission dynamics of diseases","prevention of epidemic diseases","estimation","inevitable roles","practical ways","economic consequences","governments","novel coronavirus","mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV","high-quality schedules","various factors","Wuhan\u0027s data","main scientific contributions","Abstract","paper","presented problem","Numerical simulations","end"],"language":"en"},

This compound efficiently protects cells against various toxins and pathogens including viruses, intracellular bacteria and parasite. ABMA provokes Rab7-positive late endosomal compartment accumulation in mammalian cells without affecting other organelles (early endosomes, lysosomes, the Golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic reticulum or the nucleus).

RESULTS: A total of 163 patients were included in the full analysis set (FAS) and 151 patients were included in the per-protocol set (PPS). After 7 days of treatment, ORR of clinical symptoms was higher in IFN\u03B11b group than that in control group for both the FAS and PPS. Moreover, after 7 days of treatment, the daily score of three efficacy indexes including expectoration, respiratory rate, and pulmonary rales were improved.

Its 95 amino acids are divided into two structural domains (SD), the first spanning amino acids 1\u201348 (SD1) and the second 49\u201395 (SD2). Interestingly, the domains are nearly identical but differ in their affinities for carbohydrates. With the aim of enhancing understanding of the binding properties of scytovirin, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of scytovirin complexed with Man4. We set up three systems: (i) Man4 bound to both domains (SD1 \u002B SD2) using the full-length protein; (ii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein, containing only SD1 and (iii) Man4 bound to an incomplete protein containing only SD2. Contrary to other reports, binding free energy results suggest that Man4 can bind simultaneously to SD1 and SD2 binding regions, but SD1 individually has the best values of energy and the best affinity for Man4. Decomposition of the binding free energy showed that the residues that interact with Man4 were different in the three systems, suggesting that the binding mechanism of Man4 varies between full-length protein, SD1 and SD2. The results presented here may help to formulate strategies to use scytovirin and promote mutagenesis studies to improve the antiviral activity of scytovirin.","publish_time":"2017-07-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siqueira, Andrei Santos; Lima, Alex Ranieri Jer\u00F4nimo; de Souza, Rafael Concei\u00E7\u00E3o; Santos, Alberdan Silva; Vianez J\u00FAnior, Jo\u00E3o L\u00EDdio da Silva Gon\u00E7alves; Gon\u00E7alves, Evonnildo Costa","journal":"Mol Biol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b9f90c37d0dca4e2f389333472a5dff18a39f64f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088960.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-017-4116-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28756560/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SD1","binding mechanism of Man4","binding properties of scytovirin","SD2 binding regions","binding free energy","full-length protein","simulations of scytovirin","incomplete protein","antiviral activity of scytovirin","free energy results","best values of energy","structural domains","systems","spanning amino acids","best affinity","SARS coronavirus","HIV","molecular dynamics","residues","Zaire Ebola virus","mutagenesis studies","cyanobacterium Scytonema varium","lectin","MD","reports","understanding","Decomposition","affinities","strategies","aim","carbohydrates"],"language":"en"},

Two forms are described: the superficial form and the deep form, or angioedema. In young children aged under 3 years, urticaria is commonly annular and ecchymotic, and is mistaken for erythema multiforme or acute hemorrhagic edema. Serum sickness-like reaction is a particular form of urticaria characterized by angioedema of the extremities, fever and arthralgia, and it is chiefly drug-induced (cephalosporins). With children, questioning and clinical examination are essential and, in most cases, reveal an etiology. The main causes of acute or recurrent urticaria are viral infections and/or drugs (non-specific histamine release), whereas chronic urticaria is mostly due to physical causes. In developed countries, parasitic infections are rarely the cause. Arguments in favor of a food allergy are as follows: a setting of atopy, onset within one hour of taking the suspect food, absence of fever or infection, a duration of less than 24 hours, possible association with other signs of anaphylaxis, and further recurrence with each new intake of the suspect food. First-line treatment of urticaria without signs of severity consists solely of non-sedating antihistamine (associated with removal of the cause where the latter has been determined). Nearly one-third of cases of urticaria in children progress over a prolonged period of more than 6 weeks, thus constituting chronic urticaria (most often a form of mild recurrent urticaria during episodes of infection and/or medication). Chronic urticaria is very rarely due to an underlying inflammatory disease or a genetic disease such as cryopyrinopathy, and first-line etiological assessment is usually limited to the following tests: CBC, sedimentation speed and/or CRP, and transaminases.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boralevi, F.; L\u00E9aut\u00E9-Labr\u00E8ze, C.","journal":"Rev Fr Allergol (2009)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa0b038fe869a066953dddcefc8b1204859dbebc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185918.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877032020303134; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877032020303134","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic urticaria","cases of urticaria","particular form of urticaria","line treatment of urticaria","form of mild recurrent urticaria","cumulative incidence of urticaria","superficial form","deep form","children progress","suspect food","young children","food allergy","angioedema","main causes of acute","signs of severity","viral infections","episodes of infection","genetic disease","signs of anaphylaxis","parasitic infections","absence of fever","physical causes","acute hemorrhagic edema","underlying inflammatory disease","line etiological assessment","sedimentation speed","drugs","non-specific histamine release","reaction","following tests","erythema multiforme","prolonged period","non-sedating antihistamine","CBC","removal","arthralgia","hours","possible association","recurrence","cryopyrinopathy","new intake","weeks","years","extremities","chiefly drug","setting of atopy","onset","CRP","developed countries","Arguments","favor","clinical examination","duration","ecchymotic","Serum sickness","cephalosporins","medication","forms","transaminases","etiology"],"language":"en"},

NDV strains are classified into three major pathotypes: velogenic, mesogenic, and lentogenic. Avian influenza viruses (AIV) are also divided into: low pathogenic (LPAI) and highly pathogenic (HPAI) strains. Both viruses are enveloped, single stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses which give similar symptoms ranging from sub-clinical infections to severe disease, including loss in egg production, acute respiratory syndrome, and high mortality, depending on their level of pathogenicity. This similarity hinders diagnosis when based solely on clinical and post mortem examination. Most of the currently available molecular detection methods are also pathogenspecific, so that more than one RT-PCR is then required to confirm or exclude the presence of both pathogens. To overcome this disadvantage, we have applied a One Step Duplex RT-PCR method to distinguish between those two pathogens. The main objective of the project was to develop a universal, fast, and inexpensive method which could be used in any veterinary laboratory.","publish_time":"2013-03-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nidzworski, Dawid; Smietanka, Krzysztof; Minta, Zenon; Szewczyk, Bogus\u0142aw","journal":"Cent Eur J Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/86b25f6daeeb952b927c53a104fd46e0a91573a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215119/; https://doi.org/10.2478/s11535-013-0164-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Newcastle","NDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Avian influenza viruses","main avian pathogens","NDV strains","Newcastle disease Virus","Step Duplex RT-PCR method","severe disease","negative-sense RNA viruses","Orthomyxoviridae family","Paramyxoviridae family","inexpensive method","main objective","sub-clinical infections","loss","similar symptoms","acute respiratory syndrome","serious economic problems","egg production","high mortality","major pathotypes","velogenic","mesogenic","available molecular detection methods","pathogenspecific","poultry farming","LPAI","member","project","post mortem examination","HPAI","AIV","level of pathogenicity","lentogenic","diagnosis","veterinary laboratory","similarity","presence","disadvantage"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to characterize viral replication and pathogenesis in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs infected simultaneously with the two types of PEDV using two recombinant PEDVs: icPC22A and its S1 NTD-del form icPC22A-S1\u0394197. Additionally, viral replication was compared in Vero and IPEC-DQ cells at the presence of bovine mucin (BM), porcine gastric mucin (PGM), swine bile and bile acids during inoculation. In the pigs coinfected with icPC22A and icPC22A-S1\u0394197, icPC22A replicated to a higher peak titer than its infection of pigs without the presence of icPC22A-S1\u0394197. The severity of diarrhea and intestinal atrophy were similar between icPC22A and the coinfection groups, but were significantly higher than icPC22A-S1\u0394197 group. In Vero and IPEC-DQ cells, certain concentrations of BM, PGM, bile and bile acids increased significantly the infectivity of icPC22A but had no or negative effects on icPC22A-S1\u0394197. These results indicated that the replication of the S-intact PEDV was enhanced during coinfection in piglets. This observation may be explained partially by the fact that mucin, bile and bile acids in gastrointestinal tract had facilitating effects on the infection of S-intact PEDV, but no/inhibition effects on S1 NTD-del PEDV.","publish_time":"2019-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Su, Yunfang; Hou, Yixuan; Wang, Qiuhong","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30487cd3a38587e8854be79b70b7205d7dac54fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117446.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593369/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518310575; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518310575; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.11.025","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["presence of icPC22A","infectivity of icPC22A","S-intact PEDV","form icPC22A-S1\u0394197","icPC22A-S1\u0394197 group","bile acids","types of PEDV","intact S protein","swine bile","S1 NTD","infection of S","infection of pigs","infected pigs","viral replication","neonatal gnotobiotic pigs","PGM","IPEC-DQ cells","porcine gastric mucin","presence of bovine mucin","S1 subunit of spike","inhibition effects","negative effects","Vero","severity of diarrhea","recombinant PEDVs","coinfection groups","Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","certain concentrations of BM","higher peak titer","variants","N-terminal domain","large deletion","gastrointestinal tract","intestinal atrophy","pathogenesis","inoculation","fact","farms","piglets","results","observation"],"language":"en"},

However, the mechanism through which SSc acts against HBV remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of SSc mediated anti-HBV activity. METHODS: HepG2.2.15 cells were cultured at 37 \u2103 in the presence of 1\u201340 \u03BCg/mL of SSc or DMSO as a control. The expression profile of HBV markers, cytokines, HNF1\u03B1 and HNF4\u03B1 were investigated by real-time quantitative PCR, Elisa, Western blot and Dot blotting. Knockdown of HNF1\u03B1 or HNF4\u03B1 in HepG2.2.15 cells was mediated by two small siRNAs specifically targeting HNF1\u03B1 or HNF4\u03B1. RESULTS: We found that SSc stimulates IL-6 expression, leading to attenuated HNF1\u03B1 and HNF4\u03B1 expression, which further mediates suppression of HBV pgRNA synthesis. Knockdown of HNF1\u03B1 or HNF4\u03B1 in HepG2.2.15 cells by RNA interference abrogates SSc\u2019s anti-HBV role. Moreover, SSc is effective to both wild-type and drug-resistant HBV mutants. CONCLUSION: SSc inhibits pgRNA synthesis by targeting HNF1\u03B1 and HNF4\u03B1. These results indicate that SSc acts as a promising compound for modulating pgRNA transcription in the therapeutic strategies against HBV infection.

From January 2002 to December 2007, a total of 1108 Shigella isolates including 362 S. sonnei were recovered from diarrhea patients at the 302nd Hospital in Beijing. While the frequency of S. flexneri gradually decreased, S. sonnei gradually increased and became the dominant species. A total of 362 S. sonnei isolates were further analyzed for their antimicrobial profiles and 272 revived isolates were selected for genotyping analysis, respectively. High-level antimicrobial resistances were observed in sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (94.5%), ampicillin (40.3%), piperacillin (36.5%), and ceftriaxone (12.8%) with significant single- and multiple-drug resistance increase trends from 2002 to 2007 (P = 0.0000). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that 263 (96.7%) S. sonnei belonged to 1 clonal genotype A, which were further divided into A1\u2013A6 subtypes. While subtype A2 was dominant in the early stage of study years, subtype A4 started to emerge and increased significantly in later years. Antimicrobial resistance rates are statistically different among the 6 subtypes (P = 0.0000), and A4 possessed the highest resistance rates to ampicillin (83.7%) and piperacillin (81.4%). Subtype A3 was highly clustered in inpatients compared to other subtypes (P = 0.0145). This study indicates that a clonal S. sonnei strain has become dominant in the Beijing area, and subtype A4 is responsible for increased antibiotic resistance.","publish_time":"2012-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qu, Fen; Bao, Chunmei; Chen, Suming; Cui, Enbo; Guo, Tongsheng; Wang, Huan; Zhang, Juling; Wang, Han; Tang, Yi-Wei; Mao, Yuanli","journal":"Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c97ea6628c10bcbdbc07269c62be6c82dbd414f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127854.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22858547/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889312002775; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889312002775; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2012.06.026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shigella"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["sonnei isolates","sonnei strain","subtype A4","Antimicrobial resistance rates","increased antibiotic resistance","Abstract Shigella sonnei","Shigella isolates","highest resistance rates","dominant serotype","subtype A2","revived isolates","Subtype A3","dominant species","antimicrobial profiles","Beijing area","multiple-drug resistance","increasing trend of antibiotic resistance profiles","early stage of study years","recent years","ampicillin","later years","A6 subtypes","total","piperacillin","High-level antimicrobial resistances","genotyping analysis","clonal genotype","field gel electrophoresis analysis","shigellosis","Asian countries","genotypes","inpatients","sulfamethoxazole","trends","diarrhea patients","trimethoprim","Hospital","flexneri","frequency","ceftriaxone"],"language":"en"},

In 2013\u20132014, the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreak led to $900 million to $1.8 billion in annual losses to US swine producers. Passive lactogenic immunity remains the most promising and effective way to protect neonatal suckling piglets from enteric diseases like PEDV. Protecting suckling piglets through lactogenic immunity is dependent on trafficking of pathogen-specific IgA plasmablasts to the mammary gland and accumulation of secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies in milk, defined as the gut-mammary-sIgA axis. Due to an impermeable placenta, piglets are born agammaglobulinic, and are highly susceptible to a plethora of infectious agents. They rely solely on colostrum and milk antibodies for maternal lactogenic immunity. Previous advances in the development of live and attenuated vaccines for another devastating diarrheal virus of pigs, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), provide insights into the mechanisms of maternal immunity and piglet protection. In this chapter, we will review previous research on TGEV-induced lactogenic immunity to provide a historical perspective on current efforts for PEDV control and vaccines in the swine industry. Identifying factors that influence lactogenic immunity and the gut-mammary-sIgA axis may lead to improved vaccine regimens for PEDV and other enteric pathogens in gestating swine and improved overall herd immunity, swine health and industry productivity.","publish_time":"2016-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Langel, Stephanie N.; Paim, Francine Chimelo; Lager, Kelly M.; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Saif, Linda J.","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27b2c6072c3f0ea86e1cb4c527a825e73a56cc4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111331.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170216302155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27212686/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170216302155","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["maternal lactogenic immunity","Passive lactogenic immunity","swine industry","mechanisms of maternal immunity","gestating swine","swine health","improved overall herd immunity","neonatal suckling piglets","US swine producers","enteric diseases","PEDV control","gut-mammary","sIgA axis","neonatal piglets cost swine producers millions of dollars","enteric pathogens","mammary gland","TGEV","industry productivity","milk antibodies","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","devastating diarrheal virus of pigs","attenuated vaccines","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","loss of productivity","previous research","Previous advances","specific IgA plasmablasts","improved vaccine regimens","accumulation of secretory IgA","trafficking of pathogen","historical perspective","current efforts","development of live","effective way","insights","mortality","agammaglobulinic","annual losses","piglet protection","outbreak","colostrum","plethora of infectious agents","Abstract Morbidity","impermeable placenta","chapter","factors"],"language":"en"},

A self-reporting questionnaire was used to investigate the attitudes, awareness, satisfaction, and methods regarding health promotion practices of primary healthcare professionals. Results: Of the 206 primary healthcare professionals surveyed, 58.1% reported awareness of health promotion programs conducted in the hospitals and 64.6% reported that the health promotion system in the hospitals needs to be improved. Language barriers and cultural beliefs were viewed as obstacles to carrying out effective health promotion by 65% and 64.6% of primary healthcare professionals, respectively.

Interspecies interactions of the nasopharyngeal microbiota are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of acute otitis media (AOM). Capturing the breadth of microbial interactions requires a detailed description of the microbiota during health and AOM. Methods. The nasopharyngeal microbiota of 163 infants with (n = 153) or without (n = 10) AOM was characterized using nasopharyngeal swabs and multiplexed pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected during 4 winter seasons from 2004 through 2010 for infants with AOM and during 2010 for controls. Results. Fifty-eight bacterial families were identified, of which Moraxellaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Pasteurellaceae were the most frequent. Commensal families were less prevalent in infants with AOM than in controls. In infants with AOM, prior exposure to antimicrobials and administration of the heptavalent conjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PCV7) were also associated with reduced prevalence of distinct commensal families (Streptococcaceae and Corynebacteriaceae).

In vivo and in vitro models of demyelinating diseases. III. JHM virus infection of rats. Arch Neurol 1980; 37: 478-84. Two types of studies were conducted to ascertain the involvement of the cellular immune system in development of resistance. Immunosuppression of WL rats with cyclosporin A (CsA) following onset of the age-related resistance demonstrated that this drug was partially able to abrogate resistance. In the other studies nude (rnu/rnu) rats, their heterozygous (rnu/\u002B) litter mates and genetically related LE rats of various ages were challenged with JHMV. The rnu/\u002B and LE animals became completely resistant before the age of weaning, whereas some rnu/rnu rats, challenged as late as 70 days of age, showed disease symptoms\u2014albeit after a long latent period. These observations indicated that the cellular immune system plays an important role in suppressing the disease process in the CNS. When the infection of nude rats was initiated on or after the 15th day of life, the histological lesions were generally small and present in both grey and white matter but were seldom seen in the spinal cord. Mononuclear infiltrates were evident throughout the CNS. In some nude rats there was massive mononuclear cell infiltration towards the meningies and into ventricular spaces. By contrast in rnu/\u002B, LE and WL rats with late-onset disease symptoms, demyelinating-type lesions were confined to the white matter and only minor infiltration of mononuclear cells was evident. JHMV RNA was detectable by dot-blotting analysis in the CNS of both paralysed and asymptomatic rnu/rnu and rnu/\u002B rats, but less RNA was usually detected in heterozygous animals. In-situ hybridization with cDNA probes for JHMV RNA showed that neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum, as well as cells in the white matter, were frequently infected. The present data indicate that in the rat T cells have an important function in maintaining resistance to the JHMV related disease process. However, even without a functional T cell compartment nude rats challenged after 15 days of age did not develop an acute encephalitis, suggesting that an age-dependent, non-immunological mechanism is also involved in restricting the spread of infection. It is possible that resistance in euthymic rats sets in because: (1) at the time of weaning the CNS matures, so that the number of targets available for infection is reduced, (2) T cells prevent the late-onset disease by clearing persistent, low grade infections from the CNS.","publish_time":"1987-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sorensen, O.; Saravani, A.; Dales, S.","journal":"Microbial Pathogenesis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53cd3849209a86c8b9224f507946358777909031.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0882401087901008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0882401087901008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Wistar Lewis","Dales S."],"organizations":["CNS","WL","JHMV","JHMV RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["rnu rats","infection of nude rats","CNS disease","euthymic rats","asymptomatic rnu","Immunosuppression of WL rats","JHM virus infection of rats","rats of various ages","JHMV RNA","JHMV related disease process","functional T cell compartment nude rats","late-onset disease symptoms","complete resistance","age-related resistance","development of resistance","days of age","day of age","age of weaning","rat T cells","age-dependent","white matter","studies nude","minor infiltration of mononuclear cells","spread of infection","massive mononuclear cell infiltration","cellular immune system","Mononuclear infiltrates","heterozygous animals","demyelinating-type lesions","important role","important function","histological lesions","rat strains","murine hepatitis JHM virus","Long Evans","present data","day of life","types of studies","long latent period","models of demyelinating diseases","meningies","cDNA probes","dot-blotting analysis","Dales","neurons","low grade infections","cyclosporin","CsA","situ hybridization","Sorensen O","Percy D","non-immunological mechanism","Abstract Wistar Lewis","involvement","drug","litter mates","number of targets available","hippocampus","cerebellum","observations","acute encephalitis","ventricular spaces","spinal cord","Arch Neurol","time","contrast"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of TGF-\u03B2 expression in acute hantavirus infection. RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 77 patients hospitalised with acute Puumala infection during a hantavirus epidemic in Germany in 2012. Hantavirus infection was confirmed by positive anti-Puumala hantavirus IgG and IgM. Plasma levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03B21 and TGF-\u03B22 were analysed. Based on glomerular filtration rate on admission, patients were divided in mild and severe course of disease. Puumala virus RNA was detected by PCR amplification of the viral L segment gene. Out of 77 Puumala virus infected patients, 52 (68%) were male. A seasonal distribution was detected in our cohort with a peak in summer 2012, the highest incidence was observed in the age group of 30\u201339 years. Puumala virus RNA was detectable in 4/77 cases. Patients with severe disease had a significant longer hospital stay than patients with mild disease (6.2 vs 3.6 days). Thrombocyte count (186 vs 225 per nl), serum TGF-\u03B21 (74 vs 118 ng/l) and TGF-\u03B22 (479 vs 586 pg/l) were significantly lower in severe compared to mild disease. However, C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in patients with severe disease (62 vs 40 mg/l). TGF-\u03B21/Cr was the most sensitive and specific marker associated with renal dysfunction. CONCLUSION: High serum CRP and low serum TGF-\u03B2 in the early phase of hantavirus infection is associated with a severe course of disease.

The significant advantages of Luminex xMAP technology are high-throughput, high parallel and automation. This study aimed to establish a liquid bead array based on Luminex xMAP technology that was able to simultaneously detect multiple insect-borne pathogens. METHODS: Specific probes and primers to detect the nucleic acid of 10 insect-borne pathogens were designed. Probes were coupled with fluorescent carboxylated microspheres. The parameters of the system were optimized, including ratio of forward/reverse primers (1:2), hybridization temperature (50 \u00B0C) and duration (30 min) and quantity of PCR product (2 \u03BCl). The sensitivity and specificity of the system were also evaluated. Moreover mixed nucleic acid of 10 insect-borne pathogens, including Bluetongue virus, Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus of deer, Coxiella burnetii, African swine fever virus, West Nile fever virus, Borrelia burgdorferi, vesicular stomatitis virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Ebola virus and Schmalenberg\u2019s disease virus, and 3000 clinical samples were tested for practicability. RESULTS: The optimized detection system showed high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility. Each probe showed specific fluorescence signal intensity without any cross-hybridization for the other insect-borne pathogens tested, which included dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Xinjiang hemorrhagic fever virus, spotted fever group rickettsiae, ehrlichiae and chikungunya virus. The limit of detection was 10 copies of target gene. Insect-borne pathogens were successfully detected among the 3000 clinical samples, and the results were consistent with those obtained using gold-standard assays or commercial nucleic acid detection kits. CONCLUSIONS: This optimized liquid array detection system was high-throughput and highly specific and sensitive in screening of the insect-borne pathogens. It was promising in detection of these pathogens for molecular epidemiological studies.

As the infection rates rise, a growing number of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals have been reported to complain of olfactory disturbances at an alarming rate. Postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) is a well-known phenomenon that may explain the olfactory dysfunction reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Methods A scoping literature review was performed to identify studies that investigated the mechanisms of postviral olfactory dysfunction. Studies demonstrating pathophysiological, histological, immunochemical, and epidemiological outcomes of PVOD were included. Results Fourteen studies were included in addition to one international news article. Three studies reported destruction of the olfactory epithelium following intranasal inoculation of various viral strains in mice. Three studies isolated pathogenic, anosmia inciting viruses (Parainfluenza virus, Human Coronavirus, Rhinovirus) through nucleic acid amplification. Eleven studies demonstrated female predilection in patients with PVOD and COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction, of which the majority were over 50 years old. Conclusions PVOD and COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction demonstrates considerable similarities in epidemiological trends and disease sequela of other viruses to suggest identical pathophysiological mechanisms. Further studies such as intranasal inoculation and histological biopsies are needed to support our hypothesis.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imam, Sarah A.; Lao, Wilson P.; Reddy, Priyanka; Nguyen, Shaun A.; Schlosser, Rodney J.","journal":"World Journal of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b57e2165d3240b6037138cdba43c8e23e35bbdb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wjorl.2020.05.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095881120300640; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095881120300640","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["studies","associated olfactory dysfunction","olfactory epithelium","olfactory disturbances","mechanisms of postviral olfactory dysfunction","SARS-CoV","COVID","Conclusions PVOD","epidemiological outcomes of PVOD","viruses","Coronavirus Disease","growing number of SARS","identical pathophysiological mechanisms","epidemiological trends","Human Coronavirus","disease sequela","Parainfluenza virus","histological biopsies","positive individuals","infected individuals","intranasal inoculation of various viral strains","considerable similarities","Rhinovirus","addition","anosmia","patients","female predilection","nucleic acid amplification","mice","majority","destruction","well-known phenomenon","scoping literature review","international news article","Methods","infection rates","alarming rate","Abstract Background","years old","globe","Results","hypothesis"],"language":"en"},

Like other coronaviruses, PEDV makes use of a large, trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein to mediate membrane fusion and gain entry into host cells. Despite the importance of the spike protein in viral entry and host immune responses, high-resolution structural information concerning this large macromolecular machine has been difficult to obtain. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the PEDV S protein in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.1 \u00C5. Our studies revealed that the sialic acid-binding domain at the N terminus of the S1 subunit has an orientation that is substantially different from that observed in the previously determined spike structure from human alphacoronavirus NL63. We also observed dissociated S1 subunit trimers wherein the putative receptor-binding domains exist in a conformation differing from that observed in the intact spike proteins, suggesting that the PEDV receptor-binding domain undergoes conformational rearrangements akin to those that have been described in the related betacoronaviruses. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the biological processes that mediate alphacoronavirus attachment, receptor engagement, and fusion triggering while also identifying a source of conformational heterogeneity that could be manipulated to improve PEDV vaccine antigens. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus spike proteins are large, densely glycosylated macromolecular machines that mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion to facilitate entry into host cells. This report describes the atomic-resolution structure of the spike protein from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, a pathogenic alphacoronavirus that causes severe agricultural damage. The structure reveals a novel position for the sialic acid-binding attachment domain in the intact spike. We also observed shed fusion-suppressive capping subunits that displayed the putative receptor-binding domain in an accessible conformation. These observations provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive the earliest stages of alphacoronavirus infection and will inform future efforts to rationally design vaccines.","publish_time":"2019-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wrapp, Daniel; McLellan, Jason S.","journal":"J Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b2903114784318062dabce86e330fbbe9309aa8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6854500.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00923-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31534041/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV","PEDV S"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["receptor binding","PEDV receptor-binding domain","trimeric spike","determined spike structure","intact spike proteins","putative receptor-binding domains","sialic acid-binding domain","alphacoronavirus attachment","PEDV S protein","sialic acid-binding attachment domain","receptor engagement","pathogenic alphacoronavirus","membrane fusion","IMPORTANCE Coronavirus spike proteins","fusion triggering","host cells","human alphacoronavirus NL63","atomic-resolution structure","PEDV vaccine antigens","earliest stages of alphacoronavirus infection","large macromolecular machine","viral entry","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","prefusion conformation","accessible conformation","report","cryo-electron microscopy structure","host immune responses","shed fusion-suppressive capping subunits","dissociated S1 subunit trimers","glycosylated macromolecular machines","infection of neonatal piglets","conformational rearrangements akin","severe agricultural damage","source of conformational heterogeneity","high-resolution structural information","biological processes","high mortality rate","economic impact","N terminus","glycoprotein","novel position","molecular mechanisms","new insights","future efforts","basis","data","orientation","studies","vaccines","related betacoronaviruses","observations"],"language":"en"},

SUMOylation substrates from Bombyx mori cells infected with this baculovirus were isolated by immunoprecipitation and identified by LC\u2013ESI-MS/MS. A total of 68 candidate SUMOylated proteins were identified, of which 59 proteins were functionally categorized to gene ontology (GO) terms. Analysis of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways showed that 46 of the identified proteins were involved in 76 pathways that mainly play a role in metabolism, spliceosome and ribosome functions, and in RNA transport. Furthermore, SUMOylation of four candidates (polyubiquitin-C-like isoform X1, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cyclin-related protein FAM58A-like and GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran) were verified by co-immunoprecipitation in Drosophila schneide 2 cells. In addition, 74% of the identified proteins were predicted to have at least one SUMOylation site.

Hepatitis C virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation and a vaccine is not available. Hepatitis C virus displays a narrow host species tropism, naturally infecting only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and resulted in the current pandemic. In fact, due to this restricted host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immune control and prophylactic vaccine development. Recently, several studies discovered new viruses related to hepatitis C virus, belonging to the hepaci- and pegivirus genera, in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domesticated animals which live in close contact with humans (dogs and horses). Genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses infecting different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis C virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using tractable animal models. In this review article, we start with an introduction on the genetic diversity of hepatitis C virus and then focus on the newly discovered viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus.

Currently, the role of cellular TRIM22 in PRRSV infection remains unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of TRIM22 on PRRSV replication in vitro and explored the underlying mechanism. Ectopic expression of TRIM22 impaired the viral replication, while TRIM22-RNAi favored the replication of PRRSV in MARC-145 cells. Additionally, we observed that TRIM22 deletion SPRY domain or Nuclear localization signal (NLS) losses the ability to inhibit PRRSV replication. Finally, Co-IP analysis identified that TRIM22 interacts with PRRSV nucleocapsid (N) protein through the SPRY domain, while the NLS2 motif of N protein is involved in interaction with TRIM22. Although the concentration of PRRSV N protein was not altered in the presence of TRIM22, the abundance of N proteins from simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and murine lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) diminished considerably with increasing TRIM22 expression.

We examine how pleiotropic mutations that have antagonistic effects (i.e., antibody evasion vs. receptor binding) on viral replication within hosts can impact viral immune escape in the host population. When the host population is vaccinated, the virus escapes from passive immunity by mutations in the antibody-binding region on the surface of the target protein. However, the reduced ability of the antibody to bind the virus is often accompanied by a reduced ability of the virus to bind the cell receptor because the antibody-binding region overlaps with the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The types of permitted mutations are limited. To investigate the causal relation between a mutation in a viral genome and adaptive evolution of a viral population, we developed a mathematical model that describes the population dynamics of viruses, antibodies, and normal/infected cells within a host. The coefficients describe the binding affinity between the virus and the induced antibody and that between the virus and its receptor. Our knowledge-based index enables us to estimate the effect of a mutation in a binding region on the binding affinity. Using population genetic theory, we evaluated the probability that a mutant is fixed in a host population. The mutations that can be fixed with high probabilities may determine how long a vaccine remains effective. We simulate the adaptive evolution of coronavirus, the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and show that some of mutations in the RBD may have high fixation probabilities in the vaccinated host population.","publish_time":"2010-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Watabe, Teruaki; Kishino, Hirohisa","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a69d7201e40dfdad69b0319d749365f627c375e7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7187634.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msq056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20194425/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral population","receptor binding","antibody-binding region","vaccinated host population","binding affinity","receptor-binding domain","viral replication","viral genome","Viral fitness","antibody evasion","induced antibody","virus escapes","population dynamics of viruses","population genetic theory","pleiotropic mutations","cell receptor","viral immune escape","types of permitted mutations","hosts","high probabilities","RBD","reduced ability","adaptive evolution of coronavirus","high fixation probabilities","etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome","antibodies","antagonistic effects","surface","passive immunity","mathematical model","infected cells","probability","mutant","target protein","causal relation","knowledge-based index","vaccine","transmission","coefficients"],"language":"en"},

A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding the benefits and risks is required. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion is effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS The protocol was pre-published with the Center for Open Science and can be accessed here: osf.io/dwf53 We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database and trials registries to identify ongoing studies and results of completed studies on 23 April 2020 for case-series, cohort, prospectively planned, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA We followed standard Cochrane methodology and performed all steps regarding study selection in duplicate by two independent review authors (in contrast to the recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group). We included studies evaluating convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies including populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) and studies evaluating standard immunoglobulins. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed recommendations of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group regarding data extraction and assessment. To assess bias in included studies, we used the assessment criteria tool for observational studies, provided by Cochrane Childhood Cancer. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at hospital discharge, improvement of clinical symptoms (7, 15, and 30 days after transfusion), grade 3 and 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight studies (seven case-series, one prospectively planned, single-arm intervention study) with 32 participants, and identified a further 48 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma (47 studies) or hyperimmune immunoglobulin (one study), of which 22 are randomised. Overall risk of bias of the eight included studies was high, due to: study design; small number of participants; poor reporting within studies; and varied type of participants with different severities of disease, comorbidities, and types of previous or concurrent treatments, including antivirals, antifungals or antibiotics, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and respiratory support. We rated all outcomes as very low certainty, and we were unable to summarise numerical data in any meaningful way. As we identified case-series studies only, we reported results narratively. Effectiveness of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 The following reported outcomes could all be related to the underlying natural history of the disease or other concomitant treatment, rather than convalescent plasma. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge All studies reported mortality. All participants were alive at the end of the reporting period, but not all participants had been discharged from hospital by the end of the study (15 participants discharged, 6 still hospitalised, 11 unclear). Follow-up ranged from 3 days to 37 days post-transfusion. We do not know whether convalescent plasma therapy affects mortality (very low-certainty evidence). Improvement of clinical symptoms (assessed by respiratory support) Six studies, including 28 participants, reported the level of respiratory support required; most participants required respiratory support at baseline. All studies reported improvement in clinical symptoms in at least some participants. We do not know whether convalescent plasma improves clinical symptoms (very low-certainty evidence). Time to discharge from hospital Six studies reported time to discharge from hospital for at least some participants, which ranged from four to 35 days after convalescent plasma therapy. Admission on the intensive care unit (ICU) Six studies included patients who were critically ill. At final follow-up the majority of these patients were no longer on the ICU or no longer required mechanical ventilation. Length of stay on the ICU Only one study (1 participant) reported length of stay on the ICU. The individual was discharged from the ICU 11 days after plasma transfusion. Safety of convalescent plasma for people with COVID-19 Grade 3 or 4 adverse events The studies did not report the grade of adverse events after convalescent plasma transfusion. Two studies reported data relating to participants who had experienced adverse events, that were presumably grade 3 or 4. One case study reported a participant who had moderate fever (38.9 \u00B0C). Another study (3 participants) reported a case of severe anaphylactic shock. Four studies reported the absence of moderate or severe adverse events (19 participants). We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of moderate to severe adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events One study (3 participants) reported one serious adverse event. As described above, this individual had severe anaphylactic shock after receiving convalescent plasma. Six studies reported that no serious adverse events occurred. We are very uncertain whether or not convalescent plasma therapy affects the risk of serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS: We identified eight studies (seven case-series and one prospectively planned single-arm intervention study) with a total of 32 participants (range 1 to 10). Most studies assessed the risks of the intervention; reporting two adverse events (potentially grade 3 or 4), one of which was a serious adverse event. We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma is effective for people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 as studies reported results inconsistently, making it difficult to compare results and to draw conclusions. We identified very low-certainty evidence on the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma therapy for people with COVID-19; all studies were at high risk of bias and reporting quality was low. No RCTs or controlled non-randomised studies evaluating benefits and harms of convalescent plasma have been completed. There are 47 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, of which 22 are RCTs, and one trial evaluating hyperimmune immunoglobulin. We will update this review as a living systematic review, based on monthly searches in the above mentioned databases and registries. These updates are likely to show different results to those reported here.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valk, Sarah J; Piechotta, Vanessa; Chai, Khai Li; Doree, Carolyn; Monsef, Ina; Wood, Erica M; Lamikanra, Abigail; Kimber, Catherine; McQuilten, Zoe; So-Osman, Cynthia; Estcourt, Lise J; Skoetz, Nicole","journal":"The Cochrane database of systematic reviews","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32406927/; https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013600","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Open Science","World Health Organization","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article Database","Cochrane Childhood Cancer","ICU"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["included studies","ongoing studies","observational studies","case-series studies","Cochrane COVID","results of completed studies","convalescent plasma therapy","BACKGROUND Convalescent plasma","Effectiveness of convalescent plasma","Prevention COVID","study selection","hyperimmune immunoglobulin transfusion","Study Register","study design","Disease Control","all-cause mortality","disease severity","certainty of evidence","Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group","standard Cochrane methodology","varied type of participants","small number of participants","low-certainty evidence","following reported outcomes","respiratory support","hospital discharge","following outcomes","treatment of people","low certainty","different severities of disease","respiratory virus diseases","Cochrane Childhood Cancer","days post-transfusion","single-arm intervention study","recommendations","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome","coronavirus diseases","SEARCH METHODS","data extraction","trials registries","numerical data","SELECTION CRITERIA","DATA COLLECTION","randomised controlled trials","MAIN RESULTS","Research Article Database","Global Research Database","serious adverse events","assessment criteria tool","current body of evidence","poor reporting","GRADE approach","reporting period","concomitant treatment","potential therapy","standard immunoglobulins","Overall risk of bias","SARS","Embase","Centers","antivirals","antifungals","corticosteroids","duplicate","steps","MEDLINE","MERS","patients","independent review authors","concurrent treatments","types of previous","protocol","hydroxychloroquine","antibiotics","comorbidities","contrast","improvement of clinical symptoms","benefits","age","gender","World Health Organization","ANALYSIS","populations","Open Science","thorough understanding","underlying natural history","ethnicity","dwf53","meaningful way","RCTs","cohort","risks","OBJECTIVES","Follow-up","participants","convalescent plasma transfusion","harms of convalescent plasma","severe adverse events","grade of adverse events","safety of convalescent plasma therapy","risk of serious adverse events","non-randomised studies","ICU","case study","risk of moderate","people","COVID","hospital","case of severe anaphylactic shock","Improvement of clinical symptoms","level of respiratory support","absence of moderate","moderate fever","different results","days","case-series","Time","individual","Length","high risk of bias","reporting quality","AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS","living systematic review","effectiveness","monthly searches","total","intensive care unit","mentioned databases","Admission","trial","final follow-up","majority","updates","baseline","hyperimmune immunoglobulin","registries","mechanical ventilation","range"],"language":"en"},

The main psychoactive component of cannabis, the delta-9-tetrahydrocanabinol, can cross the placental barrier, is present in breastmilk and diffuses in the brain. It interacts with the endocannabinoid signaling, especially through the activation of cannabinoid receptors 1 CB1R, which can lead to abnormal neurodevelopmental processes and neuronal circuits functions. Therefore, exposure to cannabis in utero, in perinatal phase, as well as during the adolescence disrupts the brain maturation and can cause disturbances on the cognitive, psychotic and addictive levels that persist far beyond the period of exposure. Several factors modulate the risk of such complications, but studies performed in animal models as well as in human cohorts have shown that exposure during both the critical perinatal and adolescence phases is a risk factor per se.

To our knowledge, this is the first report describing viremia due to HPIV-1. After administering mogamulizumab, lymphocyte count in the blood was drastically decreased and the patient suffered from complicated infections including gram-negative bacterial sepsis, cytomegalovirus antigenemia and aspergillosis. Although these infections were successfully controlled by broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy, patchy ground-grass opacities in the both lungs were gradually worsened. He finally died due to acute respiratory failure. Since findings of the chest CT was consistent with typical patterns of viral pneumonia, we screened major respiratory viruses in the peripheral blood with multiplex PCR, and it turned out that RNA of HPIV-1 was positive. Although ATL cells were not detected in the autopsied lungs and a variety of other tissues, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which are commonly observed in RNA viral infection, were abundantly observed in the autopsied lung tissue. These findings suggest that mogamulizumab accomplished complete remission of ATL, while the chemotherapy-induced prolonged lymphopenia caused fatal pneumonia and viremia due to HPIV-1. As it has been well recognized that community respiratory viruses including HPIV-1 often cause fatal pneumonia in patients with leukemia, but also there is no specific treatment for HPIV-1, we have to enforce standard precautions especially when we treat leukemic patients with intensively immunosuppressive agents such as mogamulizumab.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tamaki, Keita; Kinjo, Takeshi; Aoyama, Hajime; Tomoyose, Takeaki; Nakachi, Sawako; Hanashiro, Taeko; Shimabukuro, Natsuki; Tedokon, Iori; Morichika, Kazuho; Nishi, Yukiko; Taira, Naoya; Fujita, Jiro; Yoshimi, Naoki; Fukushima, Takuya; Masuzaki, Hiroaki","journal":"Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9205667cdec5ab68e043b62502652139f5418056.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129467.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiac.2015.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231316/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1341321X15001543; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1341321X15001543","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mogamulizumab","RNA of HPIV","viremia","case of fatal pneumonia","typical patterns of viral pneumonia","major respiratory viruses","community respiratory viruses","findings","ATL cells","autopsied lungs","report","complete remission of ATL","acute respiratory failure","RNA viral infection","peripheral blood","complicated infections","leukemic patients","year-old male patient","autopsied lung tissue","adult T-cell leukemia","gram-negative bacterial sepsis","patchy ground-grass opacities","broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy","lymphoma","human parainfluenza virus type","cytomegalovirus antigenemia","tissues","chest CT","variety","chemotherapy","prolonged lymphopenia","aspergillosis","immunosuppressive agents","cytoplasmic inclusion bodies","brand-new therapeutic agent","multiplex PCR","knowledge","lymphocyte count","standard precautions","specific treatment"],"language":"en"},

Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point. Methods Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC). Results In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were 3 deaths (17.8 \u00B1 10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and 1 serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p \u003C 0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients. Conclusion Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI. Despite the confounding factors, this suggests that therapy time in anti-cytokine randomized trials will be key.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quartuccio, Luca; Sonaglia, Arianna; McGonagle, Dennis; Fabris, Martina; Peghin, Maddalena; Pecori, Davide; Monte, Amato De; Bove, Tiziana; Curcio, Francesco; Bassi, Flavio; Vita, Salvatore De; Tascini, Carlo","journal":"Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fa1f6da66c89794b6eb3720de5d1bf9c4dd3079e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425662/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104444; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301864?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301864","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TOCI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TOCI ventilated patients","ventilated TOCI cases","TOCI group","non-ventilated TOCI patients","severe cases","Anti-cytokine treatments","higher markers","standard of care patients","consecutive hospitalized patients","higher neutrophils","anti-cytokine randomized trials","cytokine storm","higher baseline CRP","anti-viral therapy","Conclusion Higher inflammatory markers","COVID","serious bacterial superinfection","bacterial complications","SOC","raised CRP","therapy time","life-threatening pneumonia","lower lymphocyte levels","single centre retrospective study","infections","adverse prognostic features","worse outcomes","noninvasive ventilation","tocilizumab","optimal patient selection","setting of increased inflammation","elevations","improvement","groups","ward","aim","fatalities","coronavirus disease","confounding factors","Abstract Objective","ventilators","Results","fatality","deaths","days","point","glucocorticoids","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, an anti-infective treatment which should be both effective and safe for the mother and the unborn child is often required.

In selected cases of bacterial resistance or intolerance to first-line antibiotics, other anti-infective agents might be recommended. Especially for life-threatening infections, a therapy with not so well-tried agents might be needed.

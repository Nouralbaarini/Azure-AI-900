Evaluating pneumonia etiology among malnourished children may help improve empiric treatment guidelines. METHODS: During April 2015\u2014December 2017, we conducted a case-control study among severe acute malnourished (SAM) children aged \u003C5 years admitted to the Dhaka hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). We enrolled hospital admitted SAM children with clinical or radiological pneumonia as cases (during April 2015 to March 2017) and hospital admitted SAM children without any respiratory symptom in the past 10 days before admission as controls (during February 2016 to December 2017). We tested nasopharyngeal wash from both case and control for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza viruses, human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV), rhinovirus and adenovirus by singleplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. To identify the independent association of pneumonia with viral pathogens during February 2016 to March 2017, we used multivariable logistic regression for calculating adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: We enrolled 360 cases and 334 controls. For case and control the median age was 8 months (IQR: 5\u201313) and 11 months (IQR: 6\u201318) (p = 0.001) respectively. Weight/age Z-score was -4.3 (SD \u00B10.7) for cases and -4.1 (SD \u00B11.1) for controls (p = 0.01). Among cases 68% had both clinical and radiological pneumonia, 1% had clinical pneumonia and 31% had only radiological pneumonia. Respiratory virus detection was high in cases compared to controls [69.9% (251) vs. 44.8% (148), p = 0.0001]. The most frequently detected viruses among cases were rhinoviruses (79, 22.0%) followed by RSV (32, 8.9%), adenovirus (23, 6.4%), HPIV (22, 6.1%), influenza virus (16, 4.5%), and HMPV (16, 4.5%). Among the controls, rhinoviruses (82, 24.8%) were most commonly detected one followed by adenovirus (26,7.9%), HMPV (5, 1.5%), HPIV (4, 1.2%), RSV (3, 0.9%), and influenza virus (2, 0.6%). RSV (OR 13.1; 95% CI: 1.6, 106.1), influenza virus (OR 8.7; 95% CI: 1.0, 78.9), HPIV (3.8; 95% CI: 1.0, 14.8), and HMPV (2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.5) were independently associated with pneumonia while compared between 178 cases and 174 controls. CONCLUSION: Viral etiology of pneumonia in SAM children were mainly attributable to RSV, influenza, HPIV and HMPV. Our study findings may help in planning further studies targeting vaccines or drugs against common respiratory viruses responsible for pneumonia among SAM children.","publish_time":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chowdhury, Fahmida; Shahid, Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayeem Bin; Ghosh, Probir Kumar; Rahman, Mustafizur; Hassan, Md.

The efficient and soluble expression of biologically functional recombinant CVN (rCVN) is still an obstacle due to insufficient yield, aggregation, and abnormal modification. Here, we describe an improved approach to preparing native rCVN from Escherichia coli more efficiently. A fusion gene consisting of cvn and sumo (small ubiquitin-related modifier) and a hexahistidine tag was constructed according to the codon bias of the host cell. This small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-fused CVN is expressed in the cytoplasm of E. coli in a folded and soluble form (\u003E30% of the total soluble protein), yielding 3 to 4 mg of native rCVN from 1 g of wet cells to a purity up to 97.6%. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis showed that the purified rCVN was an intact and homogeneous protein with a molecular weight of 11,016.68 Da. Potent antiviral activity of rCVN against herpes simplex virus type 1 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1/IIIB was confirmed in a dose-dependent manner at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, the His-SUMO double-fused CVN provides an efficient approach for the soluble expression of rCVN in the cytoplasm of E. coli, allowing an alternative system to develop bioprocess for the large-scale production of this antiviral candidate.","publish_time":"2009-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gao, Xianglei; Chen, Wei; Guo, Chaowan; Qian, Chuiwen; Liu, Ge; Ge, Feng; Huang, Yadong; Kitazato, Kaio; Wang, Yifei; Xiong, Sheng","journal":"Appl Microbiol Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb1fd89c0097f7b69190f558c4c3a1cd5791b0f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7080120.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-009-2078-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19547966/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["CVN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["native rCVN","soluble expression of rCVN","purified rCVN","Potent antiviral activity of rCVN","SUMO double-fused CVN","soluble form","functional recombinant CVN","total soluble protein","small ubiquitin-related modifier","efficient approach","promising antiviral candidate","cytoplasm of","Escherichia coli","herpes simplex virus type","human immunodeficiency virus type","homogeneous protein","improved approach","reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis","time","flight mass spectrometry","molecular weight","aggregation","IIIB","low sequence homology","g of wet cells","insufficient yield","large-scale production","dose-dependent manner","laser desorption ionization","nanomolar concentrations","bioprocess","obstacle","codon bias","abnormal modification","known proteins","alternative system","hexahistidine tag","host cell","Matrix","purity","fusion gene","Cyanovirin-N"],"language":"en"},

This systematic review aims to categorise, summarise, synthesise, and appraise the research on CRM in the healthcare environment, considering the absence of coherent and comprehensive scholarship of disparate data on CRM. Various databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search of studies that examine CRM in the healthcare environment (including hospitals, clinics, medical centres, and nursing homes). Analysis and evaluation of 19 carefully selected studies revealed three main research categories: (i) social CRM \u2018eCRM\u2019; (ii) implementing CRMS; and (iii) adopting CRMS; with positive outcomes for CRM both in terms of patients relationship/communication with hospital, satisfaction, medical treatment/outcomes and empowerment and hospitals medical operation, productivity, cost, performance, efficiency and service quality. This is the first systematic review to comprehensively synthesise and summarise empirical evidence from disparate CRM research data (quantitative, qualitative, and mixed) in the healthcare environment. Our results revealed that substantial gaps exist in the knowledge of using CRM in the healthcare environment. Future research should focus on exploring: (i) other potential factors, such as patient characteristics, culture (of both the patient and hospital), knowledge management, trust, security, and privacy for implementing and adopting CRMS and (ii) other CRM categories, such as mobile CRM (mCRM) and data mining CRM.","publish_time":"2020-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Baashar, Yahia; Alhussian, Hitham; Patel, Ahmed; Alkawsi, Gamal; Alzahrani, Ahmed Ibrahim; Alfarraj, Osama; Hayder, Gasim","journal":"Computer Standards \u0026 Interfaces","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c72616f6e3dbb2140fa84500fbf5e190a4e040d7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920548919304593; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0920548919304593","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRMS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CRM categories","mobile CRM","social CRM","disparate CRM research data","data mining CRM","healthcare environment","research specific","Future research","CRMS","main research categories","customer satisfaction","hospitals medical operation","medical treatment","medical centres","comprehensive scholarship of disparate data","knowledge management","Abstract Customer relationship management","systematic review","comprehensive search of studies","effective customer relationships","selected studies","positive outcomes","patient characteristics","terms of patients relationship","cost","productivity","empowerment","performance","clinics","absence of coherent","empirical evidence","efficiency","significant progress","trust","mCRM","telecommunications","areas","interactions","stakeholders","security","banking","manufacturing","innovative technology","service quality","nursing homes","Numerous researches","substantial gaps","potential factors","evaluation","privacy","culture","loyalty","profitability","results","Analysis","eCRM","Various databases"],"language":"en"},

For live-attenuated vaccines, this has implications for stability, as replication may result in mutations that either restore the wild-type phenotype via reversion or compensate for the attenuating mutations by increasing virulence (pseudoreversion). Recent studies have demonstrated that altering the mutation rate of an RNA virus is an effective attenuation tool. To validate the safety of low-fidelity mutations to increase vaccine attenuation, several mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) were tested in the live-attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus vaccine strain, TC-83. Next generation sequencing after passage in the presence of mutagens revealed a mutant containing three mutations in the RdRp, TC-83 3x, to have decreased replication fidelity, while a second mutant, TC-83 4x displayed no change in fidelity, but shared many phenotypic characteristics with TC-83 3x. Both mutants exhibited increased, albeit inconsistent attenuation in an infant mouse model, as well as increased immunogenicity and complete protection against lethal challenge of an adult murine model compared with the parent TC-83. During serial passaging in a highly permissive model, the mutants increased in virulence but remained less virulent than the parent TC-83. These results suggest that the incorporation of low-fidelity mutations into the RdRp of live-attenuated vaccines for RNA viruses can confer increased immunogenicity whilst showing some evidence of increased attenuation. However, while in theory such constructs may result in more effective vaccines, the instability of the vaccine phenotype decreases the likelihood of this being an effective vaccine strategy.","publish_time":"2018-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kautz, Tiffany F; Guerbois, Mathilde; Khanipov, Kamil; Patterson, Edward I; Langsjoen, Rose M; Yun, Ruimei; Warmbrod, Kelsey L; Fofanov, Yuriy; Weaver, Scott C; Forrester, Naomi L","journal":"Virus Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e91991355bc76a376b379387983a5ac08f179ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5841381.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29593882/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vey004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fidelity mutations","vaccine attenuation","attenuating mutations","parent TC","RNA virus replication","increased immunogenicity","evidence of increased attenuation","RNA viruses","RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase","RdRp of live","vaccine phenotype","effective vaccines","live-attenuated vaccines","virulence","decreased replication fidelity","effective attenuation tool","effective vaccine strategy","inconsistent attenuation","permissive model","mutants","Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus vaccine strain","adult murine model","infant mouse model","incorporation of low","safety of low","wild-type phenotype","lethal challenge","complete protection","presence of mutagens","passage","implications","instability","likelihood","potential","mutation rate","generation sequencing","serial passaging","constructs","pseudoreversion","phenotypic characteristics","results","change","pathogenesis","Recent studies","theory"],"language":"en"},

To investigate antigenic cross-reactivity at the molecular level, 155 long-term T-cell clones (TCC) were derived from 32 MS patients by in vitro selection with MBP, proteolipid protein (PLP) or HCoV (strains 229E and OC43). Overall, 114 TCC were virus-specific, 31 were specific for myelin Ag and 10 other were HCoV/myelin cross-reactive. Twenty-eight virus-specific TCC and 7 myelin-specific TCC were obtained from six healthy donors. RACE RT-PCR amplification of the V\u03B2 chains of five of ten the cross-reactive TCC confirmed clonality and sequencing identified the CDR3 region associated with cross-reactivity.

For ensuring high prediction rate, a novel Extremal Optimization tuned Neural Network (EO-NN) classification algorithm has been developed using hybridization of the extremal optimization with the feed-forward neural network. Additionally, a location based alert system has also been suggested to provide the global positioning system (GPS)-based location information of each KFD infected user and the risk-prone zones as early as possible to prevent the outbreak. Furthermore, a comparative study of proposed EO-NN with state of art classification algorithms has been carried out and it can be concluded that EO-NN outperforms others with an average accuracy of 91.56%, a sensitivity of 91.53% and a specificity of 97.13% respectively in classification and accurate identification of risk-prone areas.","publish_time":"2018-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Majumdar, Abhishek; Debnath, Tapas; Sood, Sandeep K.; Baishnab, Krishna Lal","journal":"J Med Syst","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9408d795fee2cfae4824d7f635a6abbbe47c7aa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088392.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-018-1041-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30173290/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KFD"],"locations":["South Asia"],"keyphrases":["disease outbreak","KFD infected user","KFD infected patients","Neural Network","comparative study of proposed EO-NN","based location information","Kyasanur Forest Disease","novel Extremal Optimization","risk-prone zones","life-threatening tick-borne viral infectious disease endemic","state of art classification algorithms","prone areas","alert system","accurate identification of risk","early phase of infection","global positioning system","GPS","new fog computing","South Asia","e-Healthcare framework","high prediction rate","hybridization","feed","large extent","paper","regions","average accuracy","year","past decade","sensitivity","epidemic","specificity"],"language":"en"},

Given potential risks of infection during the outbreak of severe infectious diseases, the need for a full understanding of its mechanism and protective measures within the field of epidemiology and engineering becomes pressing. This review paper considers progress achieved in existing studies of the concerned issue regarding different research priorities. Considerable progress in observing and modeling the inter-flat transmission and dispersion under either buoyancy- or wind-dominated conditions has been made, while fully understanding the combined buoyancy and wind effects is not yet possible. Many methods, including on-site measurements, wind tunnel tests and numerical simulations, have contributed to the research development, despite some deficiencies of each method. Although the inter-flat transmission and dispersion characteristics can be demonstrated and quantified in a time-averaged sense to some extent, there are still unanswered questions at a fundamental level about transient dispersion process and thermal boundary conditions, calling for further studies with more advanced models for simulations and more sound experiments for validations.","publish_time":"2015-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mao, Jiachen; Gao, Naiping","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/537aa0a30e33e4a84bf6c6226e4f377b826c1b65.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118930.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132315301359; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132315301359; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2015.09.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288036/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs0NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inter-flat transmission","inter-flat airborne cross-transmission","dispersion characteristics","wind effects","wind-dominated conditions","understanding","transient dispersion process","wind tunnel tests","existing studies","numerical simulations","combined buoyancy","research development","Considerable progress","thermal boundary conditions","different research priorities","fundamental level","concerned issue","field of epidemiology","on-site measurements","people","extent","outbreak of severe infectious diseases","protective measures","unanswered questions","sound experiments","single-sided natural ventilation","advanced models","need","mechanism","potential risks of infection","review paper","high-rise residential buildings","understood transport routes","time-averaged sense","engineering","deficiencies","validations","methods","populated areas"],"language":"en"},

The identification of proteins associated with PEDV infection might provide insight into PEDV pathogenesis and facilitate the development of novel antiviral strategies. We analyzed the differential protein profile of PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells using mass spectrometry and an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification. A total of 126 proteins were identified that were differentially expressed between the PEDV-infected and mock-infected groups (P \u003C0.05, quantitative ratio \u22651.2), among which the expression of 58 proteins was up-regulated and that of 68 proteins was down-regulated in the PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells, involving in integrin \u03B22/\u03B23, cystatin-C. The Gene Ontology analysis indicated that the molecular function of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) was primarily related to binding and catalytic activity, and that the biological functions in which the DEPs are involved included metabolism, organismal systems, cellular processes, genetic information processing, environmental information processing, and diseases. Among the disease-related functions, certain anti-viral pathways and proteins, such as the RIG-I-like receptor, Rap1, autophagy, mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K-Akt and Jak-STAT signaling pathways, and integrin \u03B22/\u03B23 and cystatin-C proteins, represented potential factors in PEDV infection.

Using a phage display technology in a chicken system, high-affinity monoclonal antibody fragments against the SARS-CoV spike protein were characterized. Ten truncated spike protein gene fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Following the immunization of chickens with these recombinant spike proteins, two single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody libraries were established with short or long linkers to contain 5\u00D7107 and 9\u00D7106 transformants, respectively. After four rounds of panning selection, the scFv antibodies of randomly chosen clones were demonstrated by Coomassie blue staining, and verified by western blot analysis. In a comparison of nucleotide sequences with the chicken germline gene, we found that all clones varied in the complementarity-determining regions, that two scFv antibodies reacted significantly with SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells, and that those two specific scFv antibodies recognized the same region of the spike protein spanning amino acid residues 750\u20131000.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients with COVID-19 pneumonia including ordinary cases (group A, n=12), severe cases(group B, n=15) and critical cases (group C, n=24) were retrospectively enrolled. The qualitative and quantitative indicators from chest CT were recorded and compared using Fisher\u0027s exact test, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis H test and receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Depending on the severity of the disease, the number of involved lung segments and lobes, the frequencies of consolidation, crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram increased in more severe cases. Qualitative indicators including total severity score for the whole lung and total score for crazy-paving and consolidation could distinguish groups B and C from A(69% sensitivity, 83% specificity and 73% accuracy) but were similar between group B and group C. Combined qualitative and quantitative indicators could distinguish these three groups with high sensitivity(B\u002BC vs. A, 90%; C vs. B, 92%), specificity(100%, 87%) and accuracy(92%, 90%). Critical cases had higher total severity score(\u003E10) and higher total score for crazy-paving and consolidation(\u003E4) than ordinary cases, and had higher mean lung density(\u003E-779HU) and full width at half maximum(\u003E128HU) but lower relative volume of normal lung density(\u226650%) than ordinary/severe cases. In our critical cases, eight patients with relative volume of normal lung density smaller than 40% received mechanical ventilation for supportive treatment, and two of them had died. CONCLUSION: A rapid, accurate severity assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia based on chest CT would be feasible and could provide help for making management decisions, especially for the critical cases.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lyu, Peijie; Liu, Xing; Zhang, Rui; Shi, Lei; Gao, Jianbo","journal":"Invest Radiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9684de2d9f394c567ef850f4af0996cca6c148e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304402/; https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000689","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs1MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher"],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ordinary cases","severe cases","CT characteristics of critical cases","group B","group C","higher total severity score","Qualitative indicators","higher total score","quantitative chest CT indicators","quantitative indicators","groups B","higher mean lung density","pneumonia","clinical severity of COVID","relative volume of normal lung density smaller","lower relative volume of normal lung density","accurate severity assessment of COVID","crazy-paving pattern","number of involved lung segments","patients","frequencies of consolidation","HU","accuracy","specificity","high sensitivity","Fisher\u0027s exact test","Kruskal-Wallis H test","one-way ANOVA","receiver","lobes","air bronchogram","mechanical ventilation","characteristic analysis","disease","management decisions","supportive treatment","help","CONCLUSION","METHODS","width","maximum","MATERIALS","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we predicted 4 T cell epitopes from ESAT-6, Ag85A/B and CFP-10 antigens and constructed an ECANS (epitopes casted in a natural structure) DNA vaccine by inserting the epitope DNA segments separately into the gene backbone of M. tb-derived HSP65 (heat shock protein 65) carrier. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of pECANS DNA vaccine were assessed in BALB/c mice after intramuscular immunization with 4 doses of 50\u03BCg ECANS DNA and followed by mycobaterial challenge 4 weeks after the last immunization. Compared to plasmid encoding HSP65, pECANS DNA immunization elicited remarkably higher levels of IFN-\u03B3 production by both CD4\u002B and CD8\u002B T cells, which were coupled with higher frequencies of antigen-specific T cells and higher CTL activity. Significantly enhanced levels of Th1 cytokines (IFN-\u03B3 and IL-12) and increased serum IgG2a/IgG1 ratio were also noted, indicating a predominant Th1 immune response achieved by pECANS DNA immunization. In the consequence, a better protection against Mycobacterium bovis BCG challenge was achieved which was evidenced by reduced bacterial loads in lungs and spleens and profound attenuation of lung inflammation and injury. Our results suggested that multi-T cell-epitope based ECANS gene vaccine induced T cell response to multiple T cell epitopes and led to enhanced protection against mycobacterial challenge.

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. METHODS: We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R(t)) for COVID-19 and influenza A H1N1 to estimate changes in transmissibility over time. Attitudes towards COVID-19 and changes in population behaviours were reviewed through three telephone surveys done on Jan 20\u201323, Feb 11\u201314, and March 10\u201313, 2020. FINDINGS: COVID-19 transmissibility measured by R(t) has remained at approximately 1 for 8 weeks in Hong Kong. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34\u201353%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated R(t) of 1\u00B728 (95% CI 1\u00B726\u20131\u00B730) before the start of the school closures to 0\u00B772 (0\u00B770\u20130\u00B774) during the closure weeks. Similarly, a 33% (24\u201343%) reduction in transmissibility was seen based on paediatric hospitalisation rates, from an R(t) of 1\u00B710 (1\u00B706\u20131\u00B712) before the start of the school closures to 0\u00B773 (0\u00B768\u20130\u00B777) after school closures. Among respondents to the surveys, 74\u00B75%, 97\u00B75%, and 98\u00B78% reported wearing masks when going out, and 61\u00B73%, 90\u00B72%, and 85\u00B71% reported avoiding crowded places in surveys 1 (n=1008), 2 (n=1000), and 3 (n=1005), respectively. INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

Our previous understanding of the phenotypes and functions of microglia has been greatly extended by a dearth of recent investigations. Distinct genetically defined subsets of microglia are now recognized to perform their own independent functions in specific conditions. The molecular profiling of single microglial cells indicates extensively heterogeneous reactions in different neurological disorders, resulting in multiple potentials for crosstalk with other kinds of CNS cells such as astrocytes and neurons. In settings of neurological diseases it could thus be prudent to establish effective cell\u2010based therapies by targeting entire microglial networks. Notably, activated microglial depletion through genetic targeting or pharmacological therapies within a suitable time window can stimulate replenishment of the CNS niche with new microglia. Additionally, enforced repopulation through provision of replacement cells also represents a potential means of exchanging dysfunctional with functional microglia. In each setting the newly repopulated microglia might have the potential to resolve ongoing neuroinflammation. In this review, we aim to summarize the most recent knowledge of microglia and to highlight microglial depletion and subsequent repopulation as a promising cell replacement therapy. Although glial cell replacement therapy is still in its infancy and future translational studies are still required, the approach is scientifically sound and provides new optimism for managing the neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation induced by activated microglia.","publish_time":"2018-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Jinming; Zhu, Keying; Zhang, Xing\u2010Mei; Harris, Robert A.","journal":"Glia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fbf3cc84b1d412693330fffee86bef8fbdda3b07.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6635749.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/glia.23529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30378163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new microglia","functions of microglia","functional microglia","repopulated microglia","recent knowledge of microglia","defined subsets of microglia","microglial depletion","kinds of CNS cells","provision of replacement cells","neurological development","settings of neurological diseases","promising cell replacement therapy","glial cell replacement therapy","molecular profiling of single microglial cells","prominent immune cells","different neurological disorders","CNS niche","entire microglial networks","effective cell","pharmacological therapies","based therapies","subsequent repopulation","potential means","new optimism","genetic targeting","independent functions","ongoing neuroinflammation","dearth of recent investigations","heterogeneous reactions","replenishment","central nervous system","suitable time window","multiple potentials","infancy","critical players","crosstalk","homeostasis","phenotypes","astrocytes","neurotoxicity","future translational studies","specific conditions","approach","previous understanding","neurons","review"],"language":"en"},

Here, we used X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptor allows to define residues important for binding. From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S up to seven can be replaced and ACE2 can still function as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S-binding or infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or the acquisition of N-glycosylation sites located near the S-interface. Of note, Pigs and dogs, which are not or not effectively infected and have only a few changes in the binding site, exhibit relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with viruses from Bat-CoV-RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas the Bat-CoV-RaTG13 exhibits five. However, ACE2 of pangolin exhibit seven changes relative to human ACE2, a similar number of substitutions is present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon, and civet suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not especially adapted to ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts. These analyses provide new insight into the receptor usage and animal source/origin of SARS-CoV-2.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is threatening people worldwide and there are no drugs or vaccines available to mitigate its spread. The origin of the virus is still unclear and whether pets and livestock can be infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes indicating that the species barrier might be low. An exception are dogs and especially pigs, which, however, revealed relatively low ACE2 expression levels in the respiratory tract. Monitoring of animals is necessary to prevent the generation of a new coronavirus reservoir. Finally, our analysis also showed that SARS-CoV-2 may not be specifically adapted to any of its putative intermediate hosts.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhai, Xiaofeng; Sun, Jiumeng; Yan, Ziqing; Zhang, Jie; Zhao, Jin; Zhao, Zongzheng; Gao, Qi; He, Wan-Ting; Veit, Michael; Su, Shuo","journal":"Journal of virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404529/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00831-20","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV","Pangolin-CoV","Bat-CoV","ACE2 of bats","host receptor ACE2","origin of SARS","low levels of ACE2","ACE2 of pangolin exhibit","S-binding","putative intermediate hosts of SARS","low ACE2 expression levels","interaction sites of ACE2 proteins","binding site","X-ray structures of human ACE2","prediction of potential hosts of SARS","receptor-binding domain","Effective binding","RBD of S","receptor usage","S-interface","amino acid changes","changes relative","farm animals","different animals","pets","Monitoring of animals","infection of cells","respiratory tract","residues important","variable amino acids","RaTG13","Pigs","dogs","analysis","new coronavirus reservoir","animal source","invariable residues","new insight","glycosylation sites","respective animal","species barrier","novel coronavirus","host range","similar number of substitutions","generation","raccoon","prerequisite","viruses","certain positions","spike protein","acquisition of N","framework","periphery","loss","livestock","civet","unknown scientific questions","vaccines available","drugs","analyses","emergence","threatening people","spread","note","exception","Comparison","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

As the veterinary medicine industry has steadily grown, it is crucial to set up a baseline for the quality of medicine as well as the insufficiency or excessiveness of the active ingredients in drug products to ensure the compliance, safety and efficacy of these medicines. Thus, the 10 years data of post-marketing quality control study was summarized to determine the rate and extent of non-compliance of these medicines and to establish baseline data for future quality control measures of veterinary medicine. RESULTS: In this study, 1650 drugs for veterinary use were collected per year from each city and province in Korea and analysed for the quantity of active ingredients according to the \u201Cnational post-market surveillance (NPMS) system\u201D over the past decade. The NPMS assessment was performed using liquid and gas chromatography, titration, UV/Vis spectrophotometry, and bioassays. A total of 358 cases were deemed noncompliant, with the average noncompliance rate for all medicine types being 2.0%. The average noncompliance rates for antibiotics, biologics and other chemical drugs except antibiotics (OCD) were 1.1%, 1.2%, and 3.0%, respectively. The first leading cause for noncompliant products was insufficient quantity of major ingredients (283 cases), and the second leading cause was the existence of excess amount of active ingredients (60 cases). Tylosin, spiramycin, ampicillin, tetracyclines and penicillins were most frequently found to be noncompliant among antibiotics. Among the OCD, the noncompliance was found commonly in vitamin A. CONCLUSION: The overall trend presented gradually decreasing violation rates, suggesting that the quality of veterinary medicines has improved. Consistent application of the NPMS assessment and the establishment of the Korea Veterinary Good Manufacturing Practice (KVGMP) will help to maintain the good quality of medicine.","publish_time":"2017-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kang, JeongWoo; Park, Hae-chul; Jang, Yang ho; Hossain, Md Akil; Jeong, Kyunghun; Jeong, Mi young; Yun, Seon-Jong; Park, Sung-won; Kim, Dae gyun; Lee, Kwang-jick","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d37dca746114af4879ecb53c1584fb776d748be.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5441046.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1054-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28532461/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs2ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NPMS"],"locations":["Korea"],"keyphrases":["quality of veterinary medicines","good quality of medicine","veterinary medicine industry","veterinary use","future quality control measures of veterinary medicine","quantity of active ingredients","antibiotics","medicine types","cases","noncompliant products","NPMS assessment","Korea Veterinary Good Manufacturing Practice","average noncompliance rates","years data of post-marketing quality control study","baseline data","insufficient quantity of major ingredients","leading cause","efficacy","OCD","drug products","chemical drugs","decreasing violation rates","national post-market surveillance","biologics","UV","titration","overall trend","system","establishment","gas chromatography","liquid","KVGMP","existence of excess","Vis spectrophotometry","spiramycin","ampicillin","tetracyclines","treatment of diseases","growth promotion","vitamin","excessiveness","safety","insufficiency","Tylosin","penicillins","prevention","bioassays","CONCLUSION","city","province","Consistent application","extent of non-compliance","past decade","total","BACKGROUND","livestock","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Current MS therapies have limited ability to prevent neuronal damage, suggesting additional neuroprotective therapies are needed. Compounds that activate the NAD(\u002B)-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase prevent neuronal loss in an autoimmune-mediated MS model, but the mechanism of this effect is unknown, and it is unclear whether SIRT1 activating compounds exert similar effects in demyelinating disease induced by other etiologies. We measured neuronal loss in C57BL/6 mice inoculated with a neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus, MHV-A59, that induces an MS-like disease. RESULTS: Oral treatment with the SIRT1 activating compound SRTAW04 significantly increased SIRT1 activity within optic nerves and prevented neuronal loss during optic neuritis, an inflammatory demyelinating optic nerve lesion that occurs in MS and its animal models. MHV-A59 induced neuronal loss was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and SRTAW04 treatment significantly reduced ROS levels while promoting increased expression of enzymes involved in mitochondrial function and reduction of ROS. SRTAW04 exerted similar protective effects in EAE spinal cords, with decreased demyelination. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate that SIRT1 activating compounds prevent neuronal loss in viral-induced demyelinating disease similar to their effects in autoimmune-mediated disease. One mechanism of this neuroprotective effect involves increasing mitochondrial biogenesis with reduction of oxidative stress. SIRT1 activators represent a potential neuroprotective therapy for MS. Understanding common mechanisms of these effects in distinct disease models will help identify targets for more specific therapies.","publish_time":"2014-01-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Reas S; Dine, Kimberly; Das Sarma, Jayasri; Shindler, Kenneth S","journal":"Acta Neuropathol Commun","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab906d73fa3fecf440ed8c98ad852397bf7bee1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3892130.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24383546/; https://doi.org/10.1186/2051-5960-2-3","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAD","ROS","EAE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neuronal loss","demyelinating disease similar","similar effects","SIRT1 activators","significant neuronal damage","increased SIRT1 activity","autoimmune-mediated disease","Compounds","Current MS therapies","similar protective effects","dependent SIRT1 deacetylase","distinct disease models","SRTAW04 treatment","reduction of ROS","neuroprotective effect","autoimmune-mediated MS model","additional neuroprotective therapies","optic neuritis","optic nerves","compound SRTAW04","MHV-A59","specific therapies","RESULTS","inflammatory demyelinating optic nerve lesion","reduced ROS levels","potential neuroprotective therapy","mitochondrial biogenesis","mitochondrial function","Oral treatment","decreased demyelination","animal models","increased expression of enzymes","reduction of oxidative stress","EAE spinal cords","accumulation","Understanding common mechanisms","neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus","reactive oxygen species","evidence","mice","targets","ability","central nervous system inflammation","BACKGROUND","Multiple sclerosis","NAD","C57BL","permanent functional impairment","CONCLUSIONS","etiologies"],"language":"en"},

Although vaccines and drugs are the best solution to prevent this threat, a more effective treatment for H5 strains of influenza has yet to be developed. Therefore, the development of therapeutics/drugs that combat H5N1 influenza virus infection is becoming increasingly important. Lycorine, the major component of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, exhibits better protective effects against A/CK/GD/178/04 (H5N1) (GD178) viruses than the commercial neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor oseltamivir in our prior study. Lycorine demonstrates outstanding antiviral activity because of its inhibitory activity against the export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) from the nucleus. However, how lycorine affects the proteome of AIV infected cells is unknown. Therefore, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis to identify changes in protein expression in AIV-infected Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells treated with lycorine. Three groups were designed: mock infection group (M), virus infection group (V), and virus infection and lycorine-treated after virus infection group (L). The multiplexed tandem mass tag (TMT) approach was employed to analyze protein level in this study. In total, 5,786 proteins were identified from the three groups of cells by using TMT proteomic analysis. In the V/M group, 1,101 proteins were identified, of which 340 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were determined during HPAIV infection; among the 1,059 proteins identified from the lycorine-treated group, 258 proteins presented significant change. Here, 71 proteins showed significant upregulation or downregulation of expression in the virus-infected/mock and virus-infected/lycorine-treated comparisons, and the proteins in each fraction were functionally classified further. Interestingly, lycorine treatment decreased the levels of the nuclear pore complex protein 93 (Nup93, E2RSV7), which is associated with nuclear\u2013cytoplasmic transport. In addition, Western blot experiments confirmed that the expression of Nup93 was significantly downregulated in lycorine treatment but induced after viral infection. Our results may provide new insights into how lycorine may trap vRNPs in the nucleus and suggest new potential therapeutic targets for influenza virus.","publish_time":"2019-10-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Li; Zhang, Jia Hao; Zhang, Xiao Li; Lao, Guang Jie; Su, Guan Ming; Wang, Lei; Li, Yao Lan; Ye, Wen Cai; He, Jun","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/76b96ffbbdea59714eba9d891362ceb32731ad90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6778435.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.7697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592345/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lycorine"],"organizations":["AIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proteins","lycorine treatment","virus infection group","lycorine-treated group","virus-infected","H5N1 influenza virus infection","lycorine-treated comparisons","mock infection group","HPAIV infection","viral infection","protein expression","proteome of AIV infected cells","pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses","expression of Nup93","groups of cells","downregulation of expression","H5 strains of influenza","protein level","vRNPs","drugs","effective treatment","TMT proteomic analysis","nucleus","AIV-infected Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells","nuclear pore complex protein","comparative proteomic analysis","inhibitory activity","new insights","significant upregulation","significant change","prior study","outstanding antiviral activity","new potential therapeutic targets","export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes","cause rapid systemic illness","disease","death","inhibitor oseltamivir","commercial neuraminidase","approach","changes","levels","susceptible animals","multiplexed tandem mass tag","major component of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids","protective effects","Western blot experiments","high morbidity","mortality rates","best solution","threat","GD178","addition","vaccines","E2RSV7","development of therapeutics","DEPs","cytoplasmic transport","results","total","fraction"],"language":"en"},

The major route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is in contention, with the airborne route a likely transmission pathway for carrying the virus within indoor environments. Until now, there has been no evidence for detection of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this may have implication for the potential spread of the COVID-19. We investigated the air of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 in the largest hospital in Iran, on March 17, 2020. To collect the SARS-CoV-2 particles, ten air samples were collected into the sterile standard midget impingers containing 20 mL DMEM with 100 \u03BCg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin and 1% antifoam reagent for 1 h. Besides, indoor particle number concentrations, CO2, relative humidity and temperature were recorded throughout the sampling duration.

The novel virus belongs to the coronaviruses family, which is responsible for causing mild to moderate colds. The control and command center of Saudi Ministry of Health issues a daily report on MERS-CoV infection cases. The infection with MERS-CoV can lead to fatal complications, however little information is known about this novel virus. In this paper, we apply two data mining techniques in order to better understand the stability and the possibility of recovery from MERS-CoV infections. METHOD: The Naive Bayes classifier and J48 decision tree algorithm were used to build our models. The dataset used consists of 1082 records of cases reported between 2013 and 2015. In order to build our prediction models, we split the dataset into two groups. The first group combined recovery and death records. A new attribute was created to indicate the record type, such that the dataset can be used to predict the recovery from MERS-CoV. The second group contained the new case records to be used to predict the stability of the infection based on the current status attribute. RESULTS: The resulting recovery models indicate that healthcare workers are more likely to survive. This could be due to the vaccinations that healthcare workers are required to get on regular basis. As for the stability models using J48, two attributes were found to be important for predicting stability: symptomatic and age. Old patients are at high risk of developing MERS-CoV complications. Finally, the performance of all the models was evaluated using three measures: accuracy, precision, and recall. In general, the accuracy of the models is between 53.6% and 71.58%. CONCLUSION: We believe that the performance of the prediction models can be enhanced with the use of more patient data. As future work, we plan to directly contact hospitals in Riyadh in order to collect more information related to patients with MERS-CoV infections.","publish_time":"2016-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Turaiki, Isra; Alshahrani, Mona; Almutairi, Tahani","journal":"J Infect Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bccaa2b03f14a732b211a165263ae4fce93f0337.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102847.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27641481/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034116301460; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034116301460; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2016.09.007","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzY5LmNzdjs4ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1722275,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:08Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"B3Wp8DxjhmH7zOb/Ue/JAg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_69.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Saudi Ministry of Health"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia","Riyadh"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV infections","stability models","MERS-CoV infection cases","prediction models","outbreak of MERS","resulting recovery models","high risk of developing MERS-CoV complications","order","dataset","possibility of recovery","records of cases","group combined recovery","healthcare workers","death records","novel virus","new case records","accuracy","new attribute","performance","Saudi Arabia","little information","fatal complications","Old patients","patient data","data mining techniques","current status attribute","J48 decision tree algorithm","command center of Saudi Ministry of Health issues","daily report","Naive Bayes classifier","worldwide attention","control","coronaviruses family","attributes","moderate colds","METHOD","precision","Riyadh","measures","RESULTS","record type","recall","paper","hospitals","age","vaccinations","regular basis","future work","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","groups"],"language":"en"},

Self-assembling techniques were employed to create asymmetric plasmonic chiral nanostructures for extending the spectral range of circular dichroism (CD) response for obtaining superior plasmonic resonant coupling with the QDs excitonic state; this may help to achieve lower the limit of detection (LOD) values. As a result, the designed probe exhibited avian influenza A (H5N1) viral concentration at picomolar level, a significant improvement in sensitivity in comparison to a non-assembled CAu NPs based chiroassay. The practicability of the proposed sensing system was successfully demonstrated on several virus cultures including, avian influenza A (H4N6) virus, fowl adenovirus and coronavirus in blood samples.

These findings indicate that direct antigen test and shell vial culture would be reliable and timely methods for the diagnosis of hMPV infection in clinical laboratories.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jun, Kyung Ran; Woo, Young Dae; Sung, Heungsup; Kim, Mi-Na","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd4920c28b86f2ea24fdbc92c542993e33b63042.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112862.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093408002024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18602421/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093408002024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.06.008","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shell vial culture of hMPV","direct antigen test","diagnosis of hMPV infection","nasopharyngeal aspirates","RT-PCR","acute respiratory tract infections positive","lower respiratory tract infections","commercial anti-hMPV monoclonal antibody","young children","clinical laboratories","pilot study","simple diagnostic methods","timely methods","specimens positive","larger group prospective study","initial diagnosis","routine diagnostic tests","reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","important etiologic agent of upper","positivity","Abstract Human metapneumovirus","findings","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Unlike other immunologically active polysaccharides, inulin has no immune activity in its native soluble form, but when crystallized into the stable delta inulin isoform, it acquires potent immune actions. Most notably, delta inulin enhances both humoral and cellular immune responses against vaccine antigens, translating into enhanced protection against a broad range of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and toxin-mediated diseases. Delta inulin is distinct compared with typical vaccine adjuvants as it does not require adsorption to antigen and does not appear to work through induction of inflammatory danger signals. Delta inulin manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (referred to as Advax) has been proved to be safe and effective in human trials of influenza vaccines, hepatitis B vaccines, and insect sting allergy vaccines. Advax thereby represents a novel nonreactogenic immune modulator with potential utility across a broad range of human prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petroski, N.","journal":"Immunopotentiators in Modern Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/87c19723aad115f46c01690bfdf5722dd7a6a575.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150192.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128040195000104; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128040195000104","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stable delta inulin isoform","immune activity","therapeutic vaccines","potent immune actions","hepatitis B vaccines","human trials of influenza vaccines","cellular immune responses","potent adjuvants","Advax","broad range of human prophylactic","novel nonreactogenic immune modulator","insect sting allergy vaccines","broad range of viral","typical vaccine adjuvants","vaccine antigens","potential utility","enhanced protection","current Good Manufacturing Practices","reactogenicity","native soluble form","safety issues","toxin-mediated diseases","active polysaccharides","induction of inflammatory danger signals","adsorption"],"language":"en"},

To date, there is no effective antiviral drug available for treating FCV infection. Here, we show that lithium chloride (LiCl) effectively suppresses the replication of FCV strain F9 in Crandell-Reese feline kidney (CRFK) cells. The antiviral activity of LiCl occurred primarily during the early stage of infection and in a dose-dependent manner. LiCl treatment also inhibited the cytopathic effect. LiCl treatment exhibited a strong inhibitory effect against a panel of other two reference strains and two recent FCV isolates from China. These results demonstrate that LiCl might be an effective anti-FCV drug for controlling FCV disease. Further studies are required to explore the antiviral activity of LiCl against FCV replication in vivo.","publish_time":"2015-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Hongxia; Zhang, Xiaozhan; Liu, Chunguo; Liu, Dafei; Liu, Jiasen; Tian, Jin; Qu, Liandong","journal":"Arch Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/067e27c79ebe5ee15b998e8706ffb9ce4f1deb20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7086906.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2534-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239340/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcwLmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1704970,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BPgTFdVjd\u002BzYK08hmoE1LQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_70.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FCV"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["FCV disease","FCV replication","FCV infection","prevalence of FCV","LiCl treatment","antiviral activity of LiCl","recent FCV isolates","effective anti-FCV drug","replication of FCV strain F9","effective antiviral drug available","Feline calicivirus","cytopathic effect","strong inhibitory effect","early stage of infection","Crandell-Reese feline kidney","upper respiratory tract disease","high gene mutation rate","panel","CRFK","reference strains","contagious pathogen","cats","cells","emergence of variants","infections","dose-dependent manner","widespread vaccination","China","lithium chloride","date","studies","results"],"language":"en"},

However, it is not pathogenic for bat at all, because free DNA in cytoplasm or blood cannot bring up violent immune response in bat; but it can produce severe inflammations in human. I hypothesized that the damage induced by free DNA is a reason for severe COVID-19, which can explain many symptoms of this disease, such as cytokine storm, ARDS and muscus plug, acute injuries of heart, liver and kidney, and some special symptoms of COVID-19.

In unstimulated cells, all single caveolae at the cell surface and the majority of those localized deeper into the cytoplasm were freely accessible from the medium, as judged from electron microscopy of synoviocytes exposed to the membrane impermeable marker Ruthenium Red. Caveolar internalization could be induced by a CD13 antibody or by cholera toxin B subunit (CTB). Thus, in experiments using sequential labeling with Alexa 488- and 594-conjugated CTB, about 50% of CTB-positive caveolae were internalized by 5 min of chase, and these remained inaccessible from the cell surface for periods up to 24 h. No colocalization with an endosomal marker, EEA1, or Lysotracker was observed, indicating that internalized caveolae clusters represent a static compartment. Vimentin was identified as the most abundant protein in detergent resistant membranes (DRM\u2019s), and by immunogold electron microscopy caveolae were seen in intimate contact with intermediate-size filaments. These observations indicate that vimentin-based filaments are responsible for the spatio-temporal fixation of caveolae clusters. RECK, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein acting as a negative regulator of cell surface metalloproteinases, was also localized to the caveolae clusters. We propose that these clusters function as static reservoirs of specialized lipid raft domains where proteins involved in cell\u2013cell interactions, such as CD13, can be sequestered by binding to RECK in a regulatory manner.","publish_time":"2008-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berg, Kasper D.; Tamas, Raluca M.; Riemann, Anne; Niels-Christiansen, Lise-Lotte; Hansen, Gert H.; Michael Danielsen, E.","journal":"Histochem Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/25dcedd6db0a008906e4c170f0bd14c8d2e18d19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087690.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00418-008-0475-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18648844/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lysotracker"],"organizations":["Ruthenium Red","RECK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["internalized caveolae clusters","single caveolae","numerous caveolae","CTB-positive caveolae","cell interactions","CD13-positive cell-type","immunogold electron microscopy caveolae","spatio-temporal fixation of caveolae clusters","clusters function","interconnected clusters","negative regulator of cell surface metalloproteinases","CD13 antibody","RECK","conjugated CTB","electron microscopy of synoviocytes","vimentin-based filaments","abundant protein","static compartment","endosomal marker","glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein","intermediate-size filaments","membrane impermeable marker Ruthenium","static reservoirs of specialized lipid raft domains","proteins","intimate contact","DRM\u2019s","cholera toxin B subunit","Caveolar internalization","detergent resistant membranes","Alexa","cytoplasm","EEA1","colocalization","Lysotracker","binding","periods","majority","experiments","regulatory manner","observations","unstimulated cells","chase","fibroblast"],"language":"en"},

Through a PubMed online search of the literature from 2006 to September 2011, this paper aims to review the published literature on rhinitis in young children below the age of 6 years. It is apparent from epidemiology studies that rhinitis in this age group is a relatively common problem. The condition has a heterogenous etiology with classification into allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Respiratory viral infections may play a role in the pathogenesis of long standing rhinitis, but definitive studies are still lacking. Treatment guidelines for management are lacking for this age group, and is a significant unmet need. Although the consensus is that co-morbidities including otitis media with effusion, adenoidal hypertrophy and asthma, are important considerations of management of these children. Pharmacotherapy is limited for young children especially for those below the age of 2 years. This review underscores the lack of understanding of rhinitis in early childhood and therefore the need for further research in this area.","publish_time":"2011-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hardjojo, Antony; Shek, Lynette PC; van Bever, Hugo PS; Lee, Bee Wah","journal":"Asia Pac Allergy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5d98d889c1739957886a3c27dc6552e695fee2f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3206246.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22053307/; https://doi.org/10.5415/apallergy.2011.1.3.115","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-allergic rhinitis","age group","young children","pathogenesis of long standing rhinitis","years","review","significant unmet need","life threatening condition","published literature","definitive studies","epidemiology studies","quality of life","significant burden","important considerations of management","effusion","classification","otitis media","adenoidal hypertrophy","role","asthma","co-morbidities","heterogenous etiology","lack of understanding","early childhood","caretakers","upper airway","blocked nose","economic cost","Respiratory viral infections","consensus","PubMed online search","sufferers","disease","common problem","sneezing","society","research","area","Treatment guidelines","paper","Pharmacotherapy"],"language":"en"},

Cyclophilins, a family of host peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), play a pivotal role in the life cycles of many viruses and therefore represent an attractive target for broad-spectrum antiviral development. We report here the pangenotypic anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) activity of a small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitor (SMCypI). Mechanistic and modeling studies revealed that the SMCypI bound to cyclophilin A in competition with cyclosporine (CsA), inhibited its PPIase activity, and disrupted the CypA-nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) interaction. Resistance selection showed that the lead SMCypI hardly selected amino acid substitutions conferring low-level or no resistance in vitro. Interestingly, the SMCypI selected D320E and Y321H substitutions, located in domain II of the NS5A protein. These substitutions were previously associated with low-level resistance to cyclophilin inhibitors such as alisporivir. Finally, the SMCypI inhibited the replication of other members of the Flaviviridae family with higher 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) than for HCV. Thus, because of its chemical plasticity and simplicity of synthesis, our new family of SMCypIs represents a promising new class of drugs with the potential for broad-spectrum anti-Flaviviridae activity as well as an invaluable tool to explore the role of cyclophilins in viral life cycles.","publish_time":"2018-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nevers, Quentin; Ruiz, Isaac; Ahnou, Nazim; Donati, Flora; Brillet, Rozenn; Softic, Laurent; Chazal, Maxime; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Fourati, Slim; Baudesson, Camille; Bruscella, Patrice; Gelin, Muriel; Guichou, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel; Ahmed-Belkacem, Abdelhakim","journal":"Antimicrob Agents Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8ee7ec977aa10ef8bbe5633d5dc6bb9793572508.json; document_parses/pdf_json/1c60d93cd686bb14fac65510ad3de47cf8b9332c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6021681.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00126-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29760125/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Flaviviridae family","lead SMCypI","SMCypI selected D320E","broad-spectrum anti-Flaviviridae activity","low-level resistance","new family of SMCypIs","PPIase activity","Y321H substitutions","broad-spectrum antiviral development","role of cyclophilins","HCV","cyclophilin inhibitors","members","Resistance selection","NS5A protein","selected amino acid substitutions","development of specific antiviral drugs","viral life cycles","promising new class of drugs","pivotal role","small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitor","pangenotypic anti-hepatitis C virus","CypA-nonstructural protein","family of host peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases","potential","PPIases","mortality rates","simplicity of synthesis","high incidence","morbidity","effective concentrations","attractive target","CsA","viruses","domain","competition","invaluable tool","chemical plasticity","cyclosporine","modeling studies","alisporivir","replication","interaction"],"language":"en"},

Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available. Methods We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. Results We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17-37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0-8.2%). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81%). Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95%CI 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time \u003E 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time \u003E 5 s (aHR 4.1, 95%CI 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications. Conclusion The 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high. Our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, and are strongly suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high-prophylactic doses, even in the absence of randomized evidence.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klok, F.

A plethora of pathogens can cause these diseases, with the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88 (ETEC) being two of the most salient. In the December 2017 issue of Proteomics Clinical Aplications, Xia and colleagues used comparative proteomics to shed light on how these microbes interact to cause severe disease 1. The authors discovered that TGEV induces an epithelial\u2010mesenchymal transition\u2010like phenotype that augments cell adhesion proteins mediating the attachment of ETEC to intestinal epithelial cells. Moreover, coinfection was found to modulate several host proteins that could bolster pathogen persistence. Importantly, the authors observed that ETEC suppresses the production of inflammatory cytokines induced by TGEV, which may in turn promote the long\u2010term survival of both microbes.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arango Duque, Guillermo; Acevedo Ospina, Hamlet Adolfo","journal":"Proteomics Clin Appl","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167695.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/prca.201700143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29281177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Xia"],"organizations":["Proteomics Clinical Aplications","TGEV","ETEC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TGEV","attachment of ETEC","microbes","authors","comparative proteomics","host proteins","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","cell adhesion proteins","intestinal epithelial cells","issue of Proteomics Clinical Aplications","Xia","colleagues","major causes of piglet mortality","phenotype","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88","diseases","devastating economic losses","mesenchymal transition","production of inflammatory cytokines","Porcine diarrhea","light","industry","long\u2010term survival","pathogen persistence","turn","plethora of pathogens","severe disease","coinfection"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of 1451 patients \u226515 y of age with CAP from two hospitals in Cambodia between 2007 and 2010. The proportion of GNB was estimated. Risk factors and clinical characteristics of CAP due to GNB were assessed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: The prevalence of GNB was 8.6% in all CAP patients and 15.8% among those with a valid respiratory sample. GNB infection was independently associated with diabetes, higher leucocyte count and CAP severity. Mortality was higher in patients with CAP due to GNB. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high proportion of GNB in a population hospitalized for CAP in Cambodia. Given the complex antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of certain GNBs and the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant GNB, microbiological laboratory capacity should be strengthened and prospective clinical trials comparing empiric treatment algorithms according to the severity of CAP are needed.","publish_time":"2018-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Inghammar, Malin; Borand, Laurence; Goyet, Sophie; Rammaert, Blandine; Te, Vantha; Lorn Try, Patrich; Guillard, Bertrand; Buchy, Philippe; Vong, Sirenda; Tek Chheng, Eap; Cavailler, Philippe; Mayaud, Charles; Tarantola, Arnaud","journal":"Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0d1470257ee2c01aea71fe48158b3a129c6e440.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6018679.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29579302/; https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/try022","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GNB","CAP"],"locations":["Asia","Southeast Asia","Cambodia"],"keyphrases":["CAP patients","CAP severity","severity of CAP","resistant GNB","GNB infection","higher prevalence of GNB","clinical characteristics of CAP","high proportion of GNB","Cambodia","prospective clinical trials","higher leucocyte count","Southeast Asia","prospective observational study","rapid emergence of multidrug","empiric treatment algorithms","complex antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of certain GNBs","diabetes","microbiological laboratory capacity","community","pneumonia","population","Western settings","Risk factors","y of age","Gram-negative bacilli","data","BACKGROUND","logistic regression models","hospitals","Mortality","valid respiratory sample","Previous studies","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Infected pigs develop a strong and rapid humoral response but these initial antibodies do not confer protection and can even be harmful by mediating an antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. In contrast, development of neutralising antibodies (NAs) is delayed and generation of cell-mediated immune responses, such as PRRSV-specific interferon (IFN)-\u03B3 secreting cells, is initially erratic. In spite of this, induction of strong and rapid NAs and IFN-\u03B3 responses seem to be required for effective vaccination. PRRSV strongly modulates the host\u2019s immune responses. The virus inhibits key cytokines, such as IFN-\u03B1, and may induce regulatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10. Development of NAs seems to be impaired by the existence of a decoy epitope close to the main neutralisation epitope in glycoprotein 5. This ability to modulate the host immune response probably varies among strains or isolates. The genetic diversity of the virus is very high and it has been shown that this diversity can have serious implications for the development of vaccines, since the immunity induced by one strain may be only partial against a different strain, even within the same genotype. With this panorama, the development of newer and universally efficacious PRRSV vaccines is challenging, but the present state of knowledge allows optimism if collaborative efforts are undertaken in the scientific community.","publish_time":"2008-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mateu, E.; Diaz, I.","journal":"The Veterinary Journal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1dbc2cf5296dfb4317275d42c1788a289cd689cb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110845.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1090023307002031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023307002031","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRRS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Development of NAs","development of vaccines","host immune response","IFN-\u03B3 responses","host\u2019s immune responses","rapid NAs","development of newer","PRRS virus","efficacious PRRSV vaccines","development of neutralising antibodies","rapid humoral response","IFN-\u03B1","PRRSV-specific interferon","initial antibodies","induction of strong","regulatory cytokines","key cytokines","different strain","genetic diversity","main neutralisation epitope","decoy epitope close","\u03B3 secreting cells","challenging subjects of research","veterinary viral immunology","collaborative efforts","optimism","respiratory syndrome","present state of knowledge","strains","serious implications","antibody-dependent enhancement of disease","Infected pigs","generation of cell","interleukin","protection","existence","glycoprotein","contrast","ability","immunity","scientific community","spite","isolates","panorama","effective vaccination","genotype"],"language":"en"},

Fusion-inhibiting peptides bind to S proteins, interfere with refolding, and prevent infection. Here we conjugated fusion-inhibiting peptides to various lipids, expecting this to secure peptides onto cell membranes and thereby increase antiviral potencies. Cholesterol or palmitate adducts increased antiviral potencies up to 1000-fold. Antiviral effects were evident after S proteolytic cleavage, implying that lipid conjugates affixed the peptides at sites of protease-triggered fusion activation. Unlike lipid-free peptides, the lipopeptides suppressed CoV S protein-directed virus entry taking place within endosomes. Cell imaging revealed intracellular peptide aggregates, consistent with their endocytosis into compartments where CoV entry takes place. These findings suggest that lipidations localize antiviral peptides to protease-rich sites of CoV fusion, thereby protecting cells from diverse CoVs.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Jung-Eun; Gallagher, Tom","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1dad74f9f8d058791ce59a54c2c4171c161821e0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112077.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28802158/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682217302520; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.07.033; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682217302520","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antiviral peptides","secure peptides","CoV entry","S proteins","lipid-free peptides","virus-cell membrane fusion","fusion activation","CoV S protein","S proteolytic cleavage","protease-rich sites of CoV fusion","virus entry","Antiviral effects","Cell imaging","cell membranes","cell receptors","increased antiviral potencies","sites of protease","infectious entry","place","lipid conjugates","diverse CoVs","endocytosis","lipopeptides","intracellular peptide aggregates","compartments","viral spike","various lipids","Cholesterol","palmitate","cells","lipidations","life-threatening respiratory diseases","refolding","process","endosomes","findings","Abstract Coronaviruses","infection"],"language":"en"},

In Gabon, a Central African country, we established a surveillance network in four major towns in order to analyze cases of ILI among patients who visited health centers between March 2010 and June 2011, and to determine the viral etiology. METHODS: Nasal swabs were sent for analysis to the Centre International de Recherches M\u00E9dicales de Franceville, where they were screened for 17 respiratory viruses in a multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for all pathogens according the following pairs: adenovirus/parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus/human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/parainfluenza virus 2, pandemic influenza virus A/seasonal influenza virus A (H1N1, H3N2)/seasonal influenza virus B, human coronaviruses 229E/OC43, human coronaviruses NL63/HKU1, rhinovirus/human parechovirus, and enterovirus/parainfluenza virus 3. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 1041 specimens, of which 639 (61%) were positive for at least one virus. Three-quarters of the patients were children under five years old. We therefore focused on this age group, in which 68.1% of patients were positive for at least one virus. The most common viruses were adenoviruses (17.5%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1\u20134 (16.8%), enteroviruses (EV) (14.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (13.5%), and influenza virus (11.9%). The prevalence of some viruses was subject to geographic and seasonal variations. One-third of positive samples contained more than one virus. CONCLUSIONS: Like most studies in the world, the virus PIVs, EV, RSV, Influenza virus, HRV were predominant among children under five years old in Gabon. An exception is made for adenoviruses which have a high prevalence in our study. However adenoviruses can be detected in asymptomatic persons. These finding gave a better knowledge of the circulation and the seasonality of the viruses involved in ILI in Gabon.","publish_time":"2014-07-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lekana-Douki, Sonia Etenna; Nkoghe, Dieudonn\u00E9; Drosten, Christian; Ngoungou, Edgar Brice; Drexler, Jan Felix; Leroy, Eric M","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9eff33e415aeff95305afd9a4914f15b1eafab84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4107952.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25000832/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Central Africa","Gabon"],"keyphrases":["virus PIVs","circulation of influenza virus","pandemic influenza virus","respiratory syncytial virus","seasonal influenza virus B","parainfluenza viruses","respiratory viruses","Surveillance of influenza","common viruses","patients","Gabon","adenoviruses","human metapneumovirus","human parechovirus","human coronaviruses NL63","children","seasonal variations","cases of ILI","RSV","years old","positive samples","surveillance network","high prevalence","Central African country","multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","pathogens","rhinovirus","HKU1","OC43","H3N2","H1N1","following pairs","analysis","Centre International","major towns","order","illness","HRV","Recherches M\u00E9dicales","Franceville","seasonality","world","better knowledge","Nasal swabs","studies","health centers","total","METHODS","finding","study","data","asymptomatic persons","quarters","BACKGROUND","viral etiology","age group","RESULTS","specimens","CONCLUSIONS","enteroviruses","exception"],"language":"en"},

They are proposed to form stacking interactions with polypurine sequences in the 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of selected mRNAs, thereby clamping the RNA substrate onto eIF4A and causing inhibition of the translation initiation complex. Since virus replication relies on the host translation machinery, it is not surprising that the rocaglate Silvestrol has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Unfortunately, synthesis of Silvestrol is sophisticated and time-consuming, thus hampering the prospects for further antiviral drug development. Here, we present the less complex structured synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (\u2212) as a novel compound with potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity in primary cells and in an ex vivo bronchial epithelial cell system. CR-31-B (\u2212) inhibited the replication of corona-, Zika-, Lassa-, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis E virus (HEV) at non-cytotoxic low nanomolar concentrations. Since HEV has a polypurine-free 5\u2032-UTR that folds into a stable hairpin structure, we hypothesized that RNA clamping by Silvestrol and its derivatives may also occur in a polypurine-independent but structure-dependent manner. Interestingly, the HEV 5\u2032-UTR conferred sensitivity towards Silvestrol but not to CR-31-B (\u2212). However, if an exposed polypurine stretch was introduced into the HEV 5\u2032-UTR, CR-31-B (\u2212) became an active inhibitor comparable to Silvestrol. Moreover, thermodynamic destabilization of the HEV 5\u2032-UTR led to reduced translational inhibition by Silvestrol, suggesting differences between rocaglates in their mode of action, most probably by engaging Silvestrol\u0027s additional dioxane moiety.","publish_time":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FCller, Christin; Obermann, Wiebke; Schulte, Falk W.; Lange-Gr\u00FCnweller, Kerstin; Oestereich, Lisa; Elgner, Fabian; Glitscher, Mirco; Hildt, Eberhard; Singh, Kamini; Wendel, Hans-Guido; Hartmann, Roland K.; Ziebuhr, John; Gr\u00FCnweller, Arnold","journal":"Antiviral Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa264b65408831a37b2943b60805e3773e0acaa5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/0e6ae0a8d406536ff524600906238c537bc20137.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114339.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931103/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354219305480; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354219305480; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104706","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcxLmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1674425,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"QaksE9XOhXnVErykzcak2Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_71.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Silvestrol","HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HEV","UTR","rocaglate Silvestrol","synthesis of Silvestrol","polypurine sequences","polypurine-independent","polypurine-free","translation initiation complex","potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity","potent inhibitors of translation initiation","virus replication","complex structured synthetic rocaglate CR","Rocaglates","exposed polypurine stretch","host translation machinery","antiviral drug development","translational inhibition","RNA substrate","replication of corona","hepatitis E virus","structure-dependent manner","stable hairpin structure","primary cells","Lassa","lesser extent","Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses","non-cytotoxic low nanomolar concentrations","novel compound","plants","genus Aglaia","selected mRNAs","differences","engaging Silvestrol\u0027s additional dioxane moiety","class of natural compounds","bronchial epithelial cell system","Zika","prospects","untranslated region","eIF4A","sensitivity","mode of action","active inhibitor comparable","stacking interactions","derivatives","thermodynamic destabilization"],"language":"en"},

A vaccine can only be made available to the veterinary community once marketing authorisation has been granted by the veterinary authorities. This review gives a brief description of the regulatory requirements which have to be fulfilled before a vaccine can be admitted to the market. Vaccines have to be produced in a quality controlled environment to guarantee delivery of a product of consistent quality with well defined animal and consumer safety and efficacy characteristics. The regulatory and manufacturing legislative framework in which the development takes place is described, as well as the trend in developments in production systems.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) played an important role in the regulation of inflammation in the immune system. To investigate the role of IGF1 in IAV-mediated acute inflammatory lung injury, the expression of IGF1 and inflammatory cytokines was tested after IAV A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1; abbreviated as PR8) infection in A549 cells. Then, a BALB/c mouse model of PR8 infection was established. On days 3, 5, 7, and 9 post-infection, the mice lung tissue was collected to detect the expression changes in IGF1 mRNA and protein. The mice were divided into four groups: (1) PBS (abbreviation of phosphate buffered saline); (2) PR8 \u002B PBS; (3) PR8 \u002B IGF1; and (4) PR8 \u002B PPP (abbreviation of picropodophyllin, the IGF1 receptor inhibitor). The body weight and survival rate of the mice were monitored daily, and the clinical symptoms of the mice were recorded. On day 5 post-infection, the mice were sacrificed to obtain the serum and lung tissues. The expression of inflammatory cytokines in the serum was detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; lung injury was observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining; the viral proliferation in the lung was detected by real-time quantitative PCR; and the protein expression of the main molecules in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways was detected by Western blot. It was found that IGF1 expression is upregulated in A549 cells and BALB/c mice infected with PR8, whereas IGF1 regulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by PR8 infection. Overexpression of IGF1 aggravated the IAV-mediated inflammatory response, whereas the inhibition of IGF1 receptor reduced such inflammatory response. The phosphorylation of IGF1 receptor triggered the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways to induce an inflammatory response after IAV infection. Therefore, IGF1 plays an important immune function in IAV-mediated acute inflammatory lung injury.

In thermal dissociation experiments with cowpea chlorotic mottle virus and probed by small-angle neutron scattering, we observed a slight shrinkage of viral capsids, which can be related to the strengthening of the hydrophobic interaction between subunits at increasing temperature. By considering the temperature dependence of hydrophobic interaction in the homogeneous lattice model, we were able to give a better estimate of the effective charge. In the heterogeneous lattice model, two sets of lattice sites represented different capsid subunits with asymmetric interaction strengths. In that case, the dissociation of capsids was found to shift from a sharp one-step transition to a gradual two-step transition by weakening the hydrophobic interaction between AB and CC subunits. We anticipate that such lattice models will shed further light on the statistical mechanics underlying virus assembly and disassembly.","publish_time":"2017-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Jingzhi; Chevreuil, Maelenn; Combet, Sophie; Lansac, Yves; Tresset, Guillaume","journal":"J Phys Condens Matter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d85f5549fd377f5a3bfdcdc8ba711a2be93ea197.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104912.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104912/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzU4Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["homogeneous lattice model","heterogeneous lattice model","lattice models","dissociation of capsids","temperature dependence of hydrophobic interaction","sets of lattice sites","dissociation of icosahedral viral capsids","asymmetric interaction strengths","CC subunits","different capsid subunits","slight shrinkage of viral capsids","thermal dissociation experiments","virus assembly","increasing temperature","gradual two-step transition","sharp one-step transition","cowpea chlorotic mottle virus","statistical mechanics","small-angle neutron scattering","better estimate","disassembly","AB","effective charge","strengthening","case"],"language":"en"},

Some such studies have been conducted among Western travelers; however, to our knowledge, there have been no reports on Japanese travelers. METHODS: Malaria cases that were diagnosed between April 1999 and December 2005 and were reported to the national infectious disease surveillance body were used as the numerators after grouped into countries of disease acquisition. The denominators, the numbers of Japanese travelers visiting individual countries were derived from the recipient countries and obtained through a Japanese organization. RESULTS: In addition to the well-documented high risks in sub-Saharan countries, our study showed that travelers to Papua New Guinea were exposed to a significantly high risk of malaria. In Asia, Myanmar had the highest risk. Generally, malaria incidence rates among Japanese travelers were lower than those previously reported on Western travelers. However, the rates were rather comparable to the data obtained recently. CONCLUSIONS: These malaria incidence data in travelers should be taken into consideration for pre-travel risk assessment. They need to be constantly updated, and at the same time, limitations in data interpretation that are inherent in various study methodologies should also be clarified.","publish_time":"2008-09-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tada, Yuki; Okabe, Nobuhiko; Kimura, Mikio","journal":"Travel Med Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106141.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Asia"],"keyphrases":["Western travelers","numbers of Japanese travelers","incidence of malaria","malaria incidence data","high risk of malaria","malaria incidence rates","Malaria cases","sub-Saharan countries","individual countries","recipient countries","data interpretation","reliable data","pre-travel risk assessment","Japanese organization","highest risk","countries of disease acquisition","various study methodologies","well-documented high risks","national infectious disease surveillance body","addition","consideration","Country-specific information","limitations","numerators","Papua New Guinea","BACKGROUND","Asia","Myanmar","time","reports","denominators","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHODS","knowledge","studies"],"language":"en"},

Enrichment is often achieved by leukocyte depletion of infected blood prior to storage. However, leukocyte depletion is difficult in low-resource settings and limits analysis to prospectively-collected samples. As a result, approaches such as selective whole genome amplification (sWGA) are being used to enrich for parasite DNA. However, sWGA has had limited success in generating reliable sequencing data from low parasitaemia samples. In this study, enzymatic digestion with MspJI prior to sWGA and whole genome sequencing was evaluated to determine whether this approach improved genome coverage compared to sWGA alone. The potential of sWGA to cause amplification bias in polyclonal infections was also examined. METHODS: DNA extracted from laboratory-created dried blood spots was treated with a modification-dependent restriction endonuclease, MspJI, and filtered via vacuum filtration. Samples were then selectively amplified using a previously reported sWGA protocol and subjected to WGS. Genome coverage statistics were compared between the optimized sWGA approach and the previously reported sWGA approach performed in parallel. Differential amplification by sWGA was assessed by comparing WGS data generated from lab-created mixtures of parasite isolates, from the same geographical region, generated with or without sWGA. RESULTS: MspJI digestion did not enrich for parasite DNA. Samples that underwent vacuum filtration (without MspJI digestion) prior to sWGA had the highest parasite DNA concentration and displayed greater genome coverage compared to MspJI \u002B sWGA and sWGA alone, particularly for low parasitaemia samples. The optimized sWGA (filtration \u002B sWGA) approach was successfully used to generate WGS data from 218 non-leukocyte depleted field samples from Malawi. Sequences from lab-created mixtures of parasites did not show evidence of differential amplification of parasite strains compared to directly sequenced samples. CONCLUSION: This optimized sWGA approach is a reliable method to obtain WGS data from non-leukocyte depleted, low parasitaemia samples. The absence of amplification bias in data generated from mixtures of isolates from the same geographic region suggests that this approach can be appropriately used for molecular epidemiological studies.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah, Zalak; Adams, Matthew; Moser, Kara A.; Shrestha, Biraj; Stucke, Emily M.; Laufer, Miriam K.; Serre, David; Silva, Joana C.; Takala-Harrison, Shannon","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f622ebe31137cf7c83d9d446276c148b15a0795f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6db3a7777b634b1c5d242259783c6850e1d1a51f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106660.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106660/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzYxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["WGS"],"locations":["Malawi"],"keyphrases":["potential of sWGA","optimized sWGA approach","reported sWGA approach","reported sWGA protocol","WGS data","genome amplification","low parasitaemia samples","clinical samples","sequenced samples","genome sequencing","MspJI digestion","reliable sequencing data","mixtures of parasite isolates","non-leukocyte depleted field samples","highest parasite DNA concentration","host DNA","greater genome coverage","Genome coverage statistics","evidence of differential amplification of parasite strains","absence of amplification bias","mixtures of isolates","vacuum filtration","leukocyte depletion of infected blood","low-resource settings","mixtures of parasites","enzymatic digestion","enrichment","reliable method","geographic region","geographical region","dried blood spots","generation of high-quality Plasmodium falciparum","laboratory","limits analysis","Malawi","limited success","modification-dependent restriction endonuclease","storage","approaches","polyclonal infections","study","CONCLUSION","molecular epidemiological studies","METHODS","Sequences","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

In addition to the conventional production system, the analysis also included 5 alternative animal welfare systems representative of the Netherlands. The study was limited to the most prevalent and economically relevant endemic diseases in the broiler farms. Health care costs consisted of losses and expenditures. The study investigated whether higher animal welfare standards increased health care costs, in both absolute and relative terms, and also examined which cost components (losses or expenditures) were affected and, if so, to what extent. The results show that health care costs represent only a small proportion of total production costs in each production system. Losses account for the major part of health care costs, which makes it difficult to detect the actual effect of diseases on total health care costs. We conclude that, although differences in health care costs exist across production systems, health care costs only make a minor contribution to the total production costs relative to other costs, such as feed costs and purchase of 1-d-old chicks.","publish_time":"2014-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gocsik, \u00C9.; Kortes, H.E.; Lansink, A.G.J.M.

When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1,239 replacements (544 transitions, 695 transversions), the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval 50 to 56) compared with the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared with that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, the available data have the power to verify the \u201Cconservative transitions\u201D hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias.","publish_time":"2015-11-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stoltzfus, Arlin; Norris, Ryan W.","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/17049e2a79da977ba66499049abb424a2958ba4d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7107541.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107541/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzY5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nucleotide transitions","underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions","transversions","amino acid replacements","binary conservative-vs","significant effects of amino acid exchangeability","fitness effects of mutations","actual proteins","statistical power","fold bias","effect of selection","pattern","observed bias","study","single-nucleotide mutations","published studies","molecular evolution","available data","individual","direct evidence","explanations","paired growth experiments","radical distinction","minor role","grounds","size","support","chance","biochemical factors","combined set","confidence interval","null expectation"],"language":"en"},

Rapid diagnostic tests with a high sensitivity for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) could lead to improved patient care and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and associated costs. Diagnostic yields, feasibility, and costs of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens in the routine diagnostic work-up for LRTI were determined. Methods. In a randomized controlled trial, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens from patients admitted for antibiotic treatment of LRTI were evaluated by means of real-time PCR for respiratory viruses and atypical pathogens, as well as by conventional diagnostic procedures. Real-time PCR results for patients in the intervention group were reported to the treating physician; results for patients in the control group were not made available. Results. A total of 107 patients (mean age [\u00B1 standard deviation], 63.6 \u00B1 16.3 years) were included, of whom 55 were allocated to the intervention group. The pathogens detected most frequently were influenza virus (14 patients), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8), coronavirus (6), Staphylococcus aureus (5), and rhinoviruses (5). Real-time PCR increased the diagnostic yield from 23 cases (21% of patients) to 47 cases (43% of patients), compared with conventional diagnostic tests. The detection of viral pathogens by PCR was associated with the winter season, less infiltrates on chest radiographs, lower C-reactive protein levels, and shorter duration of symptoms. Use of real-time PCR results resulted in partial or total cessation of antibiotic treatment for 6 patients (11%; 95% confidence interval, 2\u201319), but overall antibiotic use was comparable in the intervention group and the control group (median duration of treatment, 10.0 vs. 9.0 days; P = not significant). Use of real-time PCR increased treatment and diagnostic costs with \u20AC318.17 per patient. Conclusions. Implementation of real-time PCR for the etiological diagnosis of LRTI increased the diagnostic yield considerably, but it did not reduce antibiotic use or costs.","publish_time":"2005-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Oosterheert, Jan Jelrik; van Loon, Anton M.; Schuurman, Rob; Hoepelman, Andy I.

Whereas ARDS is often complicated by nosocomial pneumonia, pulmonary infection is also the most frequent single cause of ARDS. The prevalence of pneumonia during the course of ARDS seems to be particularly high, but whether persons with ARDS are more susceptible to pneumonia or simply have more risk factors remains unknown because of methodological limitations. Recent research suggests that host factors have a major bearing on the development of ARDS. To date, sepsis seems to be the principal link between pneumonia and ARDS. However, prospective observational data on this supposed sequence are not available. The individual role of specific pathogens for the development of ARDS is difficult to assess, because prospective studies are missing.

Results: Four epitopic sites, S599, M137, N66, and N371-404, located in the SARS-coronavirus S, M, and N proteins, respectively, were detected by screening synthesized peptides. Notably, N371 and N385, located at the COOH terminus of the N protein, inhibited binding of antibodies to SARS-coronavirus lysate and bound to antibodies in \u003E94% of samples from SARS study patients. N385 had the highest affinity for forming peptide-antibody complexes with SARS serum. Conclusions: Five peptides from SARS structural proteins, especially two from the COOH terminus of the N protein, appear to be highly immunogenic and may be useful for serologic assays. The identification of these antigenic peptides contributes to the understanding of the immunogenicity and persistence of SARS coronavirus.","publish_time":"2003-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jingqiang; Wen, Jie; Li, Jingxiang; Yin, Jianning; Zhu, Qingyu; Wang, Hao; Yang, Yongkui; Qin, E\u2019de; You, Bo; Li, Wei; Li, Xiaolei; Huang, Shengyong; Yang, Ruifu; Zhang, Xumin; Yang, Ling; Zhang, Ting; Yin, Ye; Cui, Xiaodai; Tang, Xiangjun; Wang, Luoping; He, Bo; Ma, Lianhua; Lei, Tingting; Zeng, Changqing; Fang, Jianqiu; Yu, Jun; Wang, Jian; Yang, Huanming; West, Matthew B; Bhatnagar, Aruni; Lu, Youyong; Xu, Ningzhi; Liu, Siqi","journal":"Clin Chem","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f6de6299608fcce69212b0a26366621a119afbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108193.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108193/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2OzgzMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS serum","persistence of SARS coronavirus","SARS-coronavirus lysate","SARS structural proteins","SARS-coronavirus structural proteins","SARS patient sera","SARS study patients","antigenic peptides","series of synthesized peptides","screening synthesized peptides","N proteins","COOH terminus","immunoreactivities","N385","N371","inhibited binding of antibodies","accurate analytical methods","widespread threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome","peptide-antibody complexes","early diagnosis","S599","safe antiviral vaccine","challenges","M137","human life","amino acid residues","epitopic sites","highest affinity","high hydrophilicity","preventive use","N66","understanding","samples","immunogenicity","Results","Background","ELISA","Conclusions","serologic assays","identification"],"language":"en"},

Influenza B/1/86 was by far the most prevalent pathogen but other viruses including influenza A, paramyxoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus OC-43 were also present, either alone or in combination during the sampling period. Overall, 92 males and 101 females experienced one episode, 12 males and 22 females experienced two episodes and four females experienced three episodes. However, there were only 52 instances of viral or M. pneumoniae infections, of which 37 had a defined aetiology, while the remainder were clinically silent. No bacterial pathogens could be detected from throat swabs taken from 15 of 37 volunteers in whom a viral infection was detected, or from 43 of 70 volunteers who did not experience such infections. The study indicates that major deficiencies in our understanding of the aetiology of respiratory viral illness are probably due to methodological problems in obtaining laboratory diagnoses for many respiratory viruses, and that great difficulties exist in establishing an aetiology for respiratory infections based upon clinical symptoms alone.","publish_time":"1993-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"TANNOCK, G A; REID, A L A; GILLETT, S M; HERD, R; GILLETT, R S; HENSLEY, M J; BARRY, R D; LAWRANCE, I P A; NICHOLS, J; ADAMS, M; HENRY, R L; SAUNDERS, N A","journal":"Fam Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9d571f71c150083f4c87113d9e16c3e326fef6c8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108509/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","respiratory infections","aetiology of respiratory viral illness","respiratory illness patterns","females","respiratory syncytial virus","pneumoniae infections","laboratory diagnoses","defined aetiology","instances of viral","viral infection","episodes","volunteers","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Influenza B","sampling period","paramyxoviruses","coronavirus OC","understanding","methodological problems","population","Australian winter","data","great difficulties","major deficiencies","clinical symptoms","throat swabs","combination","remainder","prevalent pathogen","bacterial pathogens","healthy adults","study","days"],"language":"en"},

Long-recognized agents that remain in research facilities in the 21(st) century include parvoviruses of rats and mice, mouse rotavirus, Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and pinworms. The reasons for their persistence vary with the agent. The resilience of parvoviruses, for example, is due to their resistance to inactivation, their prolonged shedding, and difficulties with detection, especially in C57BL/6 mice. Rotavirus also has marked environmental resistance, but periodic reintroduction into facilities, possibly on bags of feed, bedding, or other supplies or equipment, also seems likely. TMEV is characterized by resistance to inactivation, periodic reintroduction, and relatively long shedding periods. Although MHV remains active in the environment at most a few days, currently prevalent strains are shed in massive quantities and likely transmitted by fomites. Pinworm infestations continue because of prolonged infections, inefficient diagnosis, and the survivability of eggs of some species in the environment. For all of these agents, increases in both interinstitutional shipping and the use of immunodeficient or genetically modified rodents of unknown immune status may contribute to the problem, as might incursions by wild or feral rodents. Elimination of these old enemies will require improved detection, strict adherence to protocols designed to limit the spread of infections, and comprehensive eradication programs.","publish_time":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Clifford, Charles B.; Watson, Julie","journal":"ILAR J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/56538e7290fe9ddc5a0fe54f0e7cabb9214afd25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108581.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108581/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcuY3N2Ozg3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1544489,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:22Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CF9LGYmIBAXC\u002BOAJkrXkRg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_7.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TMEV","MHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prolonged infections","mouse hepatitis virus","Sendai virus","mouse rotavirus","laboratory rodents","periodic reintroduction","prolonged shedding","feral rodents","TMEV","environmental resistance","spread of infections","mice","common infections","inactivation","MHV","North American research facilities","long shedding periods","Theiler\u0027s murine encephalomyelitis virus","improved detection","parvoviruses of rats","resilience of parvoviruses","recognized agents","modified rodents of unknown immune status","biomedical scientists","use of immunodeficient","animals free of adventitious disease","protocols","inefficient diagnosis","old enemies","strict adherence","Mycoplasma pulmonis","massive quantities","prevalent strains","bedding","problem","survivability of eggs","supplies","interinstitutional shipping","incursions","bags of feed","difficulties","comprehensive eradication programs","Pinworm infestations","equipment","days","species","researchers","century","C57BL","example","persistence","fomites","Elimination","pinworms","reasons"],"language":"en"},

During the past 60 years, individuals responsible for NHP importation programs have observed morbidity and mortality typically associated with infectious disease outbreaks. These outbreaks have included infectious agents such as tuberculosis, Herpesvirus sp., simian hemorrhagic fever, and filovirus infections such as the Ebola and Marburg viruses. Some outbreaks have affected both animal and human populations. These epizootics are attributable to a variety of factors, including increased population density, exposure of na\u00EFve populations to new infectious agents, and stress. The practice of quarantining animals arriving in the United States was first applied by individual research programs to improve animal health and ensure the quality of animals entering research programs. The development of government regulations for nonhuman primate quarantine accompanied the recognition that imported NHPs could pose a risk to public health. This article briefly reviews the history of US NHP importation and the factors behind the development of NHP quarantine regulations. The focus is on regulations concerned with infectious disease, public health, and the health of domestic primate colonies. These regulations have had the dual benefit of protecting public health as well as reducing animal morbidity and mortality during importation and quarantine.

Sequence analysis of five CCoV strains showed a high similarity with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) at the N-terminus of the spike protein.

However many of the currently manufactured vaccines relies in classical vaccine technologies (killed or attenuated vaccines) which, under some circumstances, may not be optimal in terms of safety or adequate for widespread application in disease-free countries at risk of disease introduction.

The analysis of gene expression in persistently infected planthoppers might unveil the molecular basis of viral transmission. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) is currently the most accurate and sensitive method used for quantitative gene expression analysis. In order to normalize the resulting quantitative data, reference genes with constant expression during the experimental procedures are needed. RESULTS: Partial sequences of the commonly used reference genes actin (ACT), \u03B11-tubulin (TUB), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1A), ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18) and polyubiquitin C (UBI) from Delphacodes kuscheli, a planthopper capable of persistently transmitting the plant fijivirus Mal de R\u00EDo Cuarto virus (MRCV), were isolated for the first time. Specific RT-qPCR primers were designed and the expression stability of these genes was assayed in MRCV-infective and na\u00EFve planthoppers using geNorm, Normfinder and BestKeeper tools. The overall analysis showed that UBI, followed by 18S and ACT, are the most suitable genes as internal controls for quantitative gene expression studies in MRCV-infective planthoppers, while TUB and EF1A are the most variable ones. Moreover, EF1A was upregulated by MRCV infection. CONCLUSIONS: A RT-qPCR platform for gene expression analysis in the MRCV-infected planthopper vector Delphacodes kuscheli was developed. Our work is the first report on reference gene selection in virus-infected insects, and might serve as a precedent for future gene expression studies on MRCV and other virus-planthopper pathosystems.","publish_time":"2011-06-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maroniche, Guillermo A; Sagad\u00EDn, M\u00F3nica; Mongelli, Vanesa C; Truol, Graciela A; del Vas, Mariana","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/80a8911f3ccc06ddfc7581569014032487688283.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3142240.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21679431/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-8-308","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mal de R\u00EDo"],"organizations":["UBI","TUB","MRCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["analysis of gene expression","quantitative gene expression analysis","quantitative gene expression studies","constant expression","future gene expression studies","expression stability","MRCV-infective planthoppers","infected planthoppers","MRCV infection","reference gene selection","EF1A","MRCV-infected planthopper vector Delphacodes kuscheli","virus-infected insects","RT-qPCR platform","virus-planthopper pathosystems","suitable genes","used reference genes actin","Quantitative real-time RT-PCR","na\u00EFve planthoppers","overall analysis","plant virus species","Specific RT-qPCR primers","resulting quantitative data","R\u00EDo Cuarto virus","planthopper capable","plant fijivirus Mal","internal controls","GAPDH","RPS18","alpha","polyubiquitin C","geNorm","ribosomal protein S18","elongation factor","sensitive method","phosphate dehydrogenase","glyceraldehyde","Normfinder","report","\u03B11-tubulin","Partial sequences","molecular basis of viral transmission","precedent","BestKeeper tools","experimental procedures","crops","order","CONCLUSIONS","variable ones","mechanical damage","RESULTS","work","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

This region in which all of the crossovers occurred represents a small fraction of the distance between the two selection markers used for the isolation of these recombinant viruses. This result suggests that this region may be a preferred site for RNA recombination. The crossover sites are located within and immediately adjacent to a hypervariable area of the gene. This area has undergone deletions of varying sizes in several virus strains which have been passaged either in vivo or in vitro. These results suggest that a similar RNA structure may be involved in the occurrence of both recombination and deletion events.","publish_time":"1990-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banner, Lisa R.; Keck, James G.; Lai, Michael M.C.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2cc04b63c89fb7ef725ebd6bd7450d206e7f0e86.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229090439X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229090439X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs1MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA recombination","recombination sites","mechanism of recombination","precise sites of recombination","gene","region","RNA sequencing of viral genomic RNA","similar RNA structure","crossovers","crossover sites","hypervariable area","deletions of varying sizes","murine coronavirus","series of recombinants","isolation","distance","occurrence","preferred site","virus strains","selection markers","small fraction","results","deletion events","Abstract Coronaviruses","high frequency","peplomer protein","recombinant viruses","half","nucleotides"],"language":"en"},

We outline some of the core dimensions of these resilient health systems4 and their responses to the COVID-19 epidemic. First, after variable periods of adaptation, the three locations took actions to manage the outbreak of a new pathogen. Surveillance systems were readjusted to identify potential cases while public health staff identified their contacts. National laboratory networks developed diagnostic tests once the COVID-19 genetic sequences were published5 and laboratory testing capacity was increased in all three locations, although expansion of the diagnostic capacity to university and large private laboratories in Japan is still ongoing. In Hong Kong, initially, only pneumonia patients without a microbiological diagnosis were tested, but surveillance has been broadened to include all inpatients with pneumonia and a purposively sampled proportion of outpatients and emergency attendees totalling about 1500 per day (Leung GM, unpublished).

Our results showed that several HIV inhibitors such as lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir produce strong interaction with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Furthermore, broad library protease inhibitors obtained from PubChem and ZINC (www.zinc.docking.org) were evaluated.

METHODS: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics. RESULTS: Key recommendations include: Hospitals should increase their ICU beds to the maximal extent by expanding ICU capacity and expanding ICUs into other areas. Hospitals should have appropriate beds and monitors for these expansion areas. Establish a management system with control groups at facility, local, regional and/or national levels to exercise authority over resources. Establish a system of communication, coordination and collaboration between the ICU and key interface departments. A plan to access, coordinate and increase labor resources is required with a central inventory of all clinical and non-clinical staff. Delegate duties not within the usual scope of workers\u2019 practice. Ensure that adequate essential medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and supplies are available. Protect patients and staff with infection control practices and supporting occupational health policies. Maintain staff confidence with reassurance plans for legal protection and assistance.

Numerous surveys have expanded our knowledge of diverse viruses in a range of rodent and bat species, including their origins, evolution, and range of hosts. In this study of pegivirus and human hepatitis-related viruses, liver and serum samples from Vietnamese rodents and bats were examined by PCR and sequencing. Nucleic acids homologous to human hepatitis B, C, E viruses were detected in liver samples of 2 (1.3%) of 157 bats, 38 (8.1%), and 14 (3%) of 470 rodents, respectively. Hepacivirus-like viruses were frequently detected (42.7%) in the bamboo rat, Rhizomys pruinosus, while pegivirus RNA was only evident in 2 (0.3%) of 638 rodent serum samples. Complete or near-complete genome sequences of HBV, HEV and pegivirus homologues closely resembled those previously reported from rodents and bats. However, complete coding region sequences of the rodent hepacivirus-like viruses substantially diverged from all of the currently classified variants and potentially represent a new species in the Hepacivirus genus. Of the viruses identified, their routes of transmission and potential to establish zoonoses remain to be determined.","publish_time":"2018-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Nguyen, Dung; Van Nguyen, Cuong; Bonsall, David; Ngo, Tue Tri; Carrique-Mas, Juan; Pham, Anh Hong; Bryant, Juliet E.; Thwaites, Guy; Baker, Stephen; Woolhouse, Mark; Simmonds, Peter","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5669349639eae4f58b4fecca26fcc271094c70ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5869495.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29495551/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10030102","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2MTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bats","rodent hepacivirus","human hepatitis-related viruses","rodent serum samples","knowledge of diverse viruses","liver samples","range of rodent","Vietnamese rodents","pegivirus RNA","pegivirus homologues","study of pegivirus","Hepacivirus genus","complete genome sequences of HBV","complete coding region sequences","human hepatitis B","new species","bat species","range of hosts","HEV","Nucleic acids homologous","important sources of zoonotic virus infections","Rhizomys pruinosus","mammals","evolution","origins","bamboo rat","routes of transmission","potential","PCR","Numerous surveys","classified variants","zoonoses","humans","sequencing"],"language":"en"},

Only about 30% of the fresh water total is available on earth, in groundwater and surface water, for drinking and other daily human activities as well as industrial and agricultural activities. Further, 20% of the available fresh water is not available to humans living in remote areas, 60% of fresh water cannot be captured, as it comes at inconvenient times and places (e.g., monsoons and floods), and 18% of fresh water is contaminated by human activities. Only about 2% of fresh water is available for usage. Developed countries have advanced technology for water treatment and are thus able to manage the problem of water scarcity to a large extent, but advanced technology is largely unprocurable in developing and undeveloped countries due to cost. Based on the current population growth rate, it has been estimated that over 3.5 billion people will be in a water scarcity condition by 2025. The problem has become exacerbated due to the introduction of various recalcitrant, nondegradable compounds by agricultural and industrial activities. These compounds cannot be removed completely by any current available technologies. Thus, there is an urgent need of easily procurable technology with excellent efficacy in wastewater treatment.","publish_time":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dwevedi, Alka; Kayastha, Arvind M.","journal":"Solutions to Environmental Problems Involving Nanotechnology and Enzyme Technology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e2580d3c40317561ce842a441e275f68d35a04bf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149554.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128131237000037; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128131237000037","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["available fresh water","surface water","fresh water total","problem of water scarcity","water scarcity condition","availability of safe water","agricultural activities","industrial activities","current available technologies","advanced technology","daily human activities","procurable technology","ongoing problem","nondegradable compounds","wastewater treatment","population density","undeveloped countries","current population growth rate","earth","drinking","excellent efficacy","introduction of various recalcitrant","large extent","groundwater","humans","increasing urbanization","remote areas","places","urgent need","monsoons","usage","inconvenient times","floods","cost","people"],"language":"en"},

We report the persistence of a related strain in a captive colony of lesser dawn bats captured in Singapore. Genomic evidence of the virus was detected using targeted enrichment sequencing, and further investigated using deeper, unbiased high throughput sequencing. RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 Singapore shared 96.52% similarity with RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 356 (NC_030886) at the nucleotide level, and had a high prevalence in the captive bat colony. It was detected at five out of six sampling time points across the course of 18 months. A partial segment 1 from an ancestral Pteropine orthoreovirus, p10, makes up the recombinant portion of the virus, which shares high similarity with previously reported RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 strains that were detected in Y\u00FAnnan, China. RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 is an intriguing, cross-family recombinant virus, with a geographical range that expands farther than was previously known. The discovery of RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 in Singapore indicates that this recombinant coronavirus exists in a broad geographical range, and can persist in bat colonies long-term.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paskey, Adrian C; Ng, Justin H J; Rice, Gregory K; Chia, Wan Ni; Philipson, Casandra W; Foo, Randy J H; Cer, Regina Z; Long, Kyle A; Lueder, Matthew R; Lim, Xiao Fang; Frey, Kenneth G; Hamilton, Theron; Anderson, Danielle E; Laing, Eric D; Mendenhall, Ian H; Smith, Gavin J; Wang, Lin-Fa; Bishop-Lilly, Kimberly A","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v12050539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32422932/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Singapore"],"keyphrases":["RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 Singapore","reported RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 strains","Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1","discovery of RoBat","cross-family recombinant virus","cross-family recombinant coronavirus","high similarity","recombinant portion","captive bat colony","high prevalence","Y\u00FAnnan","China","unbiased high throughput sequencing","broad geographical range","bat colonies long-term","captive colony of lesser dawn bats","targeted enrichment sequencing","intriguing","p10","ancestral Pteropine orthoreovirus","related strain","course","partial segment","sampling time points","nucleotide level","months","persistence","Genomic evidence"],"language":"en"},

Among the 36 PTP genes, ptp-h, which was proposed to be the origin of baculovirus ptp belongs to atypical VH1-like dual-specific PTP subset and encodes a catalytic active protein. The maximum expression level of Bmptp-h was at 5th instar and in fat body. Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection potently induced its expression in silkworm larvae and in BmE cells. Knock-down of Bmptp-h by RNA interference significantly inhibited viral replication, and over-expression enhanced viral replication as determined by viral DNA abundance and BmNPV-GFP positive cells.

The purpose of our study was to compare 2 PPE bundles and to evaluate the feasibility of fluorescent markers as an assessment tool for PPE effectiveness. Eight healthcare providers volunteered for this preliminary study. Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 PPE bundles that meet current (October 20, 2014) CDC recommendations. One PPE bundle utilized commercial EVD-recommended components. The other PPE bundle used components already available at local hospitals or retail stores. Participants were also randomized to standard or high volume exposures (HVE) to simulate fluid splash. Each participant was assisted in PPE donning and doffing by an experienced trainer. A training mannequin was contaminated with fluorescent agents to simulate bodily fluids.

The other contamination event was not suspected until black light examination. In spite of a large difference in cost of PPE, the two bundle arms performed similarly. Bundle testing using fluorescent markers could help identify optimal PPE systems.","publish_time":"2014-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bell, Todd; Smoot, John; Patterson, Justin; Smalligan, Roger; Jordan, Richard","journal":"IDCases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/20adef0eed041bd881f8882e07a14ed619140b8a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/73911f586ff7b7f19d315f3a0b2f0521a692c605.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4672605.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26793445/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idcr.2014.12.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214250914000468; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214250914000468","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","CDC","EVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PPE bundles","PPE testing","cost of PPE","PPE donning","PPE arm","PPE effectiveness","optimal PPE systems","Bundle testing","Fluorescent agents","bundle arms","evidence of contamination","contamination events","feasibility of fluorescent markers","fluorescence indicative of contamination","De-gowned participants","commercial EVD-recommended components","black light examination","patient care exercise","training mannequin","preliminary study","HVE","outbreak","local hospitals","assessment tool","content","personal protective equipment","recent Ebola virus disease","high volume exposures","retail stores","large difference","spite","healthcare providers","infection control techniques","usage","bodily fluids","clinical tasks","fluid splash","experienced trainer","CDC recommendations","individual component","contact isolation","purpose"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: A total of 663 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. Among those, 247 (37.3%) had at least one kind of chronic disease. A total of 0.5% (n=3) of patients were diagnosed with mild COVID-19, while 37.8% (251/663), 47.5% (315/663), and 14.2% (94/663) were in moderate, severe, and critical condition, respectively. In our hospital during follow-up, 251 of 663 (37.9%) patients were improved and 25 patients died, leading to a mortality rate of 3.77%.

They are the largest known RNA viruses, with genomes ranging from 25 to 32kb and virions of 118\u2013140nm in diameter. The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Coronavirinae and the Torovirinae. They can be distinguished on the basis of their nucleocapsids as the toroviruses have unique doughnut-shaped nucleocapsids. Virions are roughly spherical and are notable for the large spike (S) glycoprotein that extends from the virus envelope. Current taxonomy places the family in the order Nidovirales. Within the subfamily Coronavirinae are four genera, the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses. All family members share the same unique strategy for mRNA synthesis whereby the polymerase complex jumps or moves from one region of the template to a more distant region. The need for the polymerase complex to dissociate from the template may explain the high rate of RNA recombination that occurs during genome replication. Both the coronaviruses and toroviruses are enteric and respiratory tract pathogens, usually associated with only mild disease (or inapparent infection). However the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus cause severe respiratory diseases.","publish_time":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Payne, Susan","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/27220beddc75ecd095c440c57e5fa839b9dc2c3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149805.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128031094000179; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128031094000179","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs3MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["family members","family Coronaviridae","severe respiratory diseases","Middle East respiratory syndrome","toroviruses","human severe acute respiratory syndrome","respiratory tract pathogens","polymerase complex","template","virions","single-stranded RNA viruses","largest known RNA viruses","unique strategy","large spike","unique doughnut-shaped nucleocapsids","high rate of RNA recombination","Abstract Members","subfamily Coronavirinae","distant region","SARS","MERS","glycoprotein","mRNA synthesis","genera","alpha","genomes","mild disease","gamma","inapparent infection","beta","genome replication","subfamilies","Current taxonomy","order Nidovirales","virus envelope","nm","Torovirinae","need","basis","diameter","deltacoronaviruses"],"language":"en"},

Extensive areas of the plasma membrane surface consist of lipid rafts organized into cholesterol-rich microdomains involved in signal transduction, protein sorting, membrane transport and in many processes of viruses infection. Because of the extraction of cholesterol leads to disorganization of lipid microdomains and to dissociation of proteins bound to the lipid rafts, we investigated the effect of cholesterol depletion by methyl-\u03B2-cyclodextrin (M\u03B2CD) on caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV.1) in three important phases of virus infection such as binding, entry and post-entry. M\u03B2CD treatment did not prejudice virus binding to cells, while a dose-dependent reduction of the virus yield was observed at the virus entry stage, and 30mM M\u03B2CD reduced infectivity evidently. Treatment of MDBK after virus entry revealed a moderate inhibitory effect suggesting that cholesterol is mainly required during virus entry rather than during the post-entry stage. Alteration of the envelope lipid composition affected virus entry and a noticeable reduction in virus infectivity was detected in the presence of 15mM M\u03B2CD. Considering that the recognition of a host cell receptor is a crucial step in the start-up phase of infection, these data are essential for the study of CpHV.1 pathogenesis. To date virus receptors for CpHV.1 have not yet been identified and further investigations are required to state that M\u03B2CD treatment affects the expression of the viral receptors.","publish_time":"2016-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pratelli, Annamaria; Colao, Valeriana","journal":"Virus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dbeb5f044989c196950ab40b6dfe164db2ea1cc3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114551.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26475997/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.10.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215300927; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215300927","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus entry stage","virus binding","virus infectivity","virus yield","herpesvirus entry","date virus receptors","post-entry stage","M\u03B2CD treatment","important phases of virus infection","lipid rafts","viral receptors","cellular receptors","extraction of cholesterol","disorganization of lipid microdomains","cholesterol-rich microdomains","effect of cholesterol depletion","host cells","envelope lipid composition","study of CpHV","Treatment of MDBK","interactions of viral glycoproteins","start-up phase of infection","processes of viruses infection","membrane transport","noticeable reduction","cellular domains","caprine herpesvirus","plasma membrane surface","host cell receptor","moderate inhibitory effect","dose-dependent reduction","signal transduction","crucial step","cyclodextrin","protein sorting","methyl-\u03B2","data","dissociation of proteins","Extensive areas","expression","fusion machinery","recognition","Alteration","presence","pathogenesis","investigations"],"language":"en"},

The global outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 has been an international public health threat. Quick diagnostic tests and specific treatments for SARS are not yet available; thus, prevention is of paramount importance to contain its global spread. This study aimed to determine factors associating with individuals\u0027 practice of the target SARS preventive behavior (facemask wearing). Methods. A total of 1329 adult Chinese residing in Hong Kong were surveyed. The survey instrument included demographic data, measures on the five components of the Health Belief Model, and the practice of the target SARS preventive behavior. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine rates and predictors of facemask wearing. Results. Overall, 61.2% of the respondents reported consistent use of facemasks to prevent SARS. Women, the 50\u201359 age group, and married respondents were more likely to wear facemasks. Three of the five components of the Health Belief Model, namely, perceived susceptibility, cues to action, and perceived benefits, were significant predictors of facemask-wearing even after considering effects of demographic characteristics. Conclusions. The Health Belief Model is useful in identifying determinants of facemask wearing. Findings have significant implications in enhancing the effectiveness of SARS prevention programs.","publish_time":"2004-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Catherine So-kum; Wong, Chi-yan","journal":"Preventive Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73f2fda066f6636e2ba50d8fa90bb098fcc35337.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7133369.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091743504002506; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743504002506","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["Health Belief Model","target SARS preventive behavior","significant predictors of facemask","effectiveness of SARS prevention programs","determinants of facemask","components","international public health threat","individuals\u0027 practice","perceived benefits","perceived susceptibility","global outbreak","married respondents","demographic data","significant implications","global spread","consistent use of facemasks","effects of demographic characteristics","severe acute respiratory syndrome","specific treatments","measures","cues","action","Quick diagnostic tests","adult Chinese","survey instrument","paramount importance","rates","age group","Hong Kong","factors","Logistic regression analyses","total","Findings","Abstract Background","study","Women","Methods","Results","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

In this review, we discuss our research on the host species barrier for these viruses, concentrating on three questions: how does HPAI H5N1 virus transmit from birds to humans; what are the within-host dynamics of HPAI H5N1 virus and pH1N1 virus in humans and other mammals; and what determines transmission of influenza viruses among humans. To contain and eradicate zoonotic influenza viruses requires not only strategic virus surveillance of both animal and human populations, but also a better understanding of the hurdles that such a virus needs to jump over in order to cross the species barrier and cause a human pandemic. Advances in these two areas will allow us to better predict the risk of emergence of zoonotic influenza viruses in the human population.","publish_time":"2011-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kuiken, Thijs; Fouchier, Ron; Rimmelzwaan, Guus; van den Brand, Judith; van Riel, Debby; Osterhaus, Albert","journal":"Hot Topics in Infection and Immunity in Children VIII","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1b195436cb54c05c3efeac4c3b66ff68731ead1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123639.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-0204-6_6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22125035/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["humans","zoonotic influenza viruses","pH1N1 virus","transmission of influenza viruses","host dynamics of HPAI H5N1 virus","strategic virus surveillance","human pandemic","pandemic H1N1 influenza","pathogenic avian influenza","human health","human populations","host species barrier","wild animals","Emerging infections","better understanding","enormous impact","food supply","economics","poultry","research","mammals","risk of emergence","birds","questions","hurdles","order","environment","domestic swine","Advances","areas","review","source"],"language":"en"},

There are currently very limited treatment options for SFTSV infection. We conducted a drug repurposing program by establishing a two-tier test system to rapidly screen a Food and Drug Administration- (FDA)-approved drug library for drug compounds with anti-SFTSV activity in vitro. We identified five drug compounds that inhibited SFTSV replication at low micromolar concentrations, including hexachlorophene, triclosan, regorafenib, eltrombopag, and broxyquinoline. Among them, hexachlorophene was the most potent with an IC(50) of 1.3 \u00B1 0.3 \u00B5M and a selectivity index of 18.7. Mechanistic studies suggested that hexachlorophene was a virus entry inhibitor, which impaired SFTSV entry into host cells by interfering with cell membrane fusion. Molecular docking analysis predicted that the binding of hexachlorophene with the hydrophobic pocket between domain I and domain III of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein was highly stable. The novel antiviral activity and mechanism of hexachlorophene in this study would facilitate the use of hexachlorophene as a lead compound to develop more entry inhibitors with higher anti-SFTSV potency and lower toxicity.","publish_time":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Shuofeng; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Ye, Zi-Wei; Wen, Lei; Tsang, Terance Gi-Wai; Cao, Jianli; Huang, Jingjing; Chan, Chris Chun-Yiu; Chik, Kenn Ka-Heng; Choi, Garnet Kwan-Yue; Cai, Jian-Piao; Yin, Feifei; Chu, Hin; Liang, Mifang; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/376c6616538eb3ae465dbf8ebe62c99193ba5e42.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6520937.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027241/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11040385","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs4Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SFTSV replication","SFTSV infection","impaired SFTSV entry","anti-SFTSV activity","binding of hexachlorophene","drug compounds","mechanism of hexachlorophene","use of hexachlorophene","SFTSV Gc glycoprotein","Drug Administration","higher anti-SFTSV potency","approved drug library","drug repurposing program","entry inhibitors","virus entry inhibitor","domain","severe disease","Severe fever","thrombocytopenia syndrome virus","novel antiviral activity","host cells","humans","FDA","low micromolar concentrations","emerging tick-borne bunyavirus","Food","triclosan","lower toxicity","lead compound","hydrophobic pocket","two-tier test system","case-fatality rates","regorafenib","eltrombopag","limited treatment options","study","cell membrane fusion","Molecular docking analysis","Mechanistic studies","\u00B5M","selectivity index","broxyquinoline"],"language":"en"},

The objective of the current study was to characterize the human cough aerosol pattern with the aim of developing a standard human cough bioaerosol model for Influenza Pandemic control. METHOD: 45 healthy non-smokers participated in the open bench study by giving their best effort cough. A laser diffraction system was used to obtain accurate, time-dependent, quantitative measurements of the size and number of droplets expelled by the cough aerosol. RESULTS: Voluntary coughs generated droplets ranging from 0.1 - 900 microns in size. Droplets of less than one-micron size represent 97% of the total number of measured droplets contained in the cough aerosol. Age, sex, weight, height and corporal mass have no statistically significant effect on the aerosol composition in terms of size and number of droplets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a standard human cough aerosol model. We have quantitatively characterized the pattern, size, and number of droplets present in the most important mode of person-to-person transmission of IRD: the cough bioaerosol.

The proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology provides powerful tools to degrade these \u201Cundruggable\u201D targets and has become a promising approach for drug discovery. However, the PROTAC technology may have limitations and emerging new degrader technologies may greatly broaden the spectrum of targets that could be selectively degraded by harnessing another major degradation pathway in cells.

At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100 000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. DEVELOPMENT: We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term. Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID-19 survivors.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Serrano-Castro, P.J.; Estivill-Torr\u00FAs, G.; Cabezudo-Garc\u00EDa, P.; Reyes-Bueno, J.A.; Ciano Petersen, N.; Aguilar-Castillo, M.J.; Su\u00E1rez-P\u00E9rez, J.; Jim\u00E9nez-Hern\u00E1ndez, M.D.; Moya-Molina, M.\u00C1.; Oliver-Martos, B.; Arrabal-G\u00F3mez, C.; Rodr\u00EDguez de Fonseca, F.","journal":"Neurologia","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e7bf12736930dbd5c24469b00203e26e42c44093.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164900.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32364119/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2020.04.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["impact of SARS","acute infection","neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV","long-term neurological consequences of SARS","pathogenic mechanisms of SARS","cytokine storm","neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin","available evidence","central nervous system","progression of neurodegenerative","consequences of neuroinflammation","speculative review of possible medium","persistent effects","lasting effects","neuroinvasive virus capable","major public health impact","particular emphasis","onset","delayed pandemic","epidemic","effective treatment strategies","potential cause","specific populations","long term","neuropsychological function","COVID","Chinese city of Wuhan","magnitude","people","hypothesis","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSIONS","survivors","deaths","present","DEVELOPMENT","world","Research"],"language":"en"},

Due to biological nature of the novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with faster spreading and unknown transmission pattern, it makes us in a difficulty position to contain the disease transmission globally. To date, we have found it is one of the greatest challenges to human beings in fighting against COVID-19 in the history, because SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in terms of biological features and transmissibility, and also found the containment strategies including the non-pharmaceutical public health measures implemented in China are effective and successful. In order to prevent a potential pandemic-level outbreak of COVID-19, we, as a community of shared future for mankind, recommend for all international leaders to support preparedness in low and middle income countries especially, take strong global interventions by using old approaches or new tools, mobilize global resources to equip hospital facilities and supplies to protect noisome infections and to provide personal protective tools such as facemask to general population, and quickly initiate research projects on drug and vaccine development. We also recommend for the international community to develop better coordination, cooperation, and strong solidarity in the joint efforts of fighting against COVID-19 spreading recommended by the joint mission report of the WHO-China experts, against violating the International Health Regulation (WHO, 2005), and against stigmatization, in order to eventually win the battle against our common enemy \u2014 COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Xu; Ren, Ran; Wang, Youfa; Guo, Yan; Fang, Jing; Wu, Zhong-Dao; Liu, Pei-Long; Han, Tie-Ru","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcf97f7c0bab4dcde54c4841c7defeb2e95646d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7137400.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32264957/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00650-1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzcyLmNzdjs5MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1650609,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"\u002BpGUBpQ4sxRY2bZMXPJECA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_72.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Health Regulation"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","MERS-CoV","international community","outbreak of coronavirus disease","novel coronavirus","provinces of China","China experts","potential pandemic-level outbreak of COVID","International Health Regulation","international leaders","disease transmission","order","strong global interventions","joint efforts of fighting","middle income countries","strong solidarity","new tools","global resources","biological nature","faster spreading","confirmed cases","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","personal protective tools","terms of biological features","joint mission report","unknown transmission pattern","community of shared future","non-pharmaceutical public health measures","old approaches","preparedness","research projects","better coordination","noisome infections","containment strategies","facemask","general population","cooperation","mankind","human beings","hospital facilities","drug","vaccine development","transmissibility","greatest challenges","battle","difficulty position","common enemy","history","stigmatization","continents","date"],"language":"en"},

We performed a national inventory of all Singapore EDs and describe their characteristics and capabilities. METHODS: Singapore EDs accessible to the general public 24/7 were surveyed using the National ED Inventories instrument ( http://www.emnet-nedi.org). ED staff members were asked about ED characteristics with reference to calendar year 2007. RESULTS: Fourteen EDs participated (100% response). All EDs were located in hospitals, and most (92%) were independent departments. One was a psychiatric ED; the rest were general EDs. Among general EDs, all had a contiguous layout, with medical and surgical care provided in one area. All but two EDs saw both adults and children; one ED was adult-only, and the other saw only children. Six were in the public sector and seven in private health-care institutions, with public EDs seeing the majority (78%) of ED patients. Each private ED had an annual patient census of \u003C30,000. These EDs received 2% of ambulances and had an inpatient admission rate of 7%. Each public ED had an annual census of \u003E60,000. They received 98% of ambulances and had an inpatient admission rate of 30%. Two public EDs reported being overcapacity; no private EDs did. For both public and private EDs, availability of consultant resources in EDs was high, while technological resources varied. CONCLUSION: Characteristics and capabilities of Singapore EDs varied and were largely dependent on whether they are in public or private hospitals.

Coinfection of infectious bronchitis live vaccine and H9N2 avian influenza virus led to an extension of the shedding period of H9N2 virus, increasing the severity of clinical signs and mortality rates, causing macroscopic lesions in the embryos.","publish_time":"2008-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Haghighat-Jahromi, M.; Asasi, K.; Nili, H.; Dadras, H.; Shooshtari, A.

Holstein bull calves (n = 120; approximately 3 to 8 d of age) were purchased from sale barns and dairy farms and housed in fiberglass hutches. In addition, wood shavings contaminated with coronavirus were mixed with clean shavings and added to each hutch before the start of the experiment. Calves were fed either a fixed amount (454 g/d) of a 20% crude protein (CP), 20% fat milk replacer to weaning at 28 d or a variable amount (454, 681, 908, and 454 g/d on d 0 to 7, 8 to 14, 15 to 31, and 32 to 41, respectively) of a milk replacer containing 28% CP and 17% fat without or with added dietary supplement containing bovine serum. Calves were also fed commercial calf starter and water ad libitum. Plasma IgG concentration in most calves on arrival at the facility was \u003C 10 g/L. Intake, change in body weight, feed efficiency, morbidity and mortality, and selected plasma metabolites were determined. Body weight at 28 d, 56 d, daily body weight gain, intake of milk replacer, fecal scores, days with diarrhea, and days treated with antibiotics were increased with feeding variable amount of milk replacer over the 56-d study. Starter intake from d 1 to 56 was reduced from 919 to 717 g/d in calves fed fixed and variable amounts of milk replacer, respectively. Morbidity, measured as the number of days that calves had diarrhea, was increased by 53% when a variable amount of milk replacer was fed. Calves fed variable milk replacer were treated with antibiotics for 3.1 d compared with 1.9 d for calves fed 454 g of milk replacer/d. Concentrations of plasma glucose, urea N, and insulin-like growth factor-I were increased when calves were fed variable amount of milk replacer. Dietary supplement containing bovine serum had no effect on any parameter measured. There was no effect of milk replacer feeding on concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, total protein, or growth hormone concentrations. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 was highest in calves with the highest plasma IgG concentrations on the day of arrival and might be related to the calf\u0027s ability to identify pathogens in the environment. Under conditions of this study, calves fed variable amount of milk replacer and exposed to immunological challenge before weaning had greater BW gain, but also increased incidence of diarrhea that required added veterinary treatments.","publish_time":"2010-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Quigley, J.D.; Wolfe, T.A.; Elsasser, T.H.","journal":"J Dairy Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92880f460fcf62a08b4bee70016c2f5328a73297.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164769.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030206720859; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022030206720859","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Holstein"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["variable milk replacer","g of milk replacer","intake of milk replacer","effect of milk replacer","fat milk replacer","variable amounts of milk replacer","effects of increased milk replacer","d study","stressed calves","d of age","Holstein bull calves","Concentrations of plasma glucose","highest plasma IgG concentrations","Starter intake","growth hormone concentrations","growth factor","selected plasma metabolites","added dietary supplement","daily body weight gain","feed efficiency","Plasma tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","bovine serum","morbidity","number of days","incidence of diarrhea","CP","antibiotics","experiment","concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids","total protein","urea N","crude protein","day of arrival","wood shavings","clean shavings","commercial calf starter","greater BW gain","mortality","fecal scores","health parameters","immunological challenge","dairy farms","water ad libitum","coronavirus","insulin","sale barns","pathogens","fiberglass hutches","addition","facility","calf\u0027s ability","veterinary treatments","environment","conditions","objective"],"language":"en"},

Hunan is the northern neighbor of Guangdong Province, where the first SARS case was reported. The custom of consuming wild meat was not common in Hunan 30 years ago. However, in recent years, consumption of wildlife such as snakes has spread to northern China. We handed out 1300 questionnaires between 22 February and 10 May 2002, before the SARS epidemic. Survey sites included the provincial capital, major cities, towns, and villages in Hunan. Another 1300 questionnaires were distributed between 10 March and 10 May 2004, after the SARS epidemic. The 2004 survey covered the same sites as the 2002 survey. Questionnaire recovery rates for the 2002 and 2004 surveys were 81.2% and 84.6%, respectively. The valid return rate was 73.0%. Frog, snake, hare, and pheasant were the wild meats most frequently eaten by local people. At the time of the first survey, more than 80% of interviewees claimed to have eaten frogs. That number had reduced to 60% by the time of the second survey. Monkey, Chinese pangolin, and bear paw were the wild meats least frequently eaten. Although palm civet was suspected to be the carrier of SARS, it was interesting to note that, after the SARS epidemic, the proportion of people surveyed who ate palm civets had declined only slightly. The results of the surveys indicate a low level of conservation consciousness; however, after the SARS and bird flu epidemics, there were obvious changes in the conservation consciousness of people in Hunan Province. We recommend some measures that could be taken to change the habits of people who consume wildlife.","publish_time":"2007-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"YANG, Daode; DAI, Xiaofeng; DENG, Yiping; LU, Weiquan; JIANG, Zhigang","journal":"Integr Zool","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c14d68277e5d26ec266f50e1dc12a90eb81b9fca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-4877.2007.00043.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21396016/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Hunan","China"],"keyphrases":["SARS epidemic","Hunan Province","carrier of SARS","SARS case","Survey sites","conservation consciousness of people","wildlife conservation","wild meats","proportion of people","local people","habits of people","consumption of wildlife","surveys of opinions","northern China","eaten frogs","time","questionnaires","low level of conservation consciousness","northern neighbor of Guangdong Province","custom of consuming wild meat","recent years","palm civets","towns","provincial capital","obvious changes","major cities","bear paw","severe acute respiratory syndrome","bird flu epidemics","Chinese pangolin","hare","villages","pheasant","snakes","Monkey","Questionnaire recovery rates","valid return rate","interviewees","results","number","measures"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, they have been linked to multiple human diseases, highlighting their medical relevance. Therefore, the identification and analysis of this kind of polymorphisms in the human genome has gained high importance in the research community, and an increasing number of studies have been published during the last years. As a consequence of this exhaustive exploration, an association between the presence of some specific SNPs and the susceptibility or severity of many infectious diseases in some risk population groups has been found. In this review, we discuss the relevance of SNPs that are important to understand the pathology derived from influenza A virus (IAV) infections in humans and the susceptibility of some individuals to suffer more severe symptoms. We also discuss the importance of SNPs for IAV vaccine effectiveness.","publish_time":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nogales, Aitor; L.

PorPV persistent infection could facilitate the establishment of secondary infections. The aim of this study was to analyse the pathogenicity of classic swine H1N1 influenza virus (swH1N1) in growing pigs persistently infected with porcine rubulavirus. Conventional six-week-old pigs were intranasally inoculated with PorPV, swH1N1, or PorPV/swH1N1. A mock-infected group was included. The co-infection with swH1N1 was at 44 days post-infection (DPI), right after clinical signs of PorPV infection had stopped. The pigs of the co-infection group presented an increase of clinical signs compared to the simple infection groups. In all infected groups, the most recurrent lung lesion was hyperplasia of the bronchiolar-associated lymphoid tissue and interstitial pneumonia. By means of immunohistochemical evaluation it was possible to demonstrate the presence of the two viral agents infecting simultaneously the bronchiolar epithelium. Viral excretion of PorPV in nasal and oral fluid was recorded at 28 and 52 DPI, respectively. PorPV persisted in several samples from respiratory tissues (RT), secondary lymphoid organs (SLO), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). For swH1N1, the viral excretion in nasal fluids was significantly higher in single-infected swH1N1 pigs than in the co-infected group. However, the co-infection group exhibited an increase in the presence of swH1N1 in RT, SLO, and BALF at two days after co-infection. In conclusion, the results obtained confirm an increase in the clinical signs of infection, and PorPV was observed to impact the spread of swH1N1 in analysed tissues in the early stage of co-infection, although viral shedding was not enhanced. In the present study, the interaction of swH1N1 infection is demonstrated in pigs persistently infected with PorPV.","publish_time":"2016-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rivera-Benitez, Jos\u00E9 Francisco; De la Luz-Armend\u00E1riz, Jazm\u00EDn; Saavedra-Monta\u00F1ez, Manuel; Jasso-Escutia, Miguel \u00C1ngel; S\u00E1nchez-Betancourt, Ivan; P\u00E9rez-Torres, Armando; Reyes-Leyva, Julio; Hern\u00E1ndez, Jes\u00FAs; Mart\u00EDnez-Lara, Atalo; Ram\u00EDrez-Mendoza, Humberto","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/624006b37d3cc62c341bfb1866136940078a14e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117528.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26854342/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113516300050; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113516300050; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2016.01.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interaction of swH1N1 infection","co-infection group","PorPV persistent infection","clinical signs of PorPV infection","clinical signs of infection","presence of swH1N1","single-infected swH1N1 pigs","co-infected group","spread of swH1N1","early stage of co-infection","simple infection groups","days post-infection","Viral excretion of PorPV","swine influenza virus infection","infected groups","mock-infected group","growing pigs","increase of clinical signs","week-old pigs","viral agents","viral shedding","SLO","respiratory tissues","RT","BALF","secondary lymphoid organs","Abstract Porcine rubulavirus","pathogenicity of classic swine H1N1 influenza virus","respiratory disease","analysed tissues","nasal fluids","lymphoid tissue","bronchiolar epithelium","oral fluid","present study","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid","establishment of secondary infections","recurrent lung lesion","hyperplasia","samples","interstitial pneumonia","immunohistochemical evaluation","results","conclusion","aim"],"language":"en"},

Objectives: To confirm this, using conventional and molecular detection methods, and expanding the study to younger children. Study design: One hundred and thirty-two nasal aspirates from 75 children hospitalized for a severe attack of asthma were studied (32 infants, mean age 9.1 months; and 43 children, mean age 5.6 years). According to the virus, a viral isolation technique, immunofluorescence assays (IFA) or both were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E, influenza and parainfluenza virus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used for the detection of rhinovirus, enterovirus, RS virus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E and OC43, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Results: Using IFA and viral isolation techniques, viruses were detected in 33.3% of cases, and by PCR techniques, nucleic acid sequences of virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were obtained in 71.9% of cases. The combination of conventional and molecular techniques detects 81.8% of positive samples. Two organisms were identified in the same nasal sample in 20.4% of the cases. The percentage of detections was higher (85.9%) in the younger group than in the other (77%). The most frequently detected agents were rhinovirus (46.9%) and RS virus (21.2%). Using PCR rather than conventional techniques, the detection rates were increased 5.8- and 1.6-fold in rhinovirus and RS virus infections, respectively. The detection levels of the other organisms are as follows: 9.8, 5.1, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 3.7, and 2.2% for enterovirus, influenza virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively. Conclusion: These results confirm the previously reported high frequency of rhinovirus detection in asthmatic exacerbations in children. They also point out the frequency of RS virus detection, and emphasize the fact that PCR assays may be necessary to diagnose respiratory infections in asthma.","publish_time":"1999-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freymuth, Fran\u00E7ois; Vabret, Astrid; Brouard, Jacques; Toutain, Fabienne; Verdon, Renaud; Petitjean, Joelle; Gouarin, St\u00E9phanie; Duhamel, Jean-Fran\u00E7ois; Guillois, Bernard","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/afe93f0f61df66fce765a48ed5af093074d3b23e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129880.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138665329900030X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S138665329900030X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parainfluenza virus","frequency of RS virus detection","RS virus infections","detection of rhinovirus","high frequency of virus infections","Chlamydia pneumoniae","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","high frequency of rhinovirus detection","PCR techniques","detection rates","detection levels","nucleic acid sequences of virus","conventional techniques","PCR assays","younger children","molecular detection methods","adenovirus","coronavirus","enterovirus","molecular techniques","cases","viral isolation techniques","respiratory infections","exacerbations of asthma","immunofluorescence assays","IFA","mean age","combination of conventional","Results","organisms","severe attack of asthma","asthmatic exacerbations","nasal sample","nasal aspirates","Study design","younger group","detected agents","OC43","months","fact","infants","Polymerase chain reaction","viruses","fold","Abstract Background","years","positive samples","percentage of detections","Conclusion","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

Among various mechanisms that have been considered include immune complex disease, T-cell-mediated, antibodies cross-reacting with vascular endothelium, enhancing antibodies, complement and its products, various soluble mediators including cytokines, selection of virulent strains and virus virulence, but the most favoured are enhancing antibodies and memory T cells in a secondary infection resulting in cytokine tsunami. Whatever the mechanism, it ultimately targets vascular endothelium (making it a battlefield) leading to severe dengue disease. Extensive recent work has been done in vitro on endothelial cell monolayer models to understand the pathophysiology of vascular endothelium during dengue virus (DV) infection that may be translated to help understand the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS.

FSFS is associated with diseases characterized by excessive steroidal hormones that can inhibit collagen synthesis. It is also described concomitantly with severe inflammatory, infectious or neoplastic conditions where the pathogenesis remains largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: To describe three cases of FSFS in cats that become cachectic secondary to different causes without glucocorticoid involvement. To describe the histopathological features of connective tissue for both fragile skin and the skin after healing. RESULTS: All cats developed cachexia in less than two months (body condition score ranging from 1\u20131.5). Concomitant diseases were diagnosed in Case 1 (aspiration pneumonia due to mega\u2010oesophagus) and Case 2 (feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)). In Case 3, malnutrition was suspected as a primary cause. The main histological feature of fragile skin was an atrophic dermis with pale eosinophilic, thin and irregular collagen fibres with numerous red cores observed with Masson\u0027s stain. Elastic fibres were normal. Postrecovery histopathological findings at 11 (Case 1) and six months (Case 3) after diagnosis, indicated normalization of the collagen and of the whole skin as compared with controls.

The infection of cells with srr7 (soluble\u2010receptor\u2010resistant mutant 7) is dependent on a known MHV receptor (MHVR), carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 1a, whereas cl\u20102 shows MHVR\u2010independent infection. Initial viral antigens were detected between 12 and 24 h post\u2010inoculation (p.i) in the infiltrating cells that appeared in the subarachnoidal space of mouse brains infected with viruses. There were no significant differences in the intensity or spread of viral antigens in the inflammatory cells between the two viruses. However, 48 h after infection with cl\u20102, viral antigen\u2010positive cells in the grey matter with the shape of neurons, which do not express MHVR, were detected, while srr7 infection was observed primarily in the white matter.

These antigen\u2010positive cells appeared in the subarachnoidal space prior to viral antigen spread into the brain parenchyma, indicating that viral encephalitis starts with the infection of infiltrating monocytes which express MHVR.

The plant is rich in simple bisphenyl lignans and tricyclic lignans known as cyclolignans. These compounds are responsible for many of the pharmacological activities of extracts of the plants. Some of these activities, namely antiherpes, antioxidant, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory, were known a century ago. Only recently have further studies revealed other crucial activities of the same plant molecules as powerful agents against human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and symptoms of aging. Molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral and anticancer activities have been elucidated and involve the inhibition of SP1 dependent gene transcription. This review summarizes the recent findings on creosote bush lignans.

In this review, we provide the latest views on additional roles of the BAFF system in health and diseases, as well as an update on BAFF and autoimmunity, with particular focus on current clinical trials.","publish_time":"2013-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vincent, Fabien B.; Saulep-Easton, Damien; Figgett, William A.; Fairfax, Kirsten A.; Mackay, Fabienne","journal":"Cytokine \u0026 Growth Factor Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2ff1375efe9600f9c10cd763f0e6d488d50f15eb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108297.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2013.04.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610113000312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23684423/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610113000312","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAFF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of autoimmunity","specific role","SLE-specific","key role","potential roles","additional roles","particular focus","recent approval","novel targeted therapy Belimumab","B cell factor","broader relevance","current clinical trials","systemic lupus erythematosus","infection","cancer","latest views","pharmaceutical successes","allergy","diseases","health","review","background","update","assumption"],"language":"en"},

As such, it is unlikely to reflect the transcriptional complexity of the mouse species. Gene transcription is dynamic and condition-specific; therefore, to better understand the mouse transcriptional response to respiratory virus infection, we infected the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross with either influenza A virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and sequenced lung RNA samples at 2 and 4 days after infection. We found numerous instances of transcripts that were not present in the C57BL/6J reference annotation, indicating that a nontrivial proportion of the mouse genome is transcribed but poorly annotated. Of these novel transcripts, 2150 could be aligned to human or rat genomes, but not to existing mouse genomes, suggesting functionally conserved sequences not yet recorded in mouse genomes. We also found that respiratory virus infection induced differential expression of 4287 splicing junctions, resulting in strain-specific isoform expression. Of these, 59 were influenced by strain-specific mutations within 2 base pairs of key intron\u2013exon boundaries, suggesting cis-regulated expression. Our results reveal the complexity of the transcriptional response to viral infection, previously undocumented genomic elements, and extensive diversity in the response across mouse strains. These findings identify hitherto unexplored transcriptional patterns and undocumented transcripts in genetically diverse mice. Host genetic variation drives the complexity and diversity of the host response by eliciting starkly different transcriptional profiles in response to a viral infection.","publish_time":"2014-06-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Hao; Morrison, Juliet; Ferris, Martin T.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Whitmore, Alan C.; Green, Richard; Thomas, Matthew J.; Tisoncik-Go, Jennifer; Schroth, Gary P.; Pardo-Manuel de Villena, Fernando; Baric, Ralph S.; Heise, Mark T.; Peng, Xinxia; Katze, Michael G.","journal":"G3 (Bethesda)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c9d7e3db46a6026e1554f2fa3df4f93645381e1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4132174.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24902603/; https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.114.011759","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Gene"],"organizations":["Collaborative Cross"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mouse transcriptional response","mouse genomes","mouse strains","mouse transcriptome","diverse mouse species","transcriptional complexity","respiratory virus infection","host response","viral infection","undocumented transcripts","strain-specific isoform expression","unexplored transcriptional patterns","different transcriptional profiles","strain-specific mutations","differential expression","Host genetic variation","condition-specific","C57BL","novel transcripts","rat genomes","cis-regulated expression","numerous instances of transcripts","extensive diversity","diverse mice","existing knowledge","founder strains","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","undocumented genomic elements","J reference annotation","exon boundaries","sequenced lung RNA samples","base pairs of key intron","influenza","Collaborative Cross","splicing junctions","nontrivial proportion","conserved sequences","Gene transcription","days","findings","results"],"language":"en"},

So far, the structure determination of the SARS-CoV NP CTD in solution has been impeded by the poor quality of NMR spectra, especially for aromatic resonances. We have recently developed the stereo-array isotope labeling (SAIL) method to overcome the size problem of NMR structure determination by utilizing a protein exclusively composed of stereo- and regio-specifically isotope-labeled amino acids. Here, we employed the SAIL method to determine the high-quality solution structure of the SARS-CoV NP CTD by NMR. The SAIL protein yielded less crowded and better resolved spectra than uniform 13C and 15N labeling, and enabled the homodimeric solution structure of this protein to be determined. The NMR structure is almost identical with the previously solved crystal structure, except for a disordered putative RNA-binding domain at the N-terminus. Studies of the chemical shift perturbations caused by the binding of single-stranded DNA and mutational analyses have identified the disordered region at the N-termini as the prime site for nucleic acid binding. In addition, residues in the \u03B2-sheet region also showed significant perturbations. Mapping of the locations of these residues onto the helical model observed in the crystal revealed that these two regions are parts of the interior lining of the positively charged helical groove, supporting the hypothesis that the helical oligomer may form in solution.","publish_time":"2008-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takeda, Mitsuhiro; Chang, Chung-ke; Ikeya, Teppei; G\u00FCntert, Peter; Chang, Yuan-hsiang; Hsu, Yen-lan; Huang, Tai-huang; Kainosho, Masatsune","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/58c67994f47dc6c8b552cff7de2892719259ec52.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094413.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283607015938; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2007.11.093; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283607015938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18561946/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP CTD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high-quality solution structure","homodimeric solution structure","SAIL protein","SARS-CoV NP CTD","solved crystal structure","size problem of NMR structure determination","disordered region","binding of single","potential RNA-binding region","N-termini","N-terminus","SAIL method","nucleocapsid protein","disordered putative RNA-binding domain","N-terminal portion","C-terminal domain","nucleic acid binding","residues","poor quality of NMR spectra","dimerization domain","helical groove","helical oligomer","helical model","\u03B2-sheet region","stereo-array isotope","significant perturbations","chemical shift perturbations","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","mutational analyses","prime site","stranded DNA","interior lining","regions","hypothesis","uniform","molecular mass","parts","Studies","locations","aromatic resonances","amino acids","kDa","Mapping","addition"],"language":"en"},

It confers potent, cell-intrinsic resistance to infection by diverse enveloped viruses both in vitro and in vivo, including influenza viruses, West Nile virus, and dengue virus. IFITM3 prevents cytosolic entry of these viruses by blocking complete virus envelope fusion with cell endosome membranes. Although the IFITM locus, which includes IFITM1, -2, -3, and -5, is present in mammalian species, this locus has not been unambiguously identified or functionally characterized in avian species. Here, we show that the IFITM locus exists in chickens and is syntenic with the IFITM locus in mammals. The chicken IFITM3 protein restricts cell infection by influenza A viruses and lyssaviruses to a similar level as its human orthologue. Furthermore, we show that chicken IFITM3 is functional in chicken cells and that knockdown of constitutive expression in chicken fibroblasts results in enhanced infection by influenza A virus. Chicken IFITM2 and -3 are constitutively expressed in all tissues examined, whereas IFITM1 is only expressed in the bursa of Fabricius, gastrointestinal tract, cecal tonsil, and trachea. Despite being highly divergent at the amino acid level, IFITM3 proteins of birds and mammals can restrict replication of viruses that are able to infect different host species, suggesting IFITM proteins may provide a crucial barrier for zoonotic infections.","publish_time":"2013-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, S.

Viral myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium caused by virus infection in the heart. The disease progression of viral myocarditis occurs in three distinct stages: acute viral infection, immune cell infiltration, and cardiac remodelling. Growing evidence suggests a crucial role for host proteolytic machineries in the regulation of the pathogenesis and progression of viral myocarditis in all three stages. Cardiotropic viruses evolve different strategies to subvert host protein degradation systems to achieve successful viral replication. In addition, these proteolytic systems play important roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses during viral infection. Recent evidence also suggests a key role for the ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosome systems as the primary effectors of protein quality control in the regulation of cardiac remodelling. This review summarizes the recent advances in understanding the direct interaction between cardiotropic viruses and host proteolytic systems, with an emphasis on coxsackievirus B3, one of the primary aetiological agents causing viral myocarditis, and highlights possible roles of the host degradation systems in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis and its progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.","publish_time":"2010-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Honglin; Wong, Jerry; Wong, Brian","journal":"Cardiovasc Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e7d221febb0647763c74b251362f013b622dedf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109953.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109953/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozk00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of viral myocarditis","viral pathogenicity","disease progression of viral myocarditis","acute viral infection","host degradation systems","host proteolytic systems","host protein degradation systems","lysosome systems","successful viral replication","central regulators of viral infectivity","primary intracellular protein degradation systems","host proteolytic machineries","ubiquitin-proteasome","Cardiotropic viruses","virus infection","regulation of cardiac remodelling","Recent evidence","primary effectors of protein quality control","primary aetiological agents","crucial role","important roles","possible roles","key role","distinct stages","lysosome pathways","inflammatory disease","recent advances","Growing evidence","immune cell infiltration","adaptive immune responses","activation of innate","direct interaction","different strategies","inflammation","emphasis","myocardium","coxsackievirus B3","addition","review","heart","cardiomyopathy"],"language":"en"},

It was found that synonymous codon and amino acid usage of PhiKZ was distinct from that of P. aeruginosa. In contrast to P. aeruginosa, the third codon position of the synonymous codons of PhiKZ carries mostly A or T base; codon usage bias in PhiKZ is dictated mainly by mutational bias and, to a lesser extent, by translational selection. A cluster analysis of the relative synonymous codon usage values of 16 myoviruses including PhiKZ shows that PhiKZ is evolutionary much closer to Escherichia coli phage T4. Further analysis reveals that the three factors of mean molecular weight, aromaticity and cysteine content are mostly responsible for the variation of amino acid usage in PhiKZ proteins, whereas amino acid usage of P. aeruginosa proteins is mainly governed by grand average of hydropathicity, aromaticity and cysteine content. Based on these observations, we suggest that codons of the phage-like PhiKZ have evolved to preferentially incorporate the smaller amino acid residues into their proteins during translation, thereby economizing the cost of its development in GC-rich P. aeruginosa.","publish_time":"2005-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sau, K.; Sau, S.; Mandal, S.

The newly emerged influenza A(H1N1) virus (new H1N1 virus) is causing the first influenza pandemic of this century. Three influenza pandemics of the previous century caused variable mortality, which largely depended on the development of severe pneumonia. However, the ability of the new H1N1 virus to cause pneumonia is poorly understood. Methods. The new H1N1 virus was inoculated intratracheally into ferrets. Its ability to cause pneumonia was compared with that of seasonal influenza H1N1 virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus by using clinical, virological, and pathological analyses. Results. Our results showed that the new H1N1 virus causes pneumonia in ferrets intermediate in severity between that caused by seasonal H1N1 virus and by HPAI H5N1 virus. The new H1N1 virus replicated well throughout the lower respiratory tract and more extensively than did both seasonal H1N1 virus (which replicated mainly in the bronchi) and HPAI H5N1 virus (which replicated mainly in the alveoli). High loads of new H1N1 virus in lung tissue were associated with diffuse alveolar damage and mortality. Conclusions. The new H1N1 virus may be intrinsically more pathogenic for humans than is seasonal H1N1 virus.","publish_time":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"van den Brand, Judith M.

Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently discovered parvovirus associated with respiratory tract infections in children. We conducted the first systematic prospective clinical and molecular study using nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) and fecal samples. Methods. NPAs negative for influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and coronavirus and fecal samples from patients with acute gastroenteritis were included. On the basis of results from a pilot study using 400 NPAs from all age groups, a prospective 12-month study was conducted to detect HBoV in 1200 NPAs and 1435 fecal samples from patients \u003C18 years old by polymerase chain reaction. The complete genome sequences of HBoVs from 12 NPAs and 12 fecal samples were determined. Results. Of the 400 NPAs collected in the pilot study, 20 (5.0%) were found to contain HBoV, all from children \u003C5 years old. In the subsequent prospective study of pediatric patients, HBoV was detected in 83 (6.9%) of 1200 NPAs. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were equally common. HBoV was detected in 30 (2.1%) of 1435 fecal samples. Fever and watery diarrhea were the most common symptoms. The seasonality of HBoV in NPAs and fecal samples was similar. Codetection with other pathogens occurred in 33% and 56% of NPAs and fecal samples, respectively, from patients with HBoV infection. Genomes of HBoVs from NPAs and fecal samples displayed minimal sequence variations. Conclusions. HBoV was detected in fecal specimens in children with acute gastroenteritis. A single lineage of HBoV was associated with both respiratory tract and enteric infections.","publish_time":"2007-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lau, Susanna K. P.; Yip, Cyril C.

Sustained inflations (SI) and dynamic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were assessed in clinical and animal studies to define the optimal level. Our working hypothesis was that very low gestational age infants (VLGAI) \u003C 32 weeks\u2019 gestation require an individualized lung recruitment based on combining both manoeuvers. METHODS: Between 2014 and 2016, 91 and 72 inborn VLGAI, requiring a respiratory support beyond a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) = 5 cmH2O, were enrolled before and after introducing these manoeuvers based on progressive increase in SI up to 15 s, with simultaneous gradual increase in PEEP up to 15 cmH2O, according to the cardiorespiratory response. Retrospective comparisons of the incidence of mechanical ventilation (MV) \u003C 72 h of life, short-term and before discharge morbidity were then performed. RESULTS: Among extremely low gestational age infants (ELGAI) \u003C 29 weeks\u2019 gestation, the following outcomes decreased significantly: intubation (90 to 55%) and surfactant administration (54 to 12%) in the delivery room, MV (92 to 71%) and its mean duration \u003C 72 h of life (45 h to 13 h), administration of a 2nd dose of surfactant (35 to 12%) and postnatal corticosteroids (52 to 19%), and the rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (23 to 5%). Among VLGAI, all of these results were also significant. Neonatal mortality and morbidity were not different. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, combining two individualized lung recruitment maneuvers at birth was feasible and may be beneficial on short-term and before discharge pulmonary outcomes. A randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm these results.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kanaan, Zalfa; Bloch-Queyrat, Coralie; Boubaya, Marouane; L\u00E9vy, Vincent; Bolot, Pascal; Waszak, Paul","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8268bc9d894cd41a1685e873a001f1ffb222173.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114798.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114798/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["h of life","birth","RESULTS","individualized lung recruitment maneuvers","low gestational age infants","weeks\u2019 gestation","PEEP","MV","inborn VLGAI","cmH2O","manoeuvers","discharge morbidity","surfactant administration","continuous positive airway pressure","respiratory support","respiratory transition","progressive increase","following outcomes","pulmonary outcomes","dose of surfactant","dynamic positive end-expiratory pressure","simultaneous gradual increase","ELGAI","incidence of mechanical ventilation","CPAP","animal studies","setting","Retrospective comparisons","Sustained inflations","effective method","working hypothesis","optimal level","Neonatal mortality","mean duration","BACKGROUND","randomized controlled trial","rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia","cardiorespiratory response","delivery room","intubation","postnatal corticosteroids","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

While the existing literature discusses the potential epidemiological benefits of UIVs, it is also important to anticipate their potential unintended population consequences. Using mathematical modelling, we illustrate two such types of adverse consequences. First, by reducing the amount of infection-induced immunity in a population without fully replacing it, a seasonal UIV programme may permit larger pandemics than in the absence of vaccination. Second, the more successful a future UIV programme is in reducing transmission of seasonal influenza, the more vulnerable the population could become to the emergence of a vaccine escape variant. These risks could be mitigated by optimal deployment of any future UIV vaccine: namely, the use of a combined vaccine formulation (incorporating conventional as well as multiple universal antigenic targets) and achieving sufficient population coverage to compensate for any reductions in infection-induced immunity. In the absence of large-scale trials of UIVs, disease-dynamic models can provide helpful, early insights into their potential impact. In future, data from continuing vaccine development will be invaluable in developing robustly predictive modelling approaches.","publish_time":"2020-03-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arinaminpathy, N.; Riley, S.; Barclay, W.

We also present the electrostatic capture of Vaccinia viruses using the same particle collector and compare these virus measurements with the nanoparticle cases. The most particles were collected in the FO configuration. The numbers of particles captured in the BO and SO configurations were close within their standard deviations.

These results suggest that a multi-subtype vaccine approach may provide the broad-spectrum immunity necessary for vaccine protection against strains from different subtypes.","publish_time":"1998-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hohdatsu, Tsutomu; Okada, Susumu; Motokawa, Kenji; Aizawa, Chikara; Yamamoto, Janet K.; Koyama, Hiroyuki","journal":"Vet Microbiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117228/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Petaluma"],"keyphrases":["Petaluma vaccine","challenged cats","vaccinated cats","dual-subtype vaccine","vaccine protection","vaccine efficacy","naive SPF cats","Petaluma strain","multi-subtype vaccine approach","FIV-specific PCR","FIV infection","Shizuoka strain","FIV-specific antibody profiles","homologous Petaluma challenge","heterologous Shizuoka challenge","Shizuoka challenges","Dual-subtype feline immunodeficiency virus","specific pathogen free","different subtypes","virus-neutralization assays","ELISA","broad-spectrum immunity necessary","strains","viral status","proviral DNA","inaactivated cells","addition","blood","results","Animals"],"language":"en"},

By probing porcine genomic libraries with human and porcine IFN-\u03B1 probes to isolate related genes, we have shown that the porcine IFN-\u03B1 multigene family included, like several other mammalian species, two subfamilies of related but distinct genes. Class I subfamily contains at least 11 loci, located on chromosome no. 1, among which nine have been cloned and two (potentially functional) sequenced. Class II subfamily, which is specifically expressed by the embryo of ruminants before implantation, contains at least seven loci among which six have been cloned. One of the sequenced class I loci: PoIFN-\u03B11 encodes a 189 amino acids (AA) preprotein. After removal of the sequence encoding the putative signal peptide (23 N-terminal AA) this gene was inserted into an Escherichia coli bicistronic expression vector allowing intracellular synthesis of mature porcine IFN-\u03B11 (methionyl IFN-\u03B11). Expression of the recombinant protein was optimized by insertion of a seven base pairs long random synthetic sequence in the intercistronic region, followed by cloning in E. coli and immunodetection of clones expressing high amounts of recombinant protein. The E. coli strain obtained produced high levels of a 18 000 Da protein exhibiting the same in vitro overall biological properties as leucocyte derived porcine IFN (LeuIFN). However, it had a stronger antiviral effect on porcine cells than LeuIFN. After immunoaffinity purification to a specific activity of 5\u221210 \u00D7 10(7) International Units (IU)/mg of protein, pharmacokinetic and pharmacological studies were realized to determine the in vivo half life of this rIFN-\u03B1 in the pig.

The agent has been attenuated by serial passage in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. When attenuated virus is inoculated in 8-week-old C(3)HeJ mice a myelopathy of delayed onset with prominent demyelination of lateral and anterior columns occurs. The DA virus is believed to be related to the Theiler murine encephalomyelitis (TME) viruses because of the similar clinical and pathological conditions which it causes, and because neutralization tests indicate shared antigens between it and GD7, a TME virus. This paper reports electron-microscopic studies of BHK-21 cells infected with DA virus. The cells were prepared 24 and 48 hr after inoculation. Cytopathic effects were observed and infected cells contained plaques consisting of numerous 25 nm virus particles in crystalline array. The virions were exclusively intracytoplasmic and were morphologically indistinguishable from human poliomyelitis virus. These observations appear to establish DA as a picorna virus, related to the TME virus group.

Tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1) can act synergistically with IFN-\u03B3 with respect to class II expression on a variety of cells. As brain cells themselves can secrete TNF-like factors upon stimulation, we examined the effect of TNF-\u03B1 on IFN-\u03B3-mediated class II induction on astrocytes. TNF-\u03B1 alone had no effect on class II expression, but did synergize with IFN-\u03B3 for enhanced expression of class II antigens. The specificity of TNF-\u03B1 activity was demonstrated by blocking the amplifying effect of TNF-\u03B1 with a polyclonal anti-TNF-\u03B1 antibody. Kinetic analysis of the synergistic effect indicated that optimal TNF-\u03B1 enhancement of class II expression was observed when astrocytes were pretreated with IFN-\u03B3 12\u201324 h prior to TNF-\u03B1 addition. A possible mechanism for the synergistic action between IFN-\u03B3 and TNF-\u03B1 may be increased TNF-\u03B1 receptor expression by IFN-\u03B3. Astrocytes treated with IFN-\u03B3 for 24 h express more TNF-\u03B1 receptors (3900/cell) than do untreated astrocytes (2483/cell), with no significant change in the binding affinity (K(d)). These results suggest that the synergistic activity of TNF-\u03B1 requires an inductive signal from IFN-\u03B3, which in part may be increased TNF-\u03B1 receptor expression. Altogether, our observations indicate that TNF-\u03B1 enhances ongoing class II major histocompatibility complex gene expression in rat astrocytes, which in this system is initially induced by IFN-\u03B3. TNF-\u03B1 exerts its effect by binding to high affinity TNF-\u03B1 receptors on astrocytes, whose expression is also enhanced by IFN-\u03B3. These two cytokines work in concert to elevate class II expression on astrocytes, an event which can contribute to initiation and/or perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.","publish_time":"2002-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benveniste, Etty N.; Sparacio, Shaun M.; Bethea, John R.","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119699/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzYwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TNF-\u03B1 addition","IFN-\u03B3","increased TNF-\u03B1 receptor expression","\u03B1 activity","specificity of TNF","optimal TNF-\u03B1 enhancement of class","high affinity TNF-\u03B1 receptors","amplifying effect of TNF","polyclonal anti-TNF-\u03B1 antibody","synergistic activity of TNF","enhanced expression of class","interferon-\u03B3","Tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","ongoing class","mediated class","rat astrocytes","untreated astrocytes","synergistic effect","major histocompatibility complex gene expression","binding affinity","synergistic action","antigens","variety of cells","brain cells","inductive signal","significant change","APC","induction","respect","perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses","possible mechanism","initiation","Kinetic analysis","stimulation","event","concert","system","results","cytokines","factors","observations"],"language":"en"},

When Sindbis virus (SV) is injected intracerebrally into weanling mice it causes an acute non-fatal encephalitis and recovery is primarily dependent on the development of antiviral antibody. We used a modified enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine the number of antibody-secreting cells (ASC) specific for SV and their Ig isotype in brain, spleen and cervical lymph nodes over the course of the acute encephalitis. The numbers of SV-specific ASC peak early in spleen and lymph nodes and then begin to increase in brain, suggesting that initial stimulation of B cells occurs primarily in peripheral lymphoid tissue followed by B cell entry into the circulation and appearance in the brain. The pattern for each individual isotype was similar with peak numbers of SV-specific cells present in the spleen 5\u20137 days after infection, while numbers in the brain continue to rise through day 20 when most ASC were secreting IgG2a or IgA SV-specific antibody. The data suggest therefore that most isotype switching from IgM to IgG and IgA occurs in peripheral lymphoid tissue. An exception to this pattern is IgG1, where numbers of ASC producing IgG1 do not show a peak in spleen and continue to rise in brain through the course of acute encephalitis. The data also indicate that early in infection a large proportion of ASC in the brain are not specific for SV and demonstrate that recruitment of ASC into the CNS is non-specific. However, the percentage of ASC that are specific for SV structural proteins rises steadi throughout the course of encephalitis suggesting that retention of ASC in the CNS is specific or that some portion of the SV-specific antibody response is generated within the CNS.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tyor, William R.; Griffin, Diane E.","journal":"J Neuroimmunol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119766/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzYxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASC","SV","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["specific ASC peak","specific cells","IgA SV-specific antibody","numbers of ASC","brain","SV-specific antibody response","peak numbers of SV","retention of ASC","recruitment of ASC","percentage of ASC","generation of specific antibody responses","spleen","course of acute encephalitis","course of encephalitis","CNS","SV structural proteins","large proportion of ASC","number of antibody","acute non-fatal encephalitis","secreting cells","murine model of acute viral encephalitis","development of antiviral antibody","peripheral lymphoid tissue","individual isotype","Ig isotype","infection","IgG1","pattern","data","initial stimulation of B cells","cervical lymph nodes","secreting IgG2a","B cell entry","recovery","steadi","central nervous system","circulation","appearance","weanling mice","modified enzyme-linked immunoassay","IgM","days","exception","Sindbis virus"],"language":"en"},

The 1918\u20131919 pandemic was associated with more than 500,000 deaths in the USA and an estimated 20\u201340 million deaths worldwide, though some place the global total much higher. In an era when infectious disease mortality had been steadily decreasing, the 1918\u20131919 pandemic caused a large spike in overall population mortality, temporarily reversing decades of progress. The US Department of Health and Human Services, extrapolating from the 1918\u20131919 pandemic to the current US population size and demographics, has estimated that a comparable pandemic today would result in almost two million deaths. Vaccination is an important component of a pandemic response. Public health measures such as reduction of close contacts with others, improved hygiene, and respiratory protection with facemasks or respirators can reduce the risk of exposure and illness (Germann et al. 2006; Ferguson et al. 2006), but would not reduce susceptibility among the population. Prophylaxis with antiviral medications also may prevent illness but depends on the availability of large antiviral drug stockpiles and also does not provide long-term immunity. By contrast, immunization with a well-matched pandemic vaccine would provide active immunity and represent the most durable pandemic response. However, given current timelines for the development of a pandemic influenza vaccine and its production capacity, vaccine is likely not to be available in sufficient quantities to protect the entire population before pandemic outbreaks occur, and thus potentially limited stocks may need to be prioritized. This chapter reviews information on influenza vaccine production capacity, describes approaches used in the USA to set priorities for vaccination in the setting of limited supply, and presents a proposed strategy for prioritization.","publish_time":"2009-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schwartz, Benjamin; Orenstein, Walter A.","journal":"Vaccines for Pandemic Influenza","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53280f7c1287689ed55c52e3ff08c27cd6dedf00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120171.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120171/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ferguson"],"organizations":["USA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pandemic influenza vaccine","pandemic outbreaks","comparable pandemic","well-matched pandemic vaccine","severe influenza pandemic","durable pandemic response","deaths","influenza vaccine production capacity","entire population","overall population mortality","current US population size","illness","Vaccination","USA","US Department of Health","large spike","global impact","active immunity","antiviral medications","current timelines","global total","long-term immunity","limited stocks","availability of large antiviral drug stockpiles","Public health measures","infectious disease mortality","setting of limited supply","improved hygiene","chapter reviews information","reduction of close contacts","respirators","respiratory protection","facemasks","demographics","approaches","development","risk of exposure","sufficient quantities","Germann","Human Services","immunization","important component","proposed strategy","decades of progress","priorities","contrast","prioritization","Prophylaxis","Ferguson","catastrophes","susceptibility"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, synthetic biology uses such models to design synthetic networks, prior to their construction in the cell, to perform specific tasks, or to change a biological process in a desired way.

In this chapter, we describe how to model and predict the behavior of synthetic networks in two difference cases: (1) a synthetic network composed of five genes regulating each other through a variety of regulatory interactions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2) a synthetic transcriptional positive feedback loop stably integrated in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells (HEK293).","publish_time":"2011-07-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"di Bernardo, Diego; Marucci, Lucia; Menolascina, Filippo; Siciliano, Velia","journal":"Synthetic Gene Networks","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/29936f71f67e6979aba13cf990d87d794fcf1791.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120583.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Human Embryonic Kidney"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Synthetic biology","behavior of synthetic networks","biological hypotheses","biological process","biological pathways","synthetic transcriptional positive feedback loop","new biological functions","variety of regulatory interactions","regulatory motifs","development of quantitative mathematical models","Human Embryonic Kidney","yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae","designing","cells","HEK293","observations","living organisms","difference cases","complexity of cellular regulation","different systems","possible behaviors","desired way","parts","construction","genes","specific tasks","coordinated action","chapter"],"language":"en"},

When properly designed and optimized, these siRNAs offer significant protection against respiratory viruses such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Nasally administered siRNA remains within the lung and does not access systemic blood flow, as judged by its absence in other major organs such as liver, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Adverse immune reaction is generally not encountered, especially when immunogenic and/or off-target siRNA sequences and toxic vehicles are avoided. In fact, siRNA against RSV has entered Phase II clinical trials in human with promising results.

These original studies launched the development of murine strains for the two major ectonucleotidases responsible for the generation of airway ADO from ATP release: CD39 and CD73. The dramatic acute lung injury and chronic lung complications, manifested by these knockout mice in response to allergens and endotoxin, demonstrated the critical importance of regulating the availability of ATP and ADO for their receptors. Therapeutic targets are currently evaluated using knockout mice and agonists/antagonists for each ADO receptor (A(1)R, A(2A)R, A(2B)R, and A(3)R) and the predominant ATP receptors (P2Y(2)R and P2X(7)R).

Many, if not most, of all important zoonoses relate in some way to animals in the food production chain. Therefore, the food becomes an important vehicle for many, but not all, of these zoonotic pathogens. One of the major issues in food safety over the latest decennia has been the lack of cross-sectoral collaboration across the food production chain. Major food safety events have been significantly affected by the lack of collaboration between the animal health, the food control, and the human health sector. Examples range from BSE and E. coli outbreaks over dioxin crises to intentional melamine contamination. One Health formulates clearly both the need for and the benefit of cross-sectoral collaboration. In this chapter, we will focus on the human health risk related to zoonotic microorganisms present both in food animals and food from these animals, and typically transmitted to humans through food. We focus on these issues because they are very important in relation to the human disease burden, but also because this is the area where some experience of cross-sectoral collaboration already exist. Food related zoonoses can be separated in three major classes: parasites, bacteria, and viruses. While parasites often relate to very specific animal hosts and contribute significantly to the human disease burden, virus have often been related to major, well-published global outbreaks, e.g. SARS and avian- and swine-influenza. The bacterial zoonoses on the other hand often result in sporadic, but very wide-spread disease cases, resulting in a major disease burden in all countries, e.g. Salmonella and Campylobacter. Next to these traditional zoonotic problems, the use of antimicrobials in (food) animals has also caused the emergence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) zoonotic bacteria. It is important to realize the difference in the nature of disease epidemiology, as well as, in society\u2019s reaction to these diseases in different socio-economic settings. Some diseases have global epidemic\u2014or pandemic\u2014potential, resulting in dramatic action from international organizations and national agricultural\u2014and health authorities in most countries, for instance as was the case with avian influenza. Other diseases relate to the industrialized food production chain and have been\u2014in some settings\u2014dealt with efficiently through farm-to-fork preventive action in the animal sector, e.g. Salmonella. Finally, an important group of zoonotic diseases are \u2018neglected diseases\u2019 in poor settings, while they have been basically eradicated in affluent economies through vaccination and culling policies in the animal sector, e.g. Brucella.","publish_time":"2012-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wielinga, Peter R.; Schlundt, J\u00F8rgen","journal":"One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efb0a2428e01166c9d260429eb2c6a220356dba2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121890.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121890/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzcxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli","Salmonella","Brucella"],"organizations":["Food Safety","SARS","AMR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["food animals","food control","Food related zoonoses","Major food safety events","animal health","industrialized food production chain","human health sector","major disease burden","human disease burden","important zoonoses","important group of zoonotic diseases","human health risk","zoonotic bacteria","animal sector","sectoral collaboration","health authorities","major issues","major classes","lack of collaboration","zoonotic pathogens","disease cases","important vehicle","lack of cross","zoonotic microorganisms present","traditional zoonotic problems","nature of disease epidemiology","experience of cross","benefit of cross","countries","specific animal hosts","avian influenza","parasites","poor settings","bacterial zoonoses","Salmonella","different socio-economic settings","coli outbreaks","dramatic action","well-published global outbreaks","preventive action","global epidemic","swine-influenza","dioxin crises","SARS","culling policies","international organizations","neglected diseases\u2019","intentional melamine contamination","vaccination","potential","pandemic","AMR","use of antimicrobials","latest decennia","emergence of antimicrobial resistant","way","affluent economies","BSE","instance","difference","relation","society\u2019s reaction","hand","farm","need","center","Examples","area","viruses","Campylobacter","Brucella","humans","chapter"],"language":"en"},

Severe falciparum malaria requires rapid parasitological diagnosis by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test (RCT) and prompt initiation of parenteral artesunate. Fluid bolus therapy should be avoided in patients without hypotensive shock, and we suggest initial (24 h) crystalloid fluid therapy of 2\u20134 mL/kg/h, which may subsequently be reduced to 1 mL/kg/h in patients receiving additional fluids, e.g., through enteral tube feeding. In the minority of those patients presenting with hypotensive shock, we suggest fluid bolus therapy (30 mL/kg) with an isotonic crystalloid and early initiation of vasopressor support. Enteral feeding in non-intubated adult patients with cerebral malaria can start after 60 h, to avoid aspiration pneumonia. There are insufficient data to suggest this in pediatric cerebral malaria. The diagnosis of severe dengue is commonly with a combined dengue antigen (NS1) and antibody RDT. No antiviral treatment is currently available. Dengue shock results from capillary leakage, although hemorrhage or depression of myocardial contractility can contribute. The World Health Organization guidelines recommend restoration of the circulation guided by pulse pressure, capillary refill time, hematocrit, and urine output. Large (\u003E15 mL/kg) rapid (\u003C30 min) fluid boluses should be avoided, but prompt fluid administration with crystalloids is essential and should be restricted as soon as the critical phase is over to avoid pulmonary edema.

We used a combined application of this method involving immune-specific signature analysis and HLA-associated peptidomics using samples from six patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in order to select immunogenic HLA epitopes for in vitro testing. Additionally, we applied high-throughput imaging at the single-cell level in order to confirm the immunoreactivity of the selected peptides. The results indicated that this method enabled identification of promising CTL peptides capable of inducing antitumor immunity. This platform combining high-resolution computational analysis, HLA-peptidomics, and high-throughput immunogenicity testing allowed rapid and robust identification of highly immunogenic epitopes and represents a powerful technique for cancer-vaccine development.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Ki-Cheol; Park, Daechan; Ju, Shinyeong; Lee, Young Eun; Heo, Sun-Hee; Kim, Young-Ae; Lee, Ji Eun; Lee, Yuna; Park, Kyong Hwa; Park, Se-Ho; Lee, Hee Jin; Lee, Cheolju; Jang, Mihue","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2835ad4f3cbb18538effff1c3474fb4f4391b455.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125174.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozc4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL","HLA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunogenic HLA epitopes","HLA-peptidomics","immunogenic epitopes","method","HLA-associated peptidomics","cancer-vaccine development","peptidomic analysis","robust identification","order","identification of promising CTL peptides capable","high-throughput immunogenicity testing","high-resolution computational analysis","Identification of tumor antigens","high-throughput imaging","immune-specific signature analysis","triple-negative breast cancer","CTL responses","selected peptides","current algorithmic approaches","human leukocyte antigen","patients","cytotoxic T lymphocytes","TNBC","powerful technique","single-cell level","CTLs","samples","predictive ability","antitumor immunity","immunoreactivity","platform","limited selectivity","combined application","results"],"language":"en"},

However, it is not clear whether curcumin and its derivatives can inhibit neuraminidase (NA) of influenza virus. In this study, a meaningful 3D quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship model (comparative molecular field analysis R(2) = 0.997, q(2) = 0.527, s = 0.064, F = 282.663) was built to understand the chemical\u2013biological interactions between their activities and neuraminidase. Molecular docking was used to predict binding models between curcumin derivatives and neuraminidase. Real-time polymerase chain reactions showed that the five active curcumin derivatives might have direct effects on viral particle infectivity in H1N1-infected lung epithelial (MDCK) cells. Neuraminidase activation assay showed that five active curcumin derivatives decreased H1N1-induced neuraminidase activation in MDCK cells. Indirect immunofluorescence assay indicated that two active curcumin derivatives (tetramethylcurcumin and curcumin) down-regulated the nucleoprotein expression. Curcumin inhibited IAV in vivo. The therapeutic mechanism of curcumin in the treatment of influenza viral pneumonia is related to improving the immune function of infected mice and regulating secretion of tumor necrosis-\u03B1, interleukin-6, and interferon-\u03B3. These results indicate that curcumin derivatives inhibit IAV by blocking neuraminidase in the cellular model and curcumin also has anti-IAV activity in the animal model.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lai, Yanni; Yan, Yiwen; Liao, Shanghui; Li, Yun; Ye, Yi; Liu, Ni; Zhao, Fang; Xu, Peiping","journal":"Arch Pharm Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4017196ee80a233f45df9623bdbd469d81ce0106.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125423.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125423/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozc5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Curcumin","MDCK","IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["active curcumin derivatives","Curcumin inhibited IAV","therapeutic mechanism of curcumin","Neuraminidase activation assay","H1N1-induced neuraminidase activation","activity relationship model","cellular model","animal model","anti-IAV activity","MDCK cells","influenza virus","treatment of influenza viral pneumonia","replication of human influenza","H1N1-infected lung epithelial","Molecular docking","viral particle infectivity","Indirect immunofluorescence assay","immune function of infected mice","comparative molecular field analysis R","direct effects","D quantitative structure","secretion of tumor necrosis-\u03B1","binding models","interleukin","viruses","biological interactions","activities","Real-time polymerase chain reactions","tetramethylcurcumin","chemical","study","IAVs","results","interferon-\u03B3","nucleoprotein expression"],"language":"en"},

Norkurarinol, a lavandulylated flavanone, was isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity. Norkurarinol suppressed the NF-\u03BAB and AP-1 inducible secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity induced by poly(I:C), TLR3 ligand, in THP1-Blue-CD14 cells with IC(50) values of 20.9 \u03BCM. Norkurarinol also significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of proinflammatory and adhesive molecules induced by poly(I:C) and rotavirus infection. Pretreatment of norkurarinol blocked the NF-\u03BAB and AP-1 signaling pathway and the phosphorylation of MAPKs induced by poly(I:C). On the other hand, norkurarinol increased the level of IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN\u03B2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, norkurarinol inhibited the rotavirus-induced cytopathic effects.

OUTCOMES: Outcomes evaluated include need and effectiveness of antibiotics to prevent infections in gynaecologic procedures. EVIDENCE: Medline and The Cochrane Library were searched for articles published between January 1978 and January 2011 on the topic of antibiotic prophylaxis in gynaecologic procedures. Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/ controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to June 2011. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. VALUES: The quality of evidence obtained was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care (Table 1). BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: Guideline implementation should result in a reduction of cost and related harm of administering antibiotics when not required and a reduction of infection and related morbidities when antibiotics have demonstrated a proven benefit. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. All women undergoing an abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy should receive antibiotic prophylaxis. (I-A); 2. All women undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy or laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy should receive prophylactic antibiotics. (III-B); 3. The choice of antibiotic for hysterectomy should be a single dose of a first-generation cephalosporin. If patients are allergic to cephalosporin, then clindamycin, erythromycin, or metronidazole should be used. (I-A); 4. Prophylactic antibiotics should be administered 15 to 60 minutes prior to skin incision. No additional doses are recommended. (I-A); 5. If an open abdominal procedure is lengthy (e.g., \u003E 3 hours), or if the estimated blood loss is \u003E 1500 mL, an additional dose of the prophylactic antibiotic may be given 3 to 4 hours after the initial dose. (III-C); 6. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for laparoscopic procedures that involve no direct access from the abdominal cavity to the uterine cavity or vagina. (l-E); 7. All women undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and/or stress urinary incontinence should receive a single dose of firstgeneration cephalosporin. (III-B); 8. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for hysteroscopic surgery. (II-2D); 9. All women undergoing an induced (therapeutic) surgical abortion should receive prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of postabortal infection. (I-A); 10. Prophylactic antibiotics are not suggested to reduce infectious morbidity following surgery for a missed or incomplete abortion. (I-E); 11. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for insertion of an intrauterine device. (I-E) However, health care professionals could consider screening for sexually transmitted infections in high-risk populations. (III-C); 12. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for an endometrial biopsy. (III-L); 13. The best method to prevent infection after hysterosalpingography is unknown. Women with dilated tubes found at the time of hysterosalpingography are at highest risk, and prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline) should be given. (II-3B); 14. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for urodynamic studies in women at low risk, unless the incidence of urinary tract infection post-urodynamics is \u003E 10%. (1-E); 15. In patients with morbid obesity (BMI \u003E 35 kg/m(2)), doubling the antibiotic dose may be considered. (III-B); 16.. Administration of antibiotics solely to prevent endocarditis is not recommended for patients who undergo a genitourinary procedure.

Both signal and target amplification-based systems are currently used routinely in most if not all virology laboratories. However, commercial assays are only available for a very limited number of targets, and this has resulted in the development and introduction of assays developed in-house for most viral targets. With improved and automated nucleic acid sample isolation techniques, as well as real-time detection methods, a new generation of assays for most clinically important viruses is being developed. These technological improvements also make it possible to generate results with a very short turnaround time. As an example of a more individual-patient disease-management concept, we have introduced in our clinical setting the quantitative detection of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) in T-cell-depleted allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. This has enabled us to develop models for pre-emptive anti-B-cell immunotherapy for EBV reactivation, and for reducing not only the incidence of EBV lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-LPD), but the virus-related mortality. It is now also feasible to introduce molecular testing for those viruses that can easily be detected using classical virological methods, such as culture techniques or antigen detection. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of the additional positive samples detected. It should, however, be clear that a complete exchange of technology is unlikely to occur, and that complementary methods should stay operational, making possible the discovery of new viruses. Furthermore, the ability to characterise viruses more easily by sequencing opens new possibilities for epidemiological studies. There is also an urgent need, with regard to molecular diagnostic methods, for the introduction and use of standardised materials and participation in international quality control programmes.

Although the serological relationships among ruminant pestiviruses require further clarification, there is growing evidence for two antigenic groups, one of which predominates in cattle and one in sheep. The success of pestiviruses stems from the ability of the non-cytopathic (NCP) biotype of the virus to cross the placenta and establish a persistent infection (PI) in the developing foetus. This biotype should be regarded as the \u2018normal\u2019 biotype with the cytopathic (CP) biotype being an abnormal virus that is usually isolated only from PI animals dying from mucosal disease. Recent molecular evidence points to CP viruses arising from their NCP counterparts by recombination events that include the insertion of host RNA and/or the duplication of viral RNA sequences. However, the biological mechanism through which CP viruses kill cells remains unknown. Virtually all CP and NCP viruses cause only mild, transient clinical symptoms in healthy adult animals and stimulate a protective immune response. Despite the urgent requirement for a safe, effective vaccine, there is still no commercial vaccine that has been shown to immunize dams so that foetal infection is prevented. In the absence of an effective vaccine, reliable diagnostic techniques are essential to implement effective control measures. There is now a range of monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for identifying PI or convalescent animals. These tests are specific, rapid, sensitive and reliable but may themselves become redundant as they are superceded by ever-increasing molecular biology-based techniques.","publish_time":"2007-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nettleton, P.F.; Entrican, G.","journal":"Br Vet J","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzI5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI","NCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["biotype","bovine virus diarrhoea virus","NCP viruses","abnormal virus","PI animals","effective vaccine","ruminant pestiviruses","border disease virus","convalescent animals","NCP counterparts","ruminant species","commercial vaccine","healthy adult animals","reliable diagnostic techniques","effective control measures","success of pestiviruses stems","Recent molecular evidence","ever-increasing molecular biology-based techniques","mucosal disease","persistent infection","foetal infection","insertion of host RNA","duplication of viral RNA sequences","range of monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays","transient clinical symptoms","BVDV","ability","BDV","important pathogens","recombination events","protective immune response","cells","clarification","urgent requirement","serological relationships","biological mechanism","tests","placenta","absence","developing foetus","dams","antigenic groups","cattle","sheep"],"language":"en"},

This chapter presents the principal examples of immunopathogenesis caused by the viruses, accompanied by speculations about its management. The most common mechanism of lesion development in virus induced immunopathology involves T cells. Usually, it seems that when CD8(\u002B) T cells act as the controlling cell type, lesions are acute and the outcome is decided quickly. The classic example is provided by LCM in mice. The newest candidate may turn out to be SNV infection in humans. Lesions orchestrated primarily by CD4(\u002B) T cells can be either acute or long-lasting. Curiously, in the LCMV example, if CD8(\u002B) T cells are removed from the scene, immunopathological responses may still occur and these involve CD4(\u002B) T cells. Such responses are far more chronic and of lower grade than those mediated by CD8(\u002B) T lymphocytes. One possible sequel to chronic inflammatory responses to viruses is that autoreactive inflammatory reactions are initiated and an autoimmune disease occurs. The adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure is certainly true in the field of viral pathogenesis. Preventing viral infection or manipulating immune processes during the initial phases of infection is far more successful than attempting to counteract pathological events once underway.","publish_time":"2008-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rouse, Barry T.","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130923/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LCM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["T cells","T lymphocytes","viruses","CD8","viral infection","immunopathological responses","chronic inflammatory responses","SNV infection","lesions","CD4","initial phases of infection","immunopathological mechanisms","classic example","LCMV example","autoreactive inflammatory reactions","field of viral pathogenesis","virus induced immunopathology","common mechanism of lesion development","controlling cell type","immune processes","possible sequel","pound of cure","damage","tissue","scene","principal examples of immunopathogenesis","ounce of prevention","pathological events","chapter","lower grade","autoimmune disease","adage","mice","speculations","humans","outcome","newest candidate","management"],"language":"en"},

It also discusses the structure and function of CD4 and p56(lck) and factors involved in hiv-1-associated cd4 downmodulation. There are, at present, at least three HIV-1 gene products known to be involved in cell surface CD4 downmodulation. These are Nef, Vpu, and gp160. Whereas Nef is expressed during the early phase of HIV-1 gene expression, both Vpu and gp160, which appear to act coordinately, are expressed during the late phase. This functional convergence of HIV-1 proteins on cell surface CD4 downmodulation, whether specific or nonspecific in activity, suggests that this event is of critical importance in the life cycle of HIV-1. Further elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie CD4 cell surface downmodulation may lead to the development of novel strategies aimed at preventing such events, and potentially to the development of new therapeutic approaches.","publish_time":"2008-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Geleziunas, Romas; Bour, Stephane; Wainberg, Mark A.","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131540/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQ3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["associated cd4 downmodulation","cell surface CD4 downmodulation","CD4 cell surface downmodulation","function of CD4","early phase of HIV","life cycle of HIV","functional convergence of HIV","Vpu","gp160","Nef","gene expression","gene products","late phase","development of novel strategies","development of new therapeutic approaches","proteins","p56","human immunodeficiency virus type","lck","mechanisms","critical importance","chapter","activity","events","structure","factors","elucidation","present"],"language":"en"},

Infection of the human CNS with many different viruses or infection of the rodent CNS induces vigorous host-inflammatory responses with recruitment of large numbers of leukocytes, particularly T lymphocytes and macrophages. Chemokines coordinate trafficking of peripheral blood leukocytes by stimulating their chemotaxis, adhesion, extravasation, and other effector functions. In view of these properties, research efforts have turned increasingly to the possible involvement of chemokines in regulating both peripheral tissue and CNS leukocyte migration during viral infection. The biological effects of chemokines are mediated via their interaction with receptors belonging to the family of seven transmembrane (7TM)-spanning, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In the normal mammalian CNS, the number of leukocytes present in the brain is scant. However, these cells are attracted to, and accumulate in, a variety of pathologic states, many involving viral infection. Although leukocyte migration into local tissue compartments, such as the CNS, is a multifactorial process, it has become clear that chemokines are pivotal components of this process, providing a necessary chemotactic signal for leukocyte recruitment.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Asensio, Valerie C.; Campbell, lain L.","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131585/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzQ4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","Chemokines"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS leukocyte migration","rodent CNS","human CNS","viral infection","receptors","normal mammalian CNS","leukocyte recruitment","possible involvement of chemokines","biological effects of chemokines","peripheral tissue","recruitment of large numbers of leukocytes","trafficking of peripheral blood leukocytes","number of leukocytes present","evolution of viral infectious diseases","multifactorial process","local tissue compartments","vigorous host-inflammatory responses","central nervous system","different viruses","spanning","chemotaxis","necessary chemotactic signal","G-protein","T lymphocytes","extravasation","family","adhesion","brain","pivotal components","research efforts","variety of pathologic states","view","properties","GPCRs","macrophages","interaction","effector functions","chapter","cells"],"language":"en"},

Cap structures of the type m(7) GpppN(m)pN(m)p are present at the 5\u2032 ends of nearly all eukaryotic cellular and viral mRNAs. A cap is added to cellular mRNA precursors and to the transcripts of viruses that replicate in the nucleus during the initial phases of transcription and before other processing events, including internal N(6)A methylation, 3\u2032-poly (A) addition, and exon splicing. Despite the variations on the methylation theme, the important biological consequences of a cap structure appear to correlate with the N(7)-methyl on the 5\u2032-terminal G and the two pyrophosphoryl bonds that connect m(7)G in a 5\u2032\u20135\u2032 configuration to the first nucleotide of mRNA. In addition to elucidating the biochemical mechanisms of capping and the downstream effects of this 5\u2032- modification on gene expression, the advent of gene cloning has made available an ever-increasing amount of information on the proteins responsible for producing caps and the functional effects of other cap-related interactions. Genetic approaches have demonstrated the lethal consequences of cap failure in yeasts, and complementation studies have shown the evolutionary functional conservation of capping from unicellular to metazoan organisms.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Furuichi, Yasuhiro; Shatkin, Aaron J","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131690/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzUwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["discovery of cap","Cap structures","cap-related interactions","lethal consequences of cap failure","cellular mRNA precursors","functional effects","nucleotide of mRNA","addition","evolutionary functional conservation of capping","cellular-messenger RNA","biochemical mechanisms of capping","gene expression","methylation theme","downstream effects","viral mRNAs","internal N","terminal G","important biological consequences","advent of gene cloning","complementation studies","yeasts","update of research","processing events","nucleus","initial phases of transcription","information","proteins responsible","caps","modification","transcripts of viruses","metazoan organisms","pyrophosphoryl bonds","Genetic approaches","history","type","GpppN","exon splicing","variations","configuration","poly","chapter"],"language":"en"},

The actual detection of the biogenic amines was on-line and within a temporal resolution of seconds. Simultaneously, the psychostimulant behavior induced by cocaine was studied by infrared photocell beam detection. The results show that cocaine concurrently and significantly increased synaptic concentrations of DA (p \u003C 0.0001) and 5-HT (p \u003C 0.004) in VTA. Serotonin changes were accompanied by a notable oscillatory pattern. Importantly, DA and 5-HT changes in VTA were significantly and positively correlated (p \u003C 0.01). Moreover, psychostimulant behaviors induced by cocaine were significantly increased over control values (p \u003C 0.0001). Psychostimulant behaviors were significantly correlated with concurrently changing synaptic concentrations of DA (p \u003C 0.01) and also with 5-HT to a lesser degree. Additionally, behavioral data indicate that cocaine may exhibit an anxiolytic effect during acute administration because agoraphobic behavior, as shown by increased central ambulatory behavior, was dramatically reduced by cocaine. Summarily, the present findings show that cocaine increased synaptic concentrations of DA in VTA, an action that is correlated with cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior. The DA-ergic effect appears to be tonically maintained. Furthermore, new findings demonstrate a colocalized, cocaine induced 5-HT-ergic effect in VTA, which keeps pace with cocaine-induced alterations in DA-ergic neurotransmission. Thus, 5-HT may be a relay or a gating mechanism for a DA reward signalling pathway for cocaine.","publish_time":"2002-11-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broderick, Patricia A.","journal":"Pharmacol Biochem Behav","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cocaine-induced alterations","synaptic concentrations of DA","DA-ergic effect","VTA","HT-ergic effect","DA-ergic neurotransmission","HT changes","psychostimulant behaviors","DA reward signalling pathway","anxiolytic effect","effect of subcutaneous","agoraphobic behavior","biogenic amines","central ambulatory behavior","Serotonin changes","actual detection","new findings","present findings","infrared photocell beam detection","gating mechanism","acute administration","dopamine","pace","rattus norvegicus","Ventral Tegmental Area","voltammetry","behaving rats","temporal resolution of seconds","notable oscillatory pattern","relay","control values","action","lesser degree","behavioral data","electrochemistry","results"],"language":"en"},

Binding of the PBL to the PK-15 targets used in the single cell cytotoxicity assay for NK activity was not affected by age or by IFN treatment. When newborn piglets were treated with a single intravenous dose at 2 days of age of 0.5 mg/kg of polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid complexed with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC), a synthetic IFN inducer, their IFN levels peaked at 6 h post-induction, and NK activity in their PBL peaked at 24 h post-induction at the level normally found in weaned piglets. The NK activity then declined until 7 days post-induction, when it increased again in a similar manner to that in untreated control piglets. Target-binding of the PBL was not affected by poly ICLC treatment of the piglets. Newborn piglets treated with poly ICLC and subsequently exposed to infection with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus showed a delay in onset of clinical signs of TGE compared with untreated control piglets. It was concluded that NK cells in newborn piglets can be activated by treatment of the piglets with poly ICLC, and that the presence of active NK cells is associated with some increase in resistance to challenge with TGE virus.","publish_time":"2002-11-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lesnick, C.E.; Derbyshire, J.B.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133690/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","IFN","PBL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["newborn piglets","weaned piglets","NK activity of PBL","poly ICLC treatment","untreated control piglets","IFN treatment","cell activity","presence of active NK cells","h post-induction","days post-induction","IFN levels","TGE virus","synthetic IFN inducer","days of age","single cell cytotoxicity assay","onset of clinical signs of TGE","Target-binding","single intravenous dose","peripheral blood lymphocytes","delay","targets","infection","transmissible gastroenteritis","porcine type","interferon","increase","Natural killer","lysine","carboxymethylcellulose","similar manner","polyinosinic","polycytidylic acid","resistance","PK"],"language":"en"},

At first sight this improving health situation follows the classical epidemiological transition model. Just three decades ago health in China was characterised by high rates of infectious disease and early mortality (diseases of poverty) in a mainly peasant society. More recently infectious disease rates have decreased, with corresponding and extended morbidity and mortality associated with an aging population in a rapidly urbanising society. This process has given rise to new health problems, including chronic and degenerative diseases (diseases of affluence). Nonetheless, while there is some validity in the application of the epidemiological transition concept, further analysis demonstrates that China faces a new epidemiological phase, characterised by increasing life expectancy and diseases of affluence coupled with the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases. We demonstrate that China\u2019s state policy plays a major role in defining the parameters of health in a Chinese context. We conclude that, today, China is faced with a new set of health issues, including the impact of smoking, hypertension, the health effects of environmental pollution and the rise of HIV/AIDS; however, state policy remains vital to the health of China\u2019s vast population. The challenge for policy is to maintain health reform whilst tackling the problems associated with rapid urbanisation, widening social and spatial inequalities and the emergence of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2003-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cook, Ian G.; Dummer, Trevor J.B.","journal":"Health Policy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7133822.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133822/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV/AIDS"],"locations":["Republic","China"],"keyphrases":["parameters of health","health reform","new health problems","changing health situation","diseases of affluence","re-emergence of infectious diseases","new set of health issues","health of China\u2019s vast population","degenerative diseases","diseases of poverty","health effects of environmental pollution","infectious disease rates","new epidemiological phase","People\u2019s Republic of China","China\u2019s state policy","high rates of infectious disease","emergence of HIV","rise of HIV","epidemiological transition concept","AIDS","classical epidemiological transition model","early mortality","aging population","urbanising society","peasant society","spatial inequalities","major role","hypertension","analysis","rapid urbanisation","impact of smoking","life expectancy","years","founding","application","extended morbidity","remarkable improvement","PRC","Chinese context","paper","process","validity","sight","challenge","decades"],"language":"en"},

They are responsible not only for the adsorption of virions to cellular receptors, but are also for the entry of the genome into the cell by the fusion of viral envelopes with cellular membranes. Evidence is growing that the fusogenic glycoproteins are frequently activated by cellular proteases. The structure of the proteins at the cleavage site and the availability of a suitable protease are critical for tissue tropism, spread of the virus in the infected organism and, thus, for pathogenicity.

The viruses have a broad tropism for mitotically active cells. In neonatal animals the viruses replicate in a large number of tissues, and FPV infection of the germinal epithelium of the cerebellum leads to cerebellar hypoplasia, while CPV may infect the hearts of neonatal pups, causing myocarditis. In older animals the virus replicates systemically, primarily in the primary and secondary lymphoid tissues, and also in the rapidly replicating cells of the small intestinal epithelial crypts. A transient panleukopenia or relative lymphopenia is often observed after FPV or CPV infection, respectively. Whether the reduction in cell numbers in vivo is due to virus replicating in and killing cells, or due to other indirect effects, is not known. However, FPV kills both erythroid and myeloid colony progenitors in in vitro bone marow cultures, and it has been suggested that virus replication in the myeloid cells in vivo could lead to the reduced neutrophil levels seen after FPV infection of cats.","publish_time":"2006-09-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Parrish, Colin R.","journal":"Baillieres Clin Haematol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134857/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozg3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["replicating cells","FPV infection of cats","myeloid cells","CPV infection","virus replication","Feline panleukopenia virus","active cells","neonatal animals","transient panleukopenia","older animals","myeloid colony progenitors","large number of tissues","secondary lymphoid tissues","hearts of neonatal pups","canine parvovirus","autonomous parvoviruses","bone marow cultures","small intestinal epithelial crypts","reduced neutrophil levels","germinal epithelium","cerebellum","relative lymphopenia","broad tropism","cerebellar hypoplasia","myocarditis","dogs","cell numbers","acute disease","developing immune responses","reduction","days","indirect effects"],"language":"en"},

Virol. 1, 101\u2013108) Objectives: To investigate if the observed lowered IFN producing capacity was secondary to the underlying disease and, consequently, would be normalized after recovery of the child from the chain of infections. Study design: Forty-eight 3\u201312-year-old children suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (acute otitis media included) were followed-up for 2 years. Their clinical condition and virus-induced interferon production in cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes were examined at the beginning and end of this period. Results: In 24 children the health improved strikingly during the follow-up, in 12 children a mild improvement took place, while 12 children remained constantly ill. IFN yields in cultures stimulated with corona- and respiratory syncytical viruses improved along with the clinical situation of the children. Parallel cultures induced with adeno-, influenza A or rhinoviruses did not show a similar correlation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the relationship between interferon production by leukocyte cultures and recurrent infections is complex and may be virus-specific.","publish_time":"1999-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pitk\u00E4ranta, Anne; Karma, Pekka; Hovi, Tapani","journal":"Clin Diagn Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134928/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozg5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recurrent infections","leukocyte cultures","year-old children","recurrent respiratory infections","Parallel cultures","virus-induced interferon production","chain of infections","recurrent upper respiratory tract infections","Lowered yields of virus","cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes","virus-specific","observed lowered IFN","Results","respiratory syncytical viruses","clinical condition","clinical situation","capacity","acute otitis media","corona","relationship","Pitk\u00E4ranta","rhinoviruses","beginning","adeno","mild improvement","place","underlying disease","influenza","follow-up","health","Background","similar correlation","period","end","recovery","Study design","Objectives","Conclusion","Diagn","Virol","years"],"language":"en"},

Later, similar Biotin-EIAs were developed but the sensitivities were unsatisfactory. Objectives: Further optimization of monoclonal Biotin-EIAs and comparison of the optimized assays with TR-FIAs. Study design: Variations in test format, diluents, incubation times and temperatures, and different monoclonal antibodies were tested, and the final comparisons were made with TR-FIA using stored nasopharyngeal aspirates. Results: The improvements in Biotin-EIA featured four changes which increased sensitivity in the assay: (a) test diluent contained diethylenetriamino-pentaacetic acid; (b) antigen and biotinylated detector antibody were added simultaneously; (c) reaction time was extended from 1 h at 37\u00B0C to overnight at 4\u00B0C; (d) from the thirteen monoclonal antibodies used in TR-FIA, ten were optimal also in Biotin-EIA, but in the parainfluenza 1 and 2 assays other monoclonals proved more sensitive. Out of 257 originally positive specimens tested in the comparison studies, 192 (74.7%) were again positive and 54 (21.0%) were negative in both assays; nine were negative in TR-FIA but positive in Biotin-EIA, while two specimens were negative in Biotin-EIA but positive in TR-FIA. The overall agreement between the two assays was 95.7%. Conclusions: All monoclonal Biotin-EIAs can be optimized to the same sensitivity as TR-FIAs for the detection of respiratory viruses. Laboratories which have no TR-FIA expertise may use Biotin-EIA in the diagnosis of acute respiratory infections.","publish_time":"2000-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scalia, Guido; Halonen, Pekka E.; Condorelli, Francesca; Mattila, Marja L.; Hierholzer, John C.","journal":"Clin Diagn Virol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134966/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzkwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TR-FIAs","TR-FIA expertise","optimization of monoclonal Biotin-EIAs","similar Biotin-EIAs","different monoclonal antibodies","positive specimens","optimized assays","Detection of respiratory viruses","laboratories","sensitivity","diagnosis of acute respiratory infections","test format","test diluent","comparison studies","reaction time","daily diagnosis","incubation times","antigen","diluents","temperatures","diethylenetriamino-pentaacetic acid","Variations","fluoroimmunoassay","biotinylated detector antibody","Study design","stored nasopharyngeal aspirates","changes","monoclonals","Background","parainfluenza","final comparisons","improvements","Objectives","Conclusions","years","sensitivities","overall agreement","Results"],"language":"en"},

The actions and cell communication via cytokines in the CNS are designated as the CNS cytokine network, in which microglia and astrocytes play the central roles. To further characterize the CNS cytokine network we investigated the differences in roles of these cells, and found that microglia might contribute to the early phase of cytokine production reaction and that astrocytes might contribute the late phase of the reaction. We also investigated roles of inhibitory cytokines such as TGF \u03B2, IL-4, and IL-10, and showed that each might play a distinct role in the inhibitory regulation in the CNS. We summarized our previous report about cellular distribution of cytokine receptors in the CNS cells and discussed their roles in the CNS cytokine network. Finally, we investigated that expression of IL-6 and IL-2 receptors in neuronal and oligodendrocytic differentiation, respectively. From these results, we discussed the features of the CNS cytokine network.","publish_time":"1999-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sawada, Makoto; Suzumura, Akio; Marunouchi, Tohru","journal":"Int J Dev Neurosci","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135063/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzkyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS","TGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS cytokine network","CNS cells","roles of inhibitory cytokines","central roles","cellular distribution of cytokine receptors","expression of IL","early phase of cytokine production reaction","astrocytes","microglia","Cells resident","inflammatory cytokines","inhibitory regulation","late phase","oligodendrocytic differentiation","differentiation potential","central nervous system","differences","previous report","TGF \u03B2","responses","injury","immunological challenge","cell communication","features","distinct role","actions","growth","results"],"language":"en"},

However, strong immunogenicity and short plasma half-life limit their clinical application. To solve this problem, the two proteins were modified with (mPEG)(2)-Lys-NHS (20 kDa). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this article, a novel purification strategy for the two main type I ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), \u03B1-MMC and MAP30, was successfully developed for laboratory-scale preparation. Using this dramatic method, 200 mg of \u03B1-MMC and about 120 mg of MAP30 was obtained in only one purification process from 200 g of Momordica charantia seeds. The homogeneity and some other properties of the two proteins were assessed by gradient SDS-PAGE, electrospray ionization quadruple mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequence analysis as well as Western blot. Two polyethylene glycol (PEG)ylated proteins were synthesized and purified. Homogeneous mono-, di-, or tri-PEGylated proteins were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The analysis of antitumor and antivirus activities indicated that the serial PEGylated RIPs preserved moderate activities on JAR choriocarcinoma cells and herpes simplex virus-1. Furthermore, both PEGylated proteins showed about 60%\u201370% antitumor and antivirus activities, and at the same time decreased 50%\u201370% immunogenicity when compared with their unmodified counterparts. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: \u03B1-MMC and MAP30 obtained from this novel purification strategy can meet the requirement of a large amount of samples for research. Their chemical modification can solve the problem of strong immunogenicity and meanwhile preserve moderate activities. All these findings suggest the potential application of PEGylated \u03B1-MMC and PEGylated MAP30 as antitumor and antivirus agents. According to these results, PEGylated RIPs can be constructed with nanomaterials to be a targeting drug that can further decrease immunogenicity and side effects. Through nanotechnology we can make them low-release drugs, which can further prolong their half-life period in the human body.","publish_time":"2012-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meng, Yao; Liu, Shuangfeng; Li, Juan; Meng, Yanfa; Zhao, Xiaojun","journal":"Int J Nanomedicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85ea36d6f12f1998c292532c97cc228ee305271f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3396394.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396394/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PEGylated MAP30","antivirus activities","tri-PEGylated proteins","potential application of PEGylated \u03B1-MMC","moderate activities","serial PEGylated RIPs","analysis of antitumor","ribosome-inactivating proteins","problem of strong immunogenicity","antivirus agents","novel purification strategy","purification process","g of Momordica charantia seeds","flight mass spectrometry","electrospray ionization quadruple mass spectrometry","laser desorption ionization-time","RNA-N","N-terminal sequence analysis","momordica anti-HIV protein","clinical application","half-life period","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","short plasma half-life","JAR choriocarcinoma cells","main type","gradient SDS-PAGE","herpes simplex virus","requirement","article","matrix","polyethylene glycol","nanomaterials","Alpha-momorcharin","SIGNIFICANCE","Western blot","samples","human body","glycosidase activity","targeting drug","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","Lys-NHS","chemical modification","low-release drugs","laboratory-scale preparation","kDa","research","METHODOLOGY","unmodified counterparts","dramatic method","properties","mPEG","results","Homogeneous mono","homogeneity","nanotechnology","effects"],"language":"en"},

Cycle thresholds (Cts) of the MS2 were determined for RNA extracted from stool suspensions containing unknown (n = 93) or varying amounts of inhibitors (n = 92). Stool suspensions from the latter group were also used to determine whether MS-2 and enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibitions were correlated. Specifically 23 RNA extracts from stool suspensions were spiked with enterovirus RNA after extraction and 13 of these stool suspension were spiked with intact enterovirus before extraction. MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition varied for RNAs extracted by the different systems. Inhibition was noted in 12 (13.0%), 26 (28.3%), 7 (7.6%), and 7 (7.6%) of the first 93 RNA extracts, and 58 (63.0%), 55 (59.8%), 37 (40.2%) and 30 (32.6%) of the second 92 extracts for A, B, C, and D, respectively.

Here we employed arrayed whole-genome siRNA screening strategies to identify cell-autonomous molecular components that are subverted to support H1N1 influenza A virus infection of human bronchial epithelial cells. Integration across relevant public data sets exposed druggable gene products required for epithelial cell infection or required for viral proteins to deflect host cell suicide checkpoint activation. Pharmacological inhibition of representative targets, RGGT and CHEK1, resulted in significant protection against infection of human epithelial cells by the A/WS/33 virus.

Conversely, far less attention has been paid to pathogen transmission from domestic animals to wildlife. Here, we focus on the case of game restocking, which implies the release of millions of animals worldwide each year. We conducted a 2-year study in the Camargue (Southern France) to investigate the influence of hand-reared Mallard releases on avian influenza virus dynamics in surrounding wildlife. We sampled Mallards (cloacal swabs) from several game duck facilities in 2009 and 2010 before their release. A very high (99%) infection rate caused by an H10N7 strain was detected in the game bird facility we sampled in 2009. We did not detect this strain in shot ducks we sampled, neither during the 2008/2009 nor the 2009/2010 hunting seasons. In 2010 infection rates ranged from 0 to 24% in hand-reared ducks. The 2009 H10N7 strain was fully sequenced. It results from multiple reassortment events between Eurasian low pathogenic strains. Interestingly, H10N7 strains had previously caused human infections in Egypt and Australia. The H10 and N7 segments we sequenced were clearly distinct from the Australian ones but they belonged to the same large cluster as the Egyptian ones. We did not observe any mutation linked to increased virulence, transmission to mammals, or antiviral resistance in the H10N7 strain we identified. Our results indicate that the potential role of hand-reared Mallards in influenza virus epizootics must be taken into account given the likely risk of viral exchange between game bird facilities and wild habitats, owing to duck rearing conditions. Measures implemented to limit transmission from wildlife to domestic animals as well as measures to control transmission from domestic animals to wild ones need to be equally reinforced.","publish_time":"2012-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vittecoq, Marion; Grandhomme, Viviane; Champagnon, Jocelyn; Guillemain, Matthieu; Crescenzo-Chaigne, Bernadette; Renaud, Fran\u00E7ois; Thomas, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Gauthier-Clerc, Michel; van der Werf, Sylvie","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65438bb97d2ff9725a706241b92f3be6f695f368.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3428329.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3428329/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU3MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southern France","Australia"],"keyphrases":["domestic animals","role of wildlife","H10N7 strains","emerging pathogen transmission","game bird facilities","hand-reared ducks","game duck facilities","reared Mallards","surrounding wildlife","wild ones","game bird facility","influence of hand","potential role of hand","case of game restocking","Egyptian ones","Measures","Australian ones","results","reared Mallard releases","influenza virus epizootics","avian influenza virus dynamics","wild habitats","year study","release of millions","infection rates","shot ducks","Eurasian low pathogenic strains","likely risk of viral exchange","multiple reassortment events","account","mammals","human infections","Southern France","cloacal swabs","Camargue","increased virulence","antiviral resistance","N7 segments","large cluster","mutation","rearing conditions","decade","attention","hunting seasons"],"language":"en"},

We characterize the transmissibility of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (hereafter pH1N1) in South Africa during 2009 by estimating the serial interval (SI), the initial effective reproductive number (initial R(t)) and the temporal variation of R(t). METHODS: We make use of data from a central registry of all pH1N1 laboratory-confirmed cases detected throughout South Africa. Whenever date of symptom onset is missing, we estimate it from the date of specimen collection using a multiple imputation approach repeated 100 times for each missing value. We apply a likelihood-based method (method 1) for simultaneous estimation of initial R(t) and the SI; estimate initial R(t) from SI distributions established from prior field studies (method 2); and the Wallinga and Teunis method (method 3) to model the temporal variation of R(t). RESULTS: 12,360 confirmed pH1N1 cases were reported in the central registry. During the period of exponential growth of the epidemic (June 21 to August 3, 2009), we simultaneously estimate a mean R(t) of 1.47 (95% CI: 1.30\u20131.72) and mean SI of 2.78 days (95% CI: 1.80\u20133.75) (method 1). Field studies found a mean SI of 2.3 days between primary cases and laboratory-confirmed secondary cases, and 2.7 days when considering both suspected and confirmed secondary cases. Incorporating the SI estimate from field studies using laboratory-confirmed cases, we found an initial R(t) of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.38\u20131.49) (method 2). The mean R(t) peaked at 2.91 (95% CI: 0.85\u20132.91) on June 21, as the epidemic commenced, and R(t)\u003E1 was sustained until August 22 (method 3). CONCLUSIONS: Transmissibility characteristics of pH1N1 in South Africa are similar to estimates reported by countries outside of Africa. Estimations using the likelihood-based method are in agreement with field findings.","publish_time":"2012-11-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Archer, Brett N.; Tempia, Stefano; White, Laura F.; Pagano, Marcello; Cohen, Cheryl","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab0550f67f34bd6484d7a24b253c8a3e12759b0f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3500305.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3500305/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Africa","Africa"],"keyphrases":["mean R","mean SI","SI estimate","confirmed pH1N1 cases","Teunis method","temporal variation of R","likelihood-based method","secondary cases","simultaneous estimation of initial R","SI distributions","pH1N1 laboratory","primary cases","South Africa","days","Transmissibility characteristics of pH1N1","prior field studies","field findings","initial effective reproductive number","transmissibility of influenza","central registry","epidemic","transmissibility parameters of past pandemics","missing value","date of specimen collection","date of symptom onset","diverse geographic sites","multiple imputation approach","responses","times","estimates","agreement","OBJECTIVE","use of data","pdm09","Wallinga","future outbreaks","period of exponential growth","BACKGROUND","countries","CONCLUSIONS","serial interval","Estimations","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Therefore it is important to understand the pathology underlying the development of CM and SMA, as opposed to uncomplicated malaria (UM). Different host responses to infection are likely to be reflected in plasma proteome-patterns that associate with clinical status and therefore provide indicators of the pathogenesis of these syndromes. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Plasma and comprehensive clinical data for discovery and validation cohorts were obtained as part of a prospective case-control study of severe childhood malaria at the main tertiary hospital of the city of Ibadan, an urban and densely populated holoendemic malaria area in Nigeria. A total of 946 children participated in this study. Plasma was subjected to high-throughput proteomic profiling. Statistical pattern-recognition methods were used to find proteome-patterns that defined disease groups. Plasma proteome-patterns accurately distinguished children with CM and with SMA from those with UM, and from healthy or severely ill malaria-negative children.

Stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) belong to a novel family of cellular structures collectively known as mRNA silencing foci that harbour repressed mRNAs and their associated proteins. SGs and PBs are highly dynamic and they form upon stress and dissolve thus releasing the repressed mRNAs according to changes in cell physiology. In addition, aggregates containing abnormal proteins are frequent in neurodegenerative disorders. In spite of the growing relevance of these supramolecular aggregates to diverse cellular functions a reliable automated tool for their systematic analysis is lacking. Here we report a MATLAB Script termed BUHO for the high-throughput image analysis of cellular foci. We used BUHO to assess the number, size and distribution of distinct objects with minimal deviation from manually obtained parameters. BUHO successfully addressed the induction of both SGs and PBs in mammalian and insect cells exposed to different stress stimuli. We also used BUHO to assess the dynamics of specific mRNA-silencing foci termed Smaug 1 foci (S-foci) in primary neurons upon synaptic stimulation. Finally, we used BUHO to analyze the role of candidate genes on SG formation in an RNAi-based experiment. We found that FAK56D, GCN2 and PP1 govern SG formation. The role of PP1 is conserved in mammalian cells as judged by the effect of the PP1 inhibitor salubrinal, and involves dephosphorylation of the translation factor eIF2\u03B1. All these experiments were analyzed manually and by BUHO and the results differed in less than 5% of the average value. The automated analysis by this user-friendly method will allow high-throughput image processing in short times by providing a robust, flexible and reliable alternative to the laborious and sometimes unfeasible visual scrutiny.","publish_time":"2012-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perez-Pepe, Marcelo; Slomiansky, Victoria; Loschi, Mariela; Luchelli, Luciana; Neme, Maximiliano; Thomas, Mar\u00EDa Gabriela; Boccaccio, Graciela Lidia","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa2d1de5f5f45ad793fffda7679200d35e971b4f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3527446.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527446/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SG","BUHO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S-foci","mRNA silencing foci","reversible formation of foci","high-throughput image analysis of cellular foci","PBs","SGs","SG formation","automated analysis","role of PP1","MATLAB Script termed BUHO","dynamics of specific mRNA-silencing foci","high-throughput image processing","repressed mRNAs","abnormal proteins","mammalian cells","associated proteins","different stress stimuli","systematic analysis","Stress granules","diverse cellular functions","reliable automated tool","PP1 inhibitor salubrinal","reliable alternative","supramolecular aggregates","insect cells","novel family of cellular structures","processing bodies","different metabolic processes","role of candidate genes","Smaug","dephosphorylation","short times","distribution of distinct objects","user-friendly method","minimal deviation","size","primary neurons","effect","filaments","growing relevance","changes","RNAi-based experiment","number","GCN2","synaptic stimulation","cell physiology","unfeasible visual scrutiny","nucleus","translation factor eIF2\u03B1","neurodegenerative disorders","FAK56D","addition","dissolve","induction","spite","parameters","average value","cytoplasm","experiments","results"],"language":"en"},

Recent genetic evidence, however, has indicated a correlation between certain natural killer (NK) cell receptors and progression of both HIV and HCV infection(1\u20133), implying that NK cells are playing a role in these T cell-associated diseases. While direct NK cell-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells may contribute to anti-viral defense during some virus infections, especially murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections in mice and perhaps HIV in humans(4\u20135), NK cells have also been suspected as having immunoregulatory functions. For instance, NK cells may indirectly regulate T cell responses by lysing MCMV-infected antigen-presenting cells(6\u20137). In contrast to MCMV, lymphocytic choromeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice seems resistant to any direct anti-viral effects of NK cells(5,8). Here the roles of NK cells in regulating T cell-dependent viral persistence and immunopathology were examined in mice infected with LCMV, an established model for HIV and HCV infections in humans. We describe a three-way interaction, whereby activated NK cells cytolytically eliminate activated CD4 T cells that affect CD8 T-cell function and exhaustion. At high virus dose NK cells prevented fatal pathology while enabling T-cell exhaustion and viral persistence, but at a medium dose NK cells paradoxically facilitated lethal T cell-mediated pathology. Thus, NK cells can act as rheostats, regulating CD4 T cell-mediated support for the anti-viral CD8 T cells that control viral pathogenesis and persistence.","publish_time":"2011-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waggoner, Stephen N.; Cornberg, Markus; Selin, Liisa K.; Welsh, Raymond M.","journal":"Nature","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d207b14f92ffce3c151c86f9483c159065e0646.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7eda5983227631fbb80f7ccc01c9f4c61cda3afc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3539796.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NK","HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Anti-viral T cells","activated NK cells","roles of NK cells","infected cells","anti-viral CD8 T cells","T-cell exhaustion","activated CD4 T cells","medium dose NK cells","T cell responses","direct anti-viral effects of NK cells","high virus dose NK cells","T cell-dependent viral persistence","CD8 T-cell function","T cell-associated diseases","direct NK cell-mediated lysis of virus","CD4 T cell-mediated support","lethal T cell-mediated pathology","cell receptors","viral control","virus infections","viral pathogenesis","anti-viral defense","HIV infections","HCV infections","mice","asymptomatic persistence","lymphocytic choromeningitis virus","hepatitis C virus","LCMV","lysing MCMV-infected antigen","humans","fatal pathology","progression","certain natural killer","established model","murine cytomegalovirus","reasons","immunopathology","rheostats","severe disease","correlation","contrast","three-way interaction","different outcomes","Recent genetic evidence","instance","immunoregulatory functions"],"language":"en"},

This study determined the burden of pediatric LRTIs on hospital settings in British Columbia and the benefits of prevention strategies as they relate to healthcare resource demand. METHODS: LRTI inpatient episodes for patients \u003C19 years of age during 2008\u20132010 were extracted from the BC Discharge Abstract Database. The annual number of acute care beds required to treat pediatric LRTIs was estimated. Sub-analyses determined the burden due to infants \u003C1 year of age and high-risk infants. Population projections were used to forecast LRTI hospitalizations and the effectiveness of public health initiatives to reduce the incidence of LRTIs to 2020 and 2030. RESULTS: During 2008\u20132010, LRTI as the primary diagnosis accounted for 32.0 and 75.9% hospitalizations for diseases of the respiratory system in children \u003C19 years of age and infants \u003C1 year of age, respectively. Infants \u003C1 year of age accounted for 47 and 77% hospitalizations due to pediatric LRTIs and pediatric LRTI hospitalizations specifically due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively. The average length of stay was 3.1 days for otherwise healthy infants \u003C1 year of age and 9.1 days for high-risk infants (P \u003C0.0001). 73.1% pediatric LRTI hospitalizations occurred between November and April. Over the study timeframe, 19.6 acute care beds were required on average to care for pediatric LRTIs which increased to 64.0 beds at the peak of LRTI hospitalizations. Increases in LRTI bed-days of 5.5 and 16.2% among \u003C19 year olds by 2020 and 2030, respectively, were predicted. Implementation of appropriate prevention strategies could cause 307 and 338 less LRTI hospitalizations in \u003C19 year olds in 2020 and 2030, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pediatric LRTI hospitalizations require significant use of acute care infrastructure particularly between November and April. Population projections show the burden may increase in the next 20 years, but implementation of effective public health prevention strategies may contribute to reducing the acute care demand and to supporting efforts for overall pediatric healthcare sustainability.","publish_time":"2012-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santibanez, Pablo; Gooch, Katherine; Vo, Pamela; Lorimer, Michelle; Sandino, Yurik","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/04c1c40f4464bc035e57d0ecf2f8a033e4e7f466.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3544629.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3544629/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcwMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LRTI","BC Discharge Abstract Database"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Pediatric LRTI hospitalizations","peak of LRTI hospitalizations","burden of pediatric LRTIs","year of age","LRTI bed-days","years of age","pediatric healthcare sustainability","LRTI inpatient episodes","high-risk infants","year olds","acute care demand","healthy infants","significant burden","incidence of LRTIs","annual number of acute care beds","significant use of acute care infrastructure","benefits of prevention strategies","Implementation of appropriate prevention strategies","implementation of effective public health prevention strategies","patients","healthcare systems","healthcare resource demand","Population projections","effectiveness of public health initiatives","respiratory system","study timeframe","respiratory syncytial virus","average length of stay","British Columbia","hospital settings","efforts","children","families","diseases","METHODS","CONCLUSION","BC Discharge Abstract Database","RSV","BACKGROUND","Sub-analyses","primary diagnosis","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

MZP is a highly potent antagonistic inhibitor of IMPDH that blocks the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes that use the de novo pathway of guanine nucleotide synthesis almost exclusively. In the present study, we investigated the ability of MZP to directly inhibit the human RNA capping enzyme (HCE), a protein harboring both RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase and RNA guanylyltransferase activities. HCE is involved in the synthesis of the cap structure found at the 5\u2032 end of eukaryotic mRNAs, which is critical for the splicing of the cap-proximal intron, the transport of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and for both the stability and translation of mRNAs. Our biochemical studies provide the first insight that MZP can inhibit the formation of the RNA cap structure catalyzed by HCE. In the presence of MZP, the RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity appears to be relatively unaffected while the RNA guanylyltransferase activity is inhibited, indicating that the RNA guanylyltransferase activity is the main target of MZP inhibition. Kinetic studies reveal that MZP is a non-competitive inhibitor that likely targets an allosteric site on HCE. Mizoribine also impairs mRNA capping in living cells, which could account for the global mechanism of action of this therapeutic agent. Together, our study clearly demonstrates that mizoribine monophosphate inhibits the human RNA guanylyltransferase in vitro and impair mRNA capping in cellulo.","publish_time":"2013-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Picard-Jean, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric; Bougie, Isabelle; Shuto, Satoshi; Bisaillon, Martin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0d73d877a6bcede67ac884d7e5ada5dd3eb810c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3547949.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3547949/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcwNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MZP","RNA","HCE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA guanylyltransferase activity","human RNA guanylyltransferase","RNA guanylyltransferase activities","RNA cap structure","ability of MZP","presence of MZP","HCE","human RNA capping enzyme","Mizoribine monophosphate","mRNA capping","main target of MZP inhibition","triphosphatase activity","specific inhibitor","non-competitive inhibitor","monophosphate dehydrogenase","transport of mRNAs","translation of mRNAs","novo pathway of guanine nucleotide synthesis","novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis","potent antagonistic inhibitor of IMPDH","cap-proximal intron","end of eukaryotic mRNAs","biochemical studies","Kinetic studies","present study","step","formation","B lymphocytes","proliferation of T","cellular inosine","splicing","insight","global mechanism of action","therapeutic agent","living cells","allosteric site","stability","cytoplasm","nucleus","rate","protein","cellulo"],"language":"en"},

The objective of this study was to determine frequency, risk factors, and outcome of ALI in patients with infectious pneumonia. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult patients with microbiologically positive pneumonia, hospitalized at two Mayo Clinic Rochester hospitals between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007. In a subsequent nested case-control analysis, we evaluated the differences in prehospital and intrahospital exposures between patients with and without ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) matched by specific pathogen, isolation site, gender, and closest age in a 1:1 manner. RESULTS: The study included 596 patients; 365 (61.2%) were men. The median age was 65 (IQR, 53 to 75) years. In total, 171 patients (28.7%) were diagnosed with ALI. The occurrence of ALI was less frequent in bacterial (n = 99 of 412, 24%) compared with viral (n = 19 of 55, 35%), fungal (n = 39 of 95, 41%), and mixed isolates pneumonias (n = 14 of 34, 41%; P = 0.002). After adjusting for baseline severity of illness and comorbidities, patients in whom ALI developed had a markedly increased risk of hospital death (OR(adj )9.7; 95% CI, 6.0 to 15.9). In a nested case-control study, presence of shock (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 2.8 to 45.9), inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.5), and transfusions (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.5 to 19.6) independently predicted ALI development. CONCLUSIONS: The development of ALI among patients hospitalized with infectious pneumonia varied among pulmonary pathogens and was associated with increased mortality.

Mutational pressure is commonly simplified to genomic GC content; however mononucleotide and dinucleotide frequencies in different genomes or mRNAs may vary significantly, especially in RNA viruses. A series of in silico shuffling algorithms were developed to account for these features and analyze the relative impact of mutational pressure components on codon usage bias in RNA viruses. Total GC content was a poor descriptor of viral genome composition and causes of codon usage bias. Genomic nucleotide content was the single most important factor of synonymous codon usage. Moreover, the choice between compatible amino acids (e.g., leucine and isoleucine) was strongly affected by genomic nucleotide composition. Dinucleotide composition at codon positions 2-3 had additional effect on codon usage. Together with mononucleotide composition bias, it could explain almost the entire codon usage bias in RNA viruses. On the other hand, strong dinucleotide content bias at codon position 3-1 found in some viruses had very little effect on codon usage. A hypothetical innate immunity sensor for CpG in RNA could partially explain the codon usage bias, but due to dependence of virus translation upon biased host translation machinery, experimental studies are required to further explore the source of dinucleotide bias in RNA viruses.","publish_time":"2013-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belalov, Ilya S.; Lukashev, Alexander N.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/053c632366f418a4f5cee0187d261666c4d99068.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3581513.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3581513/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzczNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dinucleotide"],"organizations":["RNA","GC","CpG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["entire codon usage bias","codon positions","dinucleotide composition","RNA viruses","mononucleotide composition bias","source of dinucleotide bias","strong dinucleotide content bias","important factor of synonymous codon usage","genomic nucleotide composition","Genomic nucleotide content","dinucleotide frequencies","genomic GC content","translational pressure","Total GC content","relative impact of mutational pressure components","poor descriptor of viral genome composition","Choice of synonymous codons","additional effect","little effect","dependence of virus translation","relative abundance of tRNAs","biased host translation machinery","experimental studies","CpG","cell","different genomes","hypothetical innate immunity sensor","compatible amino acids","silico shuffling algorithms","account","mRNAs","hand","series","features","isoleucine"],"language":"en"},

Thus PanAd3 is a promising candidate vector for vaccines, including universal influenza vaccines.","publish_time":"2013-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vitelli, Alessandra; Quirion, Mary R.; Lo, Chia-Yun; Misplon, Julia A.; Grabowska, Agnieszka K.; Pierantoni, Angiolo; Ammendola, Virginia; Price, Graeme E.; Soboleski, Mark R.; Cortese, Riccardo; Colloca, Stefano; Nicosia, Alfredo; Epstein, Suzanne L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/532e417a66dbe4822a3f8f9b496c105ccc7dd412.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3594242.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3594242/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pan Adenovirus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["vaccine vector","T cell responses","universal influenza vaccines","replication defective PanAd3","single intranasal administration of PanAd3","NPM1 vaccine","strong antibody","high dose lethal influenza virus challenge","challenge infection","Pan paniscus","potent transgene immunogenicity","fusion protein of conserved influenza antigens nucleoprotein","promising candidate vector","Pan Adenovirus type","minimal pre-existing immunity","protection","matrix","human population","bonobos","mouse model","best profiles","adenoviruses","chimpanzees","study"],"language":"en"},

Public health authorities are hesitant in introducing social distancing interventions due to societal disruption and productivity losses. This study estimates the effectiveness and total cost (from a societal perspective, with a lifespan time horizon) of a comprehensive range of social distancing and antiviral drug strategies, under a range of pandemic severity categories. METHODS: An economic analysis was conducted using a simulation model of a community of ~30,000 in Australia. Data from the 2009 pandemic was used to derive relationships between the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and hospitalization rates for each of five pandemic severity categories, with CFR ranging from 0.1% to 2.5%. RESULTS: For a pandemic with basic reproduction number R(0) = 1.8, adopting no interventions resulted in total costs ranging from $441 per person for a pandemic at category 1 (CFR 0.1%) to $8,550 per person at category 5 (CFR 2.5%). For severe pandemics of category 3 (CFR 0.75%) and greater, a strategy combining antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, extended school closure and community contact reduction resulted in the lowest total cost of any strategy, costing $1,584 per person at category 5. This strategy was highly effective, reducing the attack rate to 5%. With low severity pandemics costs are dominated by productivity losses due to illness and social distancing interventions, whereas higher severity pandemic costs are dominated by healthcare costs and costs arising from productivity losses due to death. CONCLUSIONS: For pandemics in high severity categories the strategies with the lowest total cost to society involve rigorous, sustained social distancing, which are considered unacceptable for low severity pandemics due to societal disruption and cost.","publish_time":"2013-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kelso, Joel K; Halder, Nilimesh; Postma, Maarten J; Milne, George J","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/52d994a20f5f2747dedcd2c25763b3341f663326.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3606600.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3606600/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Case Fatality Rate"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["CFR","total costs","higher severity pandemic costs","range of pandemic severity categories","low severity pandemics costs","social distancing interventions","lowest total cost","high severity categories","healthcare costs","productivity losses","severe pandemics of category","strategy","person","comprehensive range of social distancing","societal disruption","societal perspective","H5N1","antiviral drug strategies","antiviral treatment","attack rate","recent results","community contact reduction","human transmissible strain","Case Fatality Rate","extended school closure","prophylaxis","society","lifespan time horizon","pathogenic influenza","hospitalization rates","illness","basic reproduction number R","Public health authorities","relationships","economic analysis","simulation model","threat of emergence","study","effectiveness","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","death","Australia","Data","ferrets"],"language":"en"},

RNA and DNA libraries were sequenced from plasma filtrates enriched in viral particles to catalog virus populations. Hepatitis viruses were readily detected at high coverage in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C, but only a limited number of sequences resembling other viruses were found. The exception was a library from a patient diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection that contained multiple sequences matching GB virus C (GBV-C). Abundant GBV-C reads were also found in plasma from patients with AIH, whereas Torque teno virus (TTV) was found at high frequency in samples from patients with AIH and NASH. After taxonomic classification of sequences by BLASTn, a substantial fraction in each library, ranging from 35% to 76%, remained unclassified. These unknown sequences were assembled into scaffolds along with virus, phage and endogenous retrovirus sequences and then analyzed by BLASTx against the non-redundant protein database. Nearly the full genome of a heretofore-unknown circovirus was assembled and many scaffolds that encoded proteins with similarity to plant, insect and mammalian viruses. The presence of this novel circovirus was confirmed by PCR. BLASTx also identified many polypeptides resembling nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) proteins. We re-evaluated these alignments with a profile hidden Markov method, HHblits, and observed inconsistencies in the target proteins reported by the different algorithms. This suggests that sequence alignments are insufficient to identify NCLDV proteins, especially when these alignments are only to small portions of the target protein. Nevertheless, we have now established a reliable protocol for the identification of viruses in plasma that can also be adapted to other patient samples such as urine, bile, saliva and other body fluids.","publish_time":"2013-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Law, John; Jovel, Juan; Patterson, Jordan; Ford, Glenn; O\u2019keefe, Sandra; Wang, Weiwei; Meng, Bo; Song, Deyong; Zhang, Yong; Tian, Zhijian; Wasilenko, Shawn T.; Rahbari, Mandana; Mitchell, Troy; Jordan, Tracy; Carpenter, Eric; Mason, Andrew L.; Wong, Gane Ka-Shu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2e905d86f4b7a8cb748864eb560c6555816fb0f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3629200.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3629200/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Markov"],"organizations":["AIH","NASH","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hepatitis C virus","Hepatitis viruses","chronic hepatitis C","patients","GB virus C","chronic hepatitis B","autoimmune hepatitis","unknown sequences","chronic viral hepatitis B","AIH","multiple sequences","NCLDV proteins","virus populations","mammalian viruses","target proteins","identification of viruses","Abundant GBV-C reads","plasma filtrates","Torque teno virus","endogenous retrovirus sequences","limited number of sequences","taxonomic classification of sequences","nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses","BLASTx","patient samples","NASH","scaffolds","sequence alignments","unknown circovirus","library","viral particles","high coverage","DNA libraries","high frequency","novel circovirus","non-redundant protein database","infection","bile","HCV","profile hidden Markov method","HHblits","polypeptides","BLASTn","similarity","TTV","plant","insect","phage","non-alcoholic steatohepatitis","unbiased metagenomics survey","saliva","urine","inconsistencies","substantial fraction","small portions","liver disease","body fluids","reliable protocol","control","different algorithms","presence","PCR","RNA","genome","exception"],"language":"en"},

Overactivation of brain Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) - Angiotensin II (Ang II) - Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) axis was found to be involved in the progress of hypertension, atherosclerosis and thrombogenesis, which increased the susceptibility to ischemic stroke. Besides, brain Ang II levels have been revealed to be increased in ischemic tissues after stroke, and contribute to neural damage through elevating oxidative stress levels and inducing inflammatory response in the ischemic hemisphere via AT(1)R. In recent years, new components of RAS have been discovered, including ACE2, Angiotensin-(1\u20137) [Ang-(1-7)] and Mas, which constitute ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. ACE2 converts Ang II to Ang-(1-7), and Ang-(1-7) binds with its receptor Mas, exerting benefical effects in cerebrovascular disease. Through interacting with nitric oxide and bradykinin, Ang-(1-7) could attenuate the development of hypertension and the pathologic progress of atherosclerosis. Besides, its antithrombotic activity also prevents thrombogenic events, which may contribute to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. In addition, after ischemia insult, ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas has been shown to reduce the cerebral infarct size and improve neurological deficits through its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Taken together, activation of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis may become a novel therapeutic target in prevention and treatment of ischemia stroke, which deserves further investigations.","publish_time":"2013-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiang, Teng; Gao, Li; Lu, Jie; Zhang, Ying-Dong","journal":"Curr Neuropharmacol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fe01cb9f2b36418bd0f5a17bc665e2e02fd2460.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3637674.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3637674/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Ang II"],"organizations":["RAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE2-Ang","Mas axis","risk of ischemic stroke","receptor Mas","Overactivation of brain Angiotensin","ischemic hemisphere","ischemic tissues","treatment of ischemia stroke","renin-angiotensin system","progress of hypertension","diseases of cerebrovascular system","pathologic progress of atherosclerosis","cerebrovascular disease","anti-inflammatory effects","ischemia insult","development of hypertension","exerting benefical effects","new components of RAS","elevating oxidative stress levels","neurological deficits","physiological homeostasis","inflammatory response","neural damage","prevention","novel therapeutic target","crucial regulator","enzyme","cerebral infarct size","recent years","antioxidative","nitric oxide","bradykinin","thrombogenesis","antithrombotic activity","thrombogenic events","interacting","addition","susceptibility","type","investigations"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (mean age 36.3 years) with ARDS receiving ECMO for refractory hypoxemia were studied. Eighteen (86%) patients were retrieved from external intensive care units (ICUs) by a dedicated ECMO retrieval team. Eleven (55%) had H1N1 influenza A-associated pneumonitis. Eighteen (86%) patients survived to hospital discharge. Of the 18 survivors, ten (56%) were discharged to other hospitals and 8 (44%) were discharged directly home. Sequelae and health related quality of life were evaluated for 15 of the 18 (71%) long-term survivors (assessment at median 8 months). Mean SF-36 scores were significantly lower across all domains compared to age and sex matched Australian norms. Mean SF-36 scores were lower (minimum important difference at least 5 points) than previously described ARDS survivors in the domains of general health, mental health, vitality and social function. One patient had long-term disability as a result of ICU acquired weakness. Only 26% of survivors had returned to previous work levels at the time of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This ARDS cohort had a high survival rate (86%) after use of ECMO support for reversible refractory hypoxemia. Long term survivors had similar physical health but decreased mental health, general health, vitality and social function compared to other ARDS survivors and an unexpectedly poor return to work.","publish_time":"2012-10-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hodgson, Carol L; Hayes, Kate; Everard, Tori; Nichol, Alistair; Davies, Andrew R; Bailey, Michael J; Tuxen, David V; Cooper, David J; Pellegrino, Vin","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f26e117ddb8311a5a717ea67aead4a05dc4ceae9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3682304.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682304/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO","ARDS","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ARDS patients","mental health","long-term survivors","prospective health related quality of life","described ARDS survivors","domains of general health","long-term quality of life assessment","EuroQol health related quality of life questionnaire","ARDS cohort","similar physical health","Long term survivors","reversible refractory hypoxemia","ECMO support","Mean SF","mean age","vitality","scores","social function","dedicated ECMO retrieval team","long-term disability","long term outcome","Australian norms","retrospective observational study","previous work levels","high survival rate","tertiary Australian centre","ICUs","acute respiratory distress syndrome","points","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","HRQoL","rescue therapy","external intensive care units","minimum important difference","years","result of ICU","sex","median","poor return","EQ5D","Sequelae","time of follow-up","Short-Form","international data","research groups","H1N1 influenza","associated pneumonitis","METHODS","months","RESULTS","weakness","INTRODUCTION","purpose","hospital discharge","CONCLUSIONS","hospitals"],"language":"en"},

It is now used in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapies, including imatinib. Here we report a novel effect of dasatinib on inducing the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells through MEK/ERK-dependent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). We found that dasatinib could induce the differentiation of AML cells as demonstrated by the expression of differentiation marker CD11b, G0/G1 phase arrest and decreased ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm. Of note, dasatinib induced robust phosphorylation of STAT1 both at Tyr701 and Ser727 as well as the redistribution of STAT1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thus leading to the transcription of STAT1-targeted genes. Knocking down STAT1 expression by shRNA significantly attenuated dasatinib-induced differentiation, indicating an important role of STAT1 in myeloid maturation. We further found that dasatinib-induced activation of STAT1 was regulated by the MEK/ERK kinases. The phosporylation of MEK and ERK occurred rapidly upon dasatinib treatment and increased progressively as differentiation was induced. MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0216 not only inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1, but also abrogated dasatinib-induced myeloid differentiation, suggesting that MEK/ERK dependent phosphorylation of STAT1 might be indispensable for the differentiating effect of dasatinib in AML cells. Taken together, our study suggests that STAT1 is an important mediator in dasatinib-induced differentiation of AML cells, whose activation requires the activation of MEK/ERK cascades.","publish_time":"2013-06-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fang, Yanfen; Zhong, Like; Lin, Meihua; Zhou, Xinglu; Jing, Hui; Ying, Meidan; Luo, Peihua; Yang, Bo; He, Qiaojun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f3e18a9a954832a2335fa3c26c42f127a79855c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3692534.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3692534/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Dasatinib"],"organizations":["BCR/ABL","MEK/ERK","MEK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dasatinib-induced activation of STAT1","dasatinib-induced differentiation of AML cells","STAT1 expression","attenuated dasatinib-induced differentiation","transcription of STAT1","dasatinib treatment","redistribution of STAT1","myeloid differentiation","activation of MEK","ERK dependent phosphorylation of STAT1","robust phosphorylation of STAT1","important role of STAT1","differentiating effect of dasatinib","novel effect of dasatinib","phosporylation of MEK","ERK kinases","differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia","ERK cascades","expression of differentiation marker CD11b","MEK inhibitors PD98059","ERK-dependent activation of signal transducer","myeloid maturation","cytoplasm","important mediator","activator of transcription","treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia","Src kinases","decreased ratio of nucleus","G0","G1 phase arrest","ABL","resistance","CML","multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR","shRNA","intolerance","prior therapies","FDA","U0216","Tyr701","imatinib","Ser727","targeted genes","note","BMS","study"],"language":"en"},

The SIMOP procedure combines an individual-based model and the Nelder-Mead simplex optimization method. The method is used to forecast epidemics simulated over synthetic social networks representing Montgomery County in Virginia, Miami, Seattle and surrounding metropolitan regions. The results are presented for the first four weeks. Depending on the synthetic network, the peak time could be predicted within a 95% CI as early as seven weeks before the actual peak. The peak infected and total infected were also accurately forecasted for Montgomery County in Virginia within the forecasting period.

Cambodia in particular has the potential for high rates of avoidable deaths from pandemic influenza due to large gaps in health system resources. This study seeks to better understand the course and cost-of-illness for cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Cambodia. METHODS: We studied the 18 laboratory-confirmed cases of avian influenza subtype H5N1 identified in Cambodia between January 2005 and August 2011. Medical records for all patients were reviewed to extract information on patient characteristics, travel to hospital, time to admission, diagnostic testing, treatment and disease outcomes. Further data related to costs was collected through interviews with key informants at district and provincial hospitals, the Ministry of Health and non-governmental organisations. An ingredient-based approach was used to estimate the total economic cost for each study patient. Costing was conducted from a societal perspective and included both financial and opportunity costs to the patient or carer. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to evaluate potential change or variation in the cost-of-illness. RESULTS: Of the 18 patients studied, 11 (61%) were under the age of 18 years. The majority of patients (16, 89%) died, eight (44%) within 24 hours of hospital admission. There was an average delay of seven days between symptom onset and hospitalisation with patients travelling an average of 148 kilometres (8-476 km) to the admitting hospital. Five patients were treated with oseltamivir of whom two received the recommended dose. For the 16 patients who received all their treatment in Cambodia the average per patient cost of H5N1 influenza illness was US$300 of which 85.0% comprised direct medical provider costs, including diagnostic testing (41.2%), pharmaceuticals (28.4%), hospitalisation (10.4%), oxygen (4.4%) and outpatient consultations (0.6%). Patient or family costs were US$45 per patient (15.0%) of total economic cost. CONCLUSION: Cases of avian influenza in Cambodia were characterised by delays in hospitalisation, deficiencies in some aspects of treatment and a high fatality rate. The costs associated with medical care, particularly diagnostic testing and pharmaceutical therapy, were major contributors to the relatively high cost-of-illness.","publish_time":"2013-06-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Humphries-Waa, Karen; Drake, Tom; Huszar, Anthony; Liverani, Marco; Borin, Khieu; Touch, Sok; Srey, Teng; Coker, Richard","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9ed67c6f9ce231b639043089e9609300bee48951.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3700884.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3700884/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southeast Asia","Cambodia"],"keyphrases":["Cambodia","patient cost of H5N1 influenza illness","high cost","pandemic influenza","pathogenic influenza","study patient","pathogenic avian influenza","patient characteristics","majority of patients","total economic cost","diagnostic testing","cases of avian influenza subtype H5N1","opportunity costs","hospitalisation","family costs","direct medical provider costs","potential change","aspects of treatment","average delay","medical care","Medical records","hours of hospital admission","admitting hospital","high fatality rate","pandemic capacity","Ministry of Health","high rates of avoidable deaths","potential epicentre of emerging diseases","health system resources","large gaps","district","provincial hospitals","travel","time","key informants","pharmaceutical therapy","symptom onset","major contributors","days","non-governmental organisations","interviews","deficiencies","information","disease outcomes","laboratory","delays","societal perspective","variation","carer","course","CONCLUSION","Southeast Asia","Sensitivity analysis","ingredient-based approach","BACKGROUND","Costing","oxygen","oseltamivir","pharmaceuticals","kilometres","outpatient consultations","recommended dose","years","METHODS","data","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks between November 2009 and November 2011. METHODS: Data were gathered during 149 outbreaks of norovirus in hospital wards from five hospitals in two major cities in England serving a population of two million. We used the time between the first two cases of each outbreak to estimate the serial interval for norovirus in this setting. This distribution and dates of illness onset were used to calculate epidemic trees for each outbreak. We then used a permutation test to assess whether proximity, for all outbreaks, was more extreme than would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis that proximity was not associated with transmission risk. RESULTS: 65 outbreaks contained complete data on both onset dates and ward position. We estimated the serial interval to be 1.86 days (95% CI 1.6 to 2.2 days), and with this value found strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis that proximity was not significant (p\u003C0.001). Sensitivity analysis using different values of the serial interval showed that there was evidence to reject the null hypothesis provided the assumed serial interval was less than 2.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that patients occupying the same bay as patients with symptomatic norovirus infection are at an increased risk of becoming infected by these patients compared with patients elsewhere in the same ward.","publish_time":"2013-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Harris, John P; Lopman, Ben A; Cooper, Ben S; O\u0027Brien, Sarah J","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e33bf088cfbcde318f35f3be8dea6810b0b96ce.json; document_parses/pdf_json/efcd4f058d2b435a17c63793904cbf85c899b982.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3710976.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3710976/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["England"],"keyphrases":["outbreaks of norovirus","patients","spread of norovirus","null hypothesis","Enhanced surveillance of norovirus outbreaks","assumed serial interval","days","symptomatic norovirus infection","onset dates","hospitals","strong evidence","role of spatial proximity","RESULTS","dates of illness onset","complete data","increased risk","transmission risk","ward position","different values","major cities","hospital wards","England","DESIGN","chance","bays","Sensitivity analysis","epidemic trees","population","distribution","setting","cases","permutation test","CONCLUSIONS","time","OBJECTIVE","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Currently, no licensed vaccine against RSV is available. Here we describe the development of a safe and effective intranasal subunit vaccine that is based on recombinant fusion (F) protein bound to the surface of immunostimulatory bacterium-like particles (BLPs) derived from the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis. Different variants of F were analyzed with respect to their conformation and reactivity with neutralizing antibodies, assuming that F proteins mimicking the metastable prefusion form of RSV F expose a more extensive and relevant epitope repertoire than F proteins corresponding to the postfusion structure. Our results indicate that the recombinant soluble ectodomain of RSV F readily adopts a postfusion conformation, generation of which cannot be prevented by C-terminal addition of a trimerization motif, but whose formation is prevented by mutation of the two furin cleavage sites in F. While the putative postfusion form of F is recognized well by the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab, this is much less so for the more potently neutralizing, prefusion-specific antibodies D25 and AM22. Both addition of the trimerization motif and mutation of the furin cleavage sites increased the reactivity of F with D25 and AM22, with the highest reactivity being observed for F proteins in which both these features were combined. Intranasal vaccination of mice or cotton rats with BLPs loaded with this latter prefusion-like F protein (BLP-F), resulted in the potent induction of F-specific immunoglobulins and in significantly decreased virus titers in the lungs upon RSV challenge. Moreover, and in contrast to animals vaccinated with formalin-inactivated RSV, animals that received BLP-F exhibited high levels of F-specific secretory IgA in the nose and RSV-neutralizing antibodies in sera, but did not show symptoms of enhanced disease after challenge with RSV.","publish_time":"2013-08-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rigter, Alan; Widjaja, Ivy; Versantvoort, Hanneke; Coenjaerts, Frank E.

Neurotropic demyelinating strain of MHV (MHV-A59 or its isogenic recombinant strain RSA59) induces MS-like disease in mice mediated by microglia, along with a small population of T cells. The mechanism of demyelination is at least in part due to microglia-mediated myelin stripping, with some direct axonal injury. Immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mainly CD4(\u002B) T-cell-mediated disease, although CD8(\u002B) T cells may play a significant role in demyelination. It is possible that both autoimmune and nonimmune mechanisms such as direct viral toxicity may induce MS. Our study directly compares CNS pathology in autoimmune and viral-induced MS models. Mice with viral-induced and EAE demyelinating diseases demonstrated similar patterns and distributions of demyelination that accumulated over the course of the disease. However, significant differences in acute inflammation were noted. Inflammation was restricted mainly to white matter at all times in EAE, whereas inflammation initially largely involved gray matter in acute MHV-induced disease and then is subsequently localized only in white matter in the chronic disease phase. The presence of dual mechanisms of demyelination may be responsible for the failure of immunosuppression to promote long-term remission in many MS patients.","publish_time":"2013-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kishore, Abhinoy; Kanaujia, Anurag; Nag, Soma; Rostami, A.

We found that rapamycin, at nM concentrations, increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2\u03B1 in rapamycin-sensitive and estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells, but had only a minimal effect on eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation in the rapamycin-insensitive triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Addition of salubrinal \u2013 an inhibitor of eIF2\u03B1 dephosphorylation \u2013 decreased expression of a surface marker associated with capacity for self renewal, increased senescence and induced clonogenic cell death, suggesting that excessive phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1 is detrimental to the cells\u0027 survival. Treating cells with salubrinal enhanced radiation-induced increase in eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation and clonogenic death and showed that irradiated cells are more sensitive to increased eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation than non-irradiated ones. Similar to salubrinal - the phosphomimetic eIF2\u03B1 variant - S51D - increased sensitivity to radiation, and both abrogated radiation-induced increase in breast cancer type 1 susceptibility gene, thus implicating enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1 in modulation of DNA repair. Indeed, salubrinal inhibited non-homologous end joining as well as homologous recombination repair of double strand breaks that were induced by I-SceI in green fluorescent protein reporter plasmids. In addition to its effect on radiation, salubrinal enhanced eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation and clonogenic death in response to the histone deacetylase inhibitor \u2013 vorinostat. Finally, the catalytic competitive inhibitor of mTOR - Ku-0063794 - increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1 demonstrating further the involvement of mTOR activity in modulating eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation. These experiments suggest that excessive phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1 decreases survival of cancer cells; making eIF2\u03B1 a worthy target for drug development, with the potential to enhance the cytotoxic effects of established anti-neoplastic therapies and circumvent resistance to rapalogues and possibly to other drugs that inhibit upstream components of the mTOR pathway.","publish_time":"2013-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuval-Kochen, Liron; Paglin, Shoshana; Keshet, Gilmor; Lerenthal, Yaniv; Nakar, Charles; Golani, Tamar; Toren, Amos; Yahalom, Joachim; Pfeffer, Raphael; Lawrence, Yaacov","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bda64532f4a16e2885868385170f8bc89ab8f789.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3808413.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3808413/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozk0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["increased eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","increased phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1","enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1","excessive phosphorylation of eIF2\u03B1","modulating eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","salubrinal enhanced eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation","inhibitor of eIF2\u03B1 dephosphorylation","mTOR inhibitor","irradiated cells","phosphomimetic eIF2\u03B1 variant - S51D","response of cancer cells","survival of cancer cells","increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor","salubrinal enhanced radiation-induced increase","rapamycin-sensitive","Addition of salubrinal","increased senescence","clonogenic death","increased sensitivity","novel rapamycin","induced clonogenic cell death","abrogated radiation-induced increase","catalytic competitive inhibitor of mTOR","mTOR pathway","histone deacetylase inhibitor","involvement of mTOR activity","resistance","breast cancer type","rapamycin-insensitive triple-negative MDA-MB","non-homologous end","non-irradiated ones","minimal effect","cells\u0027 survival","homologous recombination repair of double strand breaks","modulation of DNA repair","self renewal","cytotoxic effects of established anti-neoplastic therapies","susceptibility gene","surface marker","capacity","decreased expression","Ku","worthy target","nM concentrations","SceI","green fluorescent protein reporter plasmids","drug development","estrogen-dependent MCF","key players","potential","rapalogues","upstream components","targets","drugs","vorinostat","experiments","effort"],"language":"en"},

Disturbances were characterized by granular blood flow, sinusoidal microthrombi, distortion of sinusoids by edematous hepatocytes and necrotic lesions. Following the acute infection, Day 10, two patterns of chronic disease were observed. Eighty percent of the mice developed chronic granulomatous hepatitis whereas in the remaining 20% a more severe chronic aggressive hepatitis was observed which was characterized by ongoing hepatocellular necrosis and a marked mononuclear cell infiltrate. In both cases, in vivo microcirculatory abnormalities were found predominantly around visible lesions. Onset of the microcirculatory abnormalities was found to be concomitant with a rise in monocyte related procoagulant activity. Procoagulant activity rose acutely and remained elevated throughout the chronic phase but was higher in animals with severe disease. In contrast to the above, normal blood flow and histology were seen in the resistant A/J mice at all times following infection, and procoagulant activity remained at basal levels despite active viral replication as demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies and recovery of infectious virus. These observations suggest a role for monocyte procoagulant activity in the development of microcirculatory abnormalities following mouse hepatitis virus type 3 infection which may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease.","publish_time":"2005-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Macphee, Peggy J.; Dindzans, Vincent J.; Fung, Lai\u2010Sum; Levy, Gary A.","journal":"Hepatology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f76200f5f1f1b67cc66dcff0343f36818a9c2857.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165583/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["abnormalities of microcirculatory flow","chronic granulomatous hepatitis","monocyte procoagulant activity","development of microcirculatory abnormalities","severe chronic aggressive hepatitis","chronic phase","FeJ mice","patterns of chronic disease","acute infection","chronic effects of mouse hepatitis virus type","monocyte related procoagulant activity","severe disease","granular blood flow","normal blood flow","recovery of infectious virus","semisusceptible C3HeB","necrotic lesions","visible lesions","distortion of sinusoids","immunofluorescence studies","sinusoidal microthrombi","active viral replication","basal levels","edematous hepatocytes","marked mononuclear cell infiltrate","ongoing hepatocellular necrosis","microcirculation","animals","rise","times","liver","histology","role","Day","localized avascular foci","Disturbances","observations","percent","contrast","pathogenesis","cases","Onset"],"language":"en"},

Major mucosal effector immune mechanisms include secretory antibodies, largely of immunoglobulin A (IgA) isotype, cytotoxic T cells, as well as cytokines, chemokines and their receptors. Immunologic unresponsiveness (tolerance) is a key feature of the mucosal immune system, and deliberate vaccination or natural immunization by a mucosal route can effectively induce immune suppression. The diverse compartments located in the aerodigestive and genitourinary tracts and exocrine glands communicate via preferential homing of lymphocytes and antigen\u2010presenting cells. Mucosal administration of antigens may result in the concomitant expression of secretory immunoglobulin A (S\u2010IgA) antibody responses in various mucosal tissues and secretions, and under certain conditions, in the suppression of immune responses. Thus, developing formulations based on efficient delivery of selected anti\u2010gens/tolerogens, cytokines and adjuvants may impact on the design of future vaccines and of specific immunotherapeutic approaches against diseases associated with untoward immune responses, such as autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, and tissue\u2010damaging inflammatory reactions triggered by persistent microorganisms.","publish_time":"2006-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Czerkinsky, Cecil; Anjueie, Fabienne; McGhee, Jerry R.; Geoige\u2010Chundy, Annie; Holmgren, Jon; Kieny, Marie\u2010Paule; Fujiyashi, Kohlaro; Mestecky, Jiri F.; Pierrefite\u2010Carle, Val\u00E9rie; Rusk, Carok; Sun, Jia\u2010Bin","journal":"Immunol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/83857755a980a9e03e17a3c65f233231c1d4ef68.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165636/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsxOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune suppression","mucosal immune system of mammals","suppression of immune responses","mucosal route","untoward immune responses","Major mucosal effector immune mechanisms","various mucosal tissues","Mucosal administration of antigens","IgA","antibody responses","cytokines","cytotoxic T cells","secretory antibodies","concomitant expression of secretory immunoglobulin","inflammatory reactions","allergic reactions","host defense","integrated network of lymphoid cells","innate host factors","exocrine glands","specific immunotherapeutic approaches","deliberate vaccination","aerodigestive","secretions","diseases","autoimmune disorders","efficient delivery of selected anti\u2010gens","natural immunization","preferential homing of lymphocytes","key feature","genitourinary tracts","concert","isotype","design of future vaccines","tolerance","certain conditions","formulations","persistent microorganisms","adjuvants","Summary","Immunologic unresponsiveness","diverse compartments","chemokines"],"language":"en"},

The morphology of the venom apparatus intima in representatives of 38 genera of the problematic braconid wasp subfamily Rogadinae and other cyclostome braconids was investigated and a preliminary phylogenetic analysis for the group was performed with the information obtained. Despite the limited number of characters, the data suggest several relationships at various taxonomic levels. The venom apparatus in the Clinocentrini and the Stiropiini is relatively unmodified and similar to that found in other genera previously placed within a broader concept of the Rogadinae (e.g. genera of Lysitermini, Pentatermini, Tetratermini, Hormiini) and also to that of the Betylobraconinae. The presence of a cone of filaments located inside the secondary venom duct near to its insertion on the venom reservoir/primary venom duct is proposed as a synapomorphy for the tribe Rogadini to the exclusion of Stiropiini, Clinocentrini and Yeliconini. Other features of the secondary venom duct and its insertion on the venom reservoir/primary venom duct support a number of relationships between the genera of the Rogadini and also within the large genus Aleiodes. A clade containing 15 Rogadini genera (Bathoteca, Bathotecoides, Bulborogas, Canalirogas, Colastomion, Conspinaria, Cystomastacoides, Macrostomion, Megarhogas, Myocron, Pholichora, Rectivena, Rogas, Spinaria and Triraphis) is supported by the presence of a thickened and short secondary venom duct, whereas the different members of Aleiodes (excluding members of the subgenus Heterogamus) and Cordylorhogas are distinguished by having a recessed secondary venom duct with well\u2010defined and numerous internal filaments. New World Rogas species exhibit a unique venom apparatus and may not be closely related to the Old World ones. Features of the venom apparatus of the enigmatic genus Telengaia and the exothecine genera Shawiana and Colastes suggest that the Telengainae and Exothecinae are both closely related to the Braconinae, Gnamptodontinae, and possibly to the Opiinae and Alysiinae. An unsculptured venom reservoir was found in one specimen of the type species of Avga, A. choaspes, which is consistent with it occupying either a very basal position within the cyclostome braconids or belonging to a recently recognized \u2018Gondwanan\u2019 clade that also includes the Aphidiinae.","publish_time":"2004-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zaldivar\u2010River\u00F3n, A.; Areekul, B.; Shaw, M.

Is is obvious that some small groups, such as the small African antelope and the duikers, need highly specialised care and there is a great deal of work still to be done on their husbandry. The mountain or alpine species have been fairly successful with the goats showing the greatest adaptability. We feel there are grounds for optimism for the future of such animals as the Rocky mountain goat, the Japanese serow and even the Blue sheep. Of those species whose captive future is still in doubt, particularly those which are threatened in the wild, our researches indicate that concentrated efforts should be made to obtain sufficient founder stock to establish self\u2010sustaining populations as a hedge against total disaster in the wild. We felt that the evidence was strong that any of the ungulate species reviewed could be successfully maintained in captivity given the right circumstances. Basically, the husbandry procedures of all the reporting zoos were similar, although, of course, each zoo had its own variations. In some cases these measurably affected the success of the animal population. In the last 20 to 25 years inter\u2010zoo co\u2010operation and sharing of information has greatly expanded. Nevertheless we would now urge that even more emphasis should be put on the exchange of information to provide each zoo with up\u2010 to\u2010date data which would ensure that all zoos are kept abreast with the \u0027state of the art. With such a spirit of co\u2010operation the prospect of managing species as total captive populations appears to be practical and promising.","publish_time":"2007-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"THOMAS, WARREN D.; BARNES, ROBERT; CROTTY, MICHAEL; JONES, MARVIN","journal":"Int Zoo Yearb","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1d6f0d19a0c160acf05cc393d9ec3d1d36f8c65.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165825/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["total captive populations","captive future","alpine species","ungulate species","self\u2010sustaining populations","animals general","years inter\u2010zoo co\u2010operation","total disaster","small groups","reporting zoos","spirit of co\u2010operation","exchange of information","husbandry procedures","sufficient numbers of founders","Rocky mountain goat","sufficient founder stock","small African antelope","Japanese serow","preventative medicine","duikers","attention","specific needs","hedge","prospect","specialised care","success","goats","great deal of work","Blue sheep","researches","concentrated efforts","optimism","greatest adaptability","captivity","right circumstances","animal population","survey","grounds","date data","doubt","situation","cases","evidence","emphasis","variations","state"],"language":"en"},

Serum TNF\u2010\u03B1 levels were found to be elevated in all chronic hepatitis C patients including those cases presenting sustained biochemical remission of the disease after interferon therapy. Untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C showed increased TNF\u2010\u03B1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the liver and mononuclear cells as compared with healthy controls. After completion of treatment with interferon, patients experiencing sustained complete response showed values of TNF\u2010\u03B1 mRNA, both in the liver and in peripheral mononuclear cells, within the normal range, significantly lower than patients who did not respond to interferon and than those with complete response who relapsed after interferon withdrawal.

Viral vector based vaccines offer new avenues for the development of vaccines for effective disease control in poultry. Techniques developed for the construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses have been readily adapted to the construction of recombinant viruses based on fowlpox virus (rFPV). The ability to insert several genes into the large genome of fowlpox may enable the development of multivalent vaccines and vaccines incorporating immune response modifiers such as lymphokines. Newcastle disease, avian influenza, infectious bursal disease and Marek\u0027s disease antigens expressed by rFPV have been shown to be effective vaccines in poultry. None appear, however, to provide a substantial improvement in vaccine efficacy. Recombinant FPV will be a valuable adjunct to conventional vaccines currently in widespread use. Whether rFPV or other vector based vaccines can circumvent the problems of vaccination in the presence of high maternally derived antibodies is yet to be resolved. The observation that avipoxvirus recombinants may be suitable for the vaccination of non\u2010avian species provides an added dimension to vaccines based on FPV or other avipoxviruses.

We have characterized an animal tumor model that has 3 properties essential for the study of metastasis of colon carcinoma cells: epithelial cell origin; a reproducible pattern of metastatic behavior and the ability to be propagated both in vitro and in vivo to facilitate identification of biochemical correlates of metastasis. The KI2/TR cell line was derived from a transplantable colon carcinoma induced by dimethylhydrazine in the BD\u2010IX rat strain. Transmission electron microscopy of KI2/TR cells demonstrated junctional complexes, desmosomes and surface microvilli characteristic of gastrointestinal epithelial cells. The epithelial cell origin of KI2/TR was confirmed by demonstrating the presence of keratin, a marker of epithelial cells, but not vimentin, a constituent of mesenchymal cells. Secretion of CEA and Ca19\u20109 antigens by KI2/TR cells in vitro was below the sensitivity of the assays (1 ng/ml and 6 U/ml respectively). KI2/TR cells produced tumors following s.c. injection into syngeneic BD\u2010IX rats, allogeneic RNU/rnuDF rats and xenogeneic CRL:nu/nuBR mice. Macroscopic lung metastases were observed in animals from all 3 groups. Distal lymph node metastases were more frequent in BD\u2010IX rats than in nude rats or mice. The histological appearances of all tumors and metastases were similar, showing a moderate to poorly differentiated glandular carcinoma. Intrasplenic injections of KI2/TR cells in nude mice resulted in liver colonization. Preferential growth of tumor cells at sites of trauma was also observed. The results show that the KI2/TR system can be used as a model to study metastasis of colon carcinoma cells and may find utility in the testing of chemotherapeutic agents against metastatic lesions.","publish_time":"2006-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dunnington, Damien J.; Buscarino, Charles; Gennaro, Doris; Greig, Russell; Poste, George","journal":"Int J Cancer","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/51f7b4fa7d0feed1231abfb9c4df31edb3516563.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165865/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TR cells","marker of epithelial cells","study metastasis of colon carcinoma cells","constituent of mesenchymal cells","epithelial cell origin of KI2","TR system","Preferential growth of tumor cells","TR cell line","transplantable colon carcinoma","surface microvilli characteristic of gastrointestinal epithelial cells","nude rats","study of metastasis","Intrasplenic injections of KI2","rnuDF rats","nude mice","Transmission electron microscopy of KI2","differentiated glandular carcinoma","syngeneic BD","tumors","display metastatic properties","metastatic lesions","nuBR mice","numerous animal tumor models","Macroscopic lung metastases","reproducible pattern of metastatic behavior","properties essential","Distal lymph node metastases","identification of biochemical correlates of metastasis","desmosomes","xenogeneic CRL","junctional complexes","allogeneic RNU","utility","testing of chemotherapeutic agents","dimethylhydrazine","vimentin","antigens","animals","Ca19","sites of trauma","sensitivity","presence of keratin","liver colonization","ability","histological appearances","Secretion of CEA","rat strain","assays","results","groups"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The authors carried out an emergency tracheostomy and changed the tracheostomy tube for one patient and performed elective tracheostomy in another two patients. Results: No medical or nursing staff member was infected after carrying out the procedure while taking all the precautions and wearing the appropriate protective apparel.

We study spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a progressive degenerative disorder of the neuromuscular system caused by the polyQ androgen receptor (AR). Using a knock-in mouse model of SBMA, AR113Q mice, we show that E3 ubiquitin ligases which are a hallmark of the canonical muscle atrophy machinery are not induced in AR113Q muscle. Similarly, we find no evidence to suggest dysfunction of signaling pathways that trigger muscle hypertrophy or impairment of the muscle stem cell niche. Instead, we find that skeletal muscle atrophy is characterized by diminished function of the transcriptional regulator Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2), a regulator of myofiber homeostasis. Decreased expression of MEF2 target genes is age- and glutamine tract length-dependent, occurs due to polyQ AR proteotoxicity, and is associated with sequestration of MEF2 into intranuclear inclusions in muscle. Skeletal muscle from R6/2 mice, a model of Huntington disease which develops progressive atrophy, also sequesters MEF2 into inclusions and displays age-dependent loss of MEF2 target genes. Similarly, SBMA patient muscle shows loss of MEF2 target gene expression, and restoring MEF2 activity in AR113Q muscle rescues fiber size and MEF2-regulated gene expression. This work establishes MEF2 impairment as a novel mechanism of skeletal muscle atrophy downstream of toxic polyglutamine proteins and as a therapeutic target for muscle atrophy in these disorders.

However, peripheral CD4(\u002B) and CD8(\u002B) T cells can also be induced to become regulatory T cells. Here we review our studies using the combination of IL\u20102 and transforming growth factor \u03B2 (TGF\u2010\u03B2) to generate regulatory T cell subsets ex vivo, and the work of others using IL\u201010 to induce suppressive activity. Under certain conditions, the autocrine effects of TGF\u2010\u03B2 and IL\u201010 induce peripheral T cells to produce immunosuppressive levels of each of these cytokines. This effect of TGF\u2010\u03B2 is IL\u20102 dependent. Under other conditions IL\u20102 and TGF\u2010\u03B2 can induce CD4(\u002B) cells to develop potent contact\u2010dependent, cytokine\u2010independent regulatory activity. At present, there is considerable confusion concerning the mechanism of action of CD4(\u002B) CD25(\u002B) cells because cytokine\u2010producing regulatory T cells generated in the periphery can express CD25 and other markers displayed by naturally occurring, thymus\u2010derived regulatory T cells. We, therefore, propose a nomenclature that identifies thymus\u2010derived and peripheral regulatory cells, and that also differentiates T regulatory cells from T helper cells. Because T regulatory cells broadly control T helper cell reactivity, the mechanisms that control regulatory cell function are also reviewed. Finally, the potential use of regulatory T cells generated ex vivo as an adoptive immunotherapy for certain autoimmune diseases, to prevent organ graft rejection, or to prevent pathologic host responses to infectious agents is discussed.","publish_time":"2003-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horwitz, David A.; Zheng, Song Guo; Gray, J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here we evaluated comparatively three different viral antigen\u2010encoding DNA sequences, delivered via two physical means (i.e., gene gun delivery into skin and electroporation delivery into muscle), for naked DNA\u2010mediated vaccination in a mouse system. RESULTS: Both methods gave similar results, demonstrating commonality of the observed DNA vaccine effects. Immunization with a cDNA vector expressing the major viral antigen (VP1) alone routinely failed to induce the production of anti\u2010VP1 or neutralizing antibodies in test mice. As a second approach, the plasmid L\u2010VP1 that produces a transgenic membrane\u2010anchored VP1 protein elicited a strong antibody response, but all test mice failed in the FMDV challenge experiment. In contrast, for mice immunized with the viral capsid precursor protein (P1) cDNA expression vector, both neutralizing antibodies and 80\u2013100% protection in test mice were detected. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy of using the whole capsid precursor protein P1 cDNA for vaccination, intentionally without the use of virus\u2010specific protease or other encoding genes for safety reasons, may thus be employed as a relevant experimental system for induction or upgrading of effective neutralizing antibody response, and as a convenient surrogate test system for DNA vaccination studies of FMDV and presumably other viral diseases.

The prevalence of positive serological tests for SARS\u2010CoV was significantly lower in older patients (42% vs 92%, P\u003C.001). This was largely due to incomplete testing in elderly patients.

The study population was composed of patients with acute respiratory disease warranting presentation to Queensland hospitals. HCoV\u2010NL63 was detected in the nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of 16 of 840 specimens representing 766 patients (2%). HCoV\u2010NL63 positive individuals were diagnosed most commonly with lower respiratory tract (LRT) disease (81%).

However, that role is not clear for grasslands where most precipitation falls during the growing season when the demand for water is high. Our question was: Does litter affect forage production in such an environment? Location: Typical steppe, Inner Mongolia. Methods: We examined the role of plant litter in two experiments where litter was either removed or added in a protected or heavily grazed site, respectively, in autumn and in spring in a split plot design. The treatments (control, moderate and heavy litter application) were applied once in five replications but repeated at new locations in each of 3 years. This was done to examine only the direct effect of litter on annual net primary production and selected plant characteristics and not potential secondary effects. We also measured soil moisture and soil temperature. Results: Removing litter caused a reduction in the amount of grass (Leymus chinensis) that was produced, but litter addition caused an inconsistent effect among years, with moderate applications producing the most positive effects. Litter removal resulted in shorter and less dense plants of L. chinensis and Carex duriuscula, while heavy litter addition in autumn reduced plant height of both Cleistogenes squarrosa and C. duriuscula. Conclusions: Litter was effective for enhancing soil moisture status and reducing soil heat units in the typical steppe of Inner Mongolia. Therefore, litter mass may serve as an index of grassland health in such environments.","publish_time":"2011-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Jing; Zhao, Mengli; Willms, Walter D.; Han, Guodong; Wang, Zhongwu; Bai, Yongfei","journal":"J Veg Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8558d43713e74a39b5c32c297813bc0373f103bc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166792.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166792/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyNjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["C. duriuscula"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Inner Mongolia"],"keyphrases":["Litter removal","litter mass","role of plant litter","heavy litter addition","heavy litter application","direct effect of litter","soil moisture status","soil temperature","soil heat units","forage production","typical steppe of Inner Mongolia","years","Question","autumn reduced plant height","selected plant characteristics","annual net primary production","moderate applications","inconsistent effect","Carex duriuscula","positive effects","Leymus chinensis","potential secondary effects","Cleistogenes squarrosa","dense plants of","control","dead leaves","stems","demand","water","precipitation","growing season","spring","index of grassland health","experiments","split plot design","environments","new locations","grasslands","grazed site","treatments","reduction","replications","Results","Conclusions","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The case records of 90 dyspnoeic cats were retrospectively reviewed and separated into different groups depending on aetiology (cardiac, respiratory, neoplastic and trauma). Duration of clinical signs, presentation, hospitalisation length and survival were analysed. Results: Cardiac (38 per cent), respiratory (32 per cent) and neoplastic (20 per cent) diseases were common causes of feline dyspnoea. Cats with respiratory causes had longer duration of clinical signs (P\u003C0\u00B7001) before presentation. Cats with neoplasia were significantly older (P\u003C0\u00B7001). No significant difference in respiratory rates was present between the groups (P = 0\u00B7154). High heart rates (P\u003C0\u00B7001) and abnormalities on cardiac auscultation were more likely in the cardiac group. Clinical Significance: Frequent causes of dyspnoea in cats were cardiac disease followed by respiratory causes and neoplastic conditions. Heart rate on presentation and presence of heart murmurs or gallops are useful to identify cardiac causes.

While the diagnostics for gastrointestinal bacterial and parasitic pathogens and their etiological role in disease are well established, little is known about the epidemiology, prevalence and role of viral agents in diarrheal illness among monkeys. Methods We collected fecal specimens from monkeys with diarrhea that were housed in two primate colonies, the Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Beijing, China and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Georgia, USA. We screened these fecal specimens for rotaviruses and enteric adenoviruses 40/41 by using commercial EIA kits (Rotaclone and Adenoclone), enteroviruses by RT\u2010PCR and Southern blot hybridization, and picobirnaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Some of the specimens were examined by EM for coronaviruses and noroviruses. Results Of the 92 specimens from China, we found 63 (68%) positive for viruses, including enteroviruses (52%), enteric adenoviruses (21%), rotaviruses (20%), and picobirnaviruses (2%). Coronaviruses were detected in some specimens. Mixed infection of two or more viral agents was seen in 23 (25%) specimens.

This study examines the biodiversity of Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) communities in these scarce Afroalpine lake systems, in order to determine their uniqueness in relation to lowland African lakes and alpine lakes in temperate regions, and to evaluate the potential of Afroalpine Chironomidae as biological indicators to monitor future changes in the ecological integrity of their habitat. Location Mount Kenya (Kenya) and Rwenzori Mountains (Uganda). Methods The species composition of Afroalpine chironomid communities was assessed using recent larval death assemblages extracted from the surface sediments of 11 high\u2010mountain lakes between 2900 and 4575 m. Results were compared with similar faunal data from 68 East African lakes at low and middle elevation (750\u20132760 m), and with literature records of Chironomidae species distribution in sub\u2010Saharan Africa, the Palaearctic region and elsewhere. All recovered taxa were fully described and illustrated. Results The 11\u2010lake analysis yielded 1744 subfossil chironomid larvae belonging to 16 distinct taxa of full\u2010grown larvae, and three taxa of less differentiated juveniles. Eleven of these 16 are not known to occur in African lakes at lower elevation, and eight taxa (or 50% of total species richness) appear restricted to the specific habitat of cold lakes above 3900 m, where night\u2010time freezing is frequent year\u2010round. The faunal transition zone coincides broadly with the Ericaceous zone of terrestrial vegetation (c. 3000\u20134000 m). Snowline depression during the Quaternary ice ages must have facilitated dispersion of cold\u2010stenothermous species among the high mountains of equatorial East Africa, but less so from or to the Palaearctic region via the Ethiopian highlands. Main conclusions Chironomid communities in glacier\u2010fed lakes on Africa\u0027s highest mountains are highly distinct from those of lowland African lakes, and potentially unique on a continental scale. By virtue of excellent preservation and their spatial and temporal integration of local community dynamics, chironomid larval death assemblages extracted from surface sediments are powerful biological indicators for monitoring the hydrological and ecological changes associated with the current retreat and loss of Africa\u0027s glaciers.","publish_time":"2006-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eggermont, Hilde; Verschuren, Dirk","journal":"J Biogeogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b4560d515f8316f973d040952aa98e50f29c8a3f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167042.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167042/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kenya","Rwenzori Mountains","Africa"],"keyphrases":["alpine lakes","East African lakes","lowland African lakes","mountain lakes","specific habitat of cold lakes","species composition of Afroalpine chironomid communities","ecology of unique tropical cold\u2010water lakes","high mountains of tropical Africa","high mountains of equatorial East Africa","chironomid larval death assemblages","stenothermous species","Rwenzori Mountains","recovered taxa","subfossil chironomid larvae","potential of Afroalpine Chironomidae","Africa\u0027s highest mountains","Main conclusions Chironomid communities","distinct taxa of full\u2010grown larvae","surface sediments","sub\u2010Saharan Africa","literature records of Chironomidae species distribution","biodiversity of Chironomidae","total species richness","ecological changes","loss of Africa\u0027s glaciers","Palaearctic region","Results","recent larval death assemblages","scarce Afroalpine lake systems","powerful biological indicators","complete loss of glaciers","faunal transition zone","future changes","dispersion of cold","ecological integrity","lake analysis","middle elevation","lower elevation","similar faunal data","Location Mount Kenya","Ericaceous zone of terrestrial vegetation","temporal integration of local community dynamics","hydrology","order","Diptera","current retreat","relation","profound impacts","Quaternary ice ages","uniqueness","temperate regions","Snowline depression","virtue of excellent preservation","Insecta","Methods","night\u2010time freezing","Ethiopian highlands","Uganda","Anthropogenic climate change","continental scale","study","differentiated juveniles"],"language":"en"},

Molecular tests have been developed to detect SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) RNA using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) with varying levels of sensitivity. However, RNA amplification methods have been demonstrated to be more sensitive for the detection of some RNA viruses. We therefore developed a real\u2010time nucleic acid sequence\u2010based amplification (NASBA) test for SARS\u2010CoV. A number of primer/beacon sets were designed to target different regions of the SARS\u2010CoV genome, and were tested for sensitivity and specificity. The performance of the assays was compared with RT\u2010PCR assays. A multi\u2010target real\u2010time NASBA application was developed for detection of SARS\u2010CoV polymerase (Pol) and nucleocapsid (N) genes.

The pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is at present poorly understood, but advanced age and serum total lactate dehydrogenase (LD) activity \u003E300 U L(\u22121) have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Blood leucocytes and lymphocyte subsets were reported to decrease, respectively, in 47% and up to 100% of 38 patients in Beijing. However, their prognostic implications have not been thoroughly investigated. Objective. To investigate serum total LD, LD isoenzymes, and other parameters including blood lymphocyte subsets as prognostic indicators in SARS patients for adverse clinical outcomes in terms of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and death. Design. Retrospective analysis. Subjects and methods. A total of 109 patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS according to the modified World Health Organization case definition of SARS were recruited from two major acute hospitals in Hong Kong. They were either involved in the initial outbreak of SARS, or cases from the community outbreak of Amoy Gardens between 10 March and 5 May 2003. The clinical diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by serological test and/or molecular analysis. Serum total LD and LD isoenzyme activities, complete blood picture with total leucocyte count and differential counts, absolute counts of CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B, natural killer cells and B lymphocytes were measured daily upon admission. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine and compare different cut\u2010offs for various biochemical and immunological parameters at peak serum total LD concentration in predicting adverse clinical outcomes. Results. Of a total of 109 patients, 41 were admitted to ICU and 42 died. Of 42 fatal patients, 24 died in ICU and 18 died in general medical wards. Age was found to be an independent prognostic indictor for death with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.90\u20130.99] but not for admission to ICU [AUC = 0.61 (CI = 0.51\u20130.70)]. Whilst serum total LD could only achieve AUC of 0.68 (CI = 0.59\u20130.77) for predicting death, LD1 isoenzyme was found to be the best biochemical prognostic indicator with AUC of 0.84 (CI = 0.75\u20130.90), sensitivity of 62% (CI = 46\u201376%), specificity of 93% (CI = 83\u201398%) at cut\u2010off activity of \u226580 U L(\u22121). CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B and natural killer cell counts were promising immunological prognostic indicators for predicting admission to ICU with AUC of 0.94 (CI = 0.86\u20130.98), 0.91 (CI = 0.81\u20130.96), 0.93 (CI = 0.85\u20130.98), and 0.87 (CI = 0.76\u20130.94), respectively. Conclusions. Apart from age, serum LD1 activity was the best prognostic indicator for predicting death in patients with SARS compared with serum total LD activity, haemoglobin concentration, leucocyte and lymphocyte counts. Its release could possibly be from blood erythrocytes and body tissues other than the myocardium. Blood CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B and natural killer cell counts were found to be good prognostic indicators for predicting admission to ICU in patients with SARS compared with age, leucocyte count and LD isoenzymes. The suppressed CD3\u002B, CD4\u002B, CD8\u002B, and natural killer cell counts were also implicated in the pathophysiology of SARS. Patients with increased serum LD1 should be closely monitored to ensure prompt management, and preparation for admission to ICU could be planned ahead for patients with suppressed lymphocyte subsets.","publish_time":"2004-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, M.

Functional classification of identified up\u2010regulated proteins indicated that protein metabolism and modification, particularly in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, was the main biological process occurring in SARS CoV 3CLpro\u2010expressing cells. Thirty\u2010six percent of identified up\u2010regulated proteins were located in the mitochondria, including apoptosis\u2010inducing factor, ATP synthase beta chain and cytochrome c oxidase. Interestingly, heat shock cognate 71\u2010kDa protein (HSP70), which antagonizes apoptosis\u2010inducing factor was shown to down\u2010regulate and had a 5.29\u2010fold decrease. In addition, confocal image analysis has shown release of mitochondrial apoptogenic apoptosis\u2010inducing factor and cytochrome c into the cytosol. Our results revealed that SARS CoV 3CLpro could be considered to induce mitochondrial\u2010mediated apoptosis.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the differences in clinical findings between survivors and non\u2010survivors of humidifier disinfectant\u2010associated children\u0027s interstitial lung disease. To evaluate dynamic changes in serum cytokines related to inflammation and fibrosis in lung injury, and to determine whether these changes are predictive of survival in this disease. METHODS: We evaluated 17 children with humidifier disinfectant\u2010associated children\u0027s interstitial lung disease, from whom serum samples were obtained weekly during hospitalization. The severity of chest tomographic and lung pathologic findings was scored. Levels of several cytokines were measured in the serial serum samples. RESULTS: Seven of the 17 children were survivors. Compared to survivors, non\u2010survivors had greater ground\u2010glass attenuation on follow\u2010up chest tomography, higher admission neutrophil counts, and more macrophages on pathologic findings. Transforming growth factor\u2010beta 1 persisted at an elevated level (1,000\u20131,500 pg/ml) in survivors, whereas it decreased abruptly in non\u2010survivors. At the time of this decrease, non\u2010survivors had clinical worsening of their respiratory failure. Transforming growth factor\u2010beta 1 was positively correlated with PaO(2)/FiO(2) (r = 0.481, P \u003C 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Non\u2010survivors exhibited more inflammatory clinical findings than survivors. Transforming growth factor\u2010beta 1 remained elevated in survivors, suggesting that it affected the clinical course of humidifier disinfectant\u2010associated children\u0027s interstitial lung disease. The prognosis of this lung disease may depend more on controlling excessive inflammation and repairing damaged lung than on fibrosis, and transforming growth factor\u2010beta 1 may play a key role in this process.

A deadly communicable disease outbreak, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Toronto in 2003, amplifies the difficulties of hospital priority setting. The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate priority setting in a hospital in response to SARS using the ethical framework \u0027accountability for reasonableness\u0027. METHODS: This study was conducted at a large tertiary hospital in Toronto, Canada. There were two data sources: 1) over 200 key documents (e.g. emails, bulletins), and 2) 35 interviews with key informants. Analysis used a modified thematic technique in three phases: open coding, axial coding, and evaluation. RESULTS: Participants described the types of priority setting decisions, the decision making process and the reasoning used. Although the hospital leadership made an effort to meet the conditions of \u0027accountability for reasonableness\u0027, they acknowledged that the decision making was not ideal. We described good practices and opportunities for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: \u0027Accountability for reasonableness\u0027 is a framework that can be used to guide fair priority setting in health care organizations, such as hospitals.

Unfortunately, the location and length of horizontal transfers (HTs) are known for very few species. The usage of short oligonucleotides in a sequence (the so-called genomic signature) has been shown to be species-specific even in DNA fragments as short as 1 kb. The genomic signature is therefore proposed as a tool to detect HTs. Since DNA transfers originate from species with a signature different from those of the recipient species, the analysis of local variations of signature along recipient genome may allow for detecting exogenous DNA. The strategy consists in (i) scanning the genome with a sliding window, and calculating the corresponding local signature (ii) evaluating its deviation from the signature of the whole genome and (iii) looking for similar signatures in a database of genomic signatures. A total of 22 prokaryote genomes are analyzed in this way. It has been observed that atypical regions make up \u223C6% of each genome on the average. Most of the claimed HTs as well as new ones are detected. The origin of putative DNA transfers is looked for among \u223C12 000 species. Donor species are proposed and sometimes strongly suggested, considering similarity of signatures.

The projections containing high resolution information are usually very noisy. This paper proposes a new method, based on weighted-projection matching in wavelet space for virus orientation determination. In order to speed the retrieval of the best match between projections from a model and real virus particle, a hierarchical correlation matching method is also proposed. RESULTS: A data set of 600 HSV-1 capsid particle images in different orientations was used to test the proposed method. An initial model of about 40 \u00C5 resolutions was used to generate projections of an HSV-1 capsid. Results show that a significant improvement, in terms of accuracy and speed, is obtained for the initial orientation estimates of noisy herpes virus images. For the bacteriophage (P22), the proposed method gave the correct reconstruction compared to the model, while the classical method failed to resolve the correct orientations of the smooth spherical P22 viruses. CONCLUSION: This paper introduces a new method for orientation determination of low contrast images and highly noisy virus particles. This method is based on weighted projection matching in wavelet space, which increases the accuracy of the orientations. A hierarchical implementation of this method increases the speed of orientation determination. The estimated number of particles needed for a higher resolution reconstruction increased exponentially. For a 6 \u00C5 resolution reconstruction of the HSV virus, 50,000 particles are necessary. The results show that the proposed method reduces the amount of data needed in a reconstruction by at least 50 %. This may result in savings 2 to 3 man-years invested in acquiring images from the microscope and data processing. Furthermore, the proposed method is able to determine orientations for some difficult particles like P22 with accuracy and consistency. Recently a low PH sindbis capsid was determined with the proposed method, where other methods based on the common line fail.","publish_time":"2005-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saad, Ali Samir","journal":"BMC Struct Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7aa3c6793455d0748b58fc6ff75ab336b2863c6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC555555.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC555555/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["proposed method","new method","classical method","virus orientation determination","HSV virus","noisy virus particles","hierarchical correlation matching method","speed of orientation determination","correct reconstruction","capsid particle images","initial orientation estimates of noisy herpes virus images","\u00C5 resolution reconstruction","orientation determination of low contrast images","real virus particle","acquiring images","correct orientations","D projections","higher resolution reconstruction","RESULTS","D reconstruction of electron microscopic images of viruses","initial model","difficult particles","different orientations","weighted-projection matching","weighted projection matching","wavelet space","terms of accuracy","estimated number of particles","data set","data processing","paper","order","smooth spherical P22 viruses","low PH sindbis capsid","high resolution information","\u00C5 resolutions","hierarchical implementation","methods","retrieval","significant improvement","best match","microscope","Euler angels","common line fail","man-years","consistency","CONCLUSION","bacteriophage","savings","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

We constructed primers for inefficient reverse transcription of ribosomal sequences based on the distribution analysis of hexanucleotide patterns in ribosomal RNA. The analysis revealed that distributions of hexanucleotide patterns in ribosomal RNA and virus genome were different. We constructed 96 hexanucleotides (non-ribosomal hexanucleotides) and used them as mixed primers for reverse transcription of cDNA RDA. A synchronous analysis of hexanucleotide patterns in known viral sequences showed that all the known genomic-size viral sequences include non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. In a model experiment, when non-ribosomal hexanucleotides were used as primers, in vitro transcribed plasmid RNA was efficiently reverse transcribed when compared with ribosomal RNA of rat cells. Using non-ribosomal primers, the cDNA fragments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 were efficiently amplified by subtracting the cDNA amplicons derived from uninfected cells from those that were derived from virus-infected cells. The results suggest that cDNA RDA with non-ribosomal primers can be used for species-independent detection of viruses, including new viruses.","publish_time":"2005-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Endoh, Daiji; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Kirisawa, Rikio; Maki, Yoshiyuki; Saito, Hidetoshi; Kon, Yasuhiro; Morikawa, Shigeru; Hayashi, Masanobu","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5ae641a5bf24b53a895f5f2f04254cc00e909c08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1074749.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1074749/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["cDNA RDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-ribosomal primers","non-ribosomal hexanucleotides","ribosomal RNA of rat cells","RNA virus genomes","reverse transcription of cDNA RDA","cDNA amplicons","inefficient reverse transcription of ribosomal sequences","vast quantity of ribosomal RNAs","cDNA representational difference analysis","isolation of genomic fragments of RNA virus","transcribed plasmid RNA","mixed primers","virus-infected cells","distribution analysis of hexanucleotide patterns","synchronous analysis of hexanucleotide patterns","bovine parainfluenza virus","distributions of hexanucleotide patterns","cDNA fragments of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","known genomic-size viral sequences","uninfected cells","new viruses","subtraction of poly","species-independent detection of viruses","model experiment","method","results"],"language":"en"},

By contrast, in traditional taxonomy, specimens are usually identified by \u0027dichotomous keys\u0027 that use combinations of characters shared by different members of the target set. Using one specific character for each target is the least efficient strategy for identification. Using combinations of shared bisectionally-distributed characters is much more efficient, and this strategy is most efficient when they separate the targets in a progressively binary way. RESULTS: We have developed a practical method for finding minimal sets of sub-sequences that identify individual sequences, and could be targeted by combinations of probes, so that the efficient strategy of traditional taxonomic identification could be used in DNA diagnosis. The sizes of minimal sub-sequence sets depended mostly on sequence diversity and sub-sequence length and interactions between these parameters. We found that 201 distinct cytochrome oxidase subunit-1 (CO1) genes from moths (Lepidoptera) were distinguished using only 15 sub-sequences 20 nucleotides long, whereas only 8\u201310 sub-sequences 6\u201310 nucleotides long were required to distinguish the CO1 genes of 92 species from the 9 largest orders of insects. CONCLUSION: The presence/absence of sub-sequences in a set of gene sequences can be used like the questions in a traditional dichotomous taxonomic key; hybridisation probes complementary to such sub-sequences should provide a very efficient means for identifying individual species, subtypes or genotypes. Sequence diversity and sub-sequence length are the major factors that determine the numbers of distinguishing sub-sequences in any set of sequences.","publish_time":"2005-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gibbs, Mark J; Armstrong, John S; Gibbs, Adrian J","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6184d2db86268ba31e49b03a5aab475d5ce5ca6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1090557.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1090557/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEwMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["absence of sub-sequences","set of sequences","sub-sequence length","minimal sets of sub-sequences","individual sequences","numbers of distinguishing sub-sequences","set of gene sequences","sequence diversity","sizes of minimal sub-sequence sets","efficient strategy of traditional taxonomic identification","efficient means","target set","target species","combinations of probes","individual species","combinations of characters","traditional dichotomous taxonomic key","traditional taxonomy","specific oligonucleotide probes","CO1 genes","DNA diagnosis","nucleotides","current DNA diagnostic tests","dichotomous keys\u0027","distributed characters","specific character","organisms","hybridisation","major factors","different members","questions","interactions","distinct cytochrome oxidase subunit","BACKGROUND","specimens","subtypes","practical method","presence","contrast","moths","Lepidoptera","targets","genotypes","parameters","largest orders of insects","binary way","CONCLUSION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

A key variable predicted by early warning systems is the final outbreak size. However, for directly transmitted diseases, the stochastic contact process by which outbreaks develop entails fundamental limits to the precision with which the final size can be predicted. METHODS AND FINDINGS: I studied how the expected final outbreak size and the coefficient of variation in the final size of outbreaks scale with control effectiveness and the rate of infectious contacts in the simple stochastic epidemic. As examples, I parameterized this model with data on observed ranges for the basic reproductive ratio (R (0)) of nine directly transmitted diseases. I also present results from a new model, the simple stochastic epidemic with delayed-onset intervention, in which an initially supercritical outbreak (R (0) \u003E 1) is brought under control after a delay. CONCLUSION: The coefficient of variation of final outbreak size in the subcritical case (R (0) \u003C 1) will be greater than one for any outbreak in which the removal rate is less than approximately 2.41 times the rate of infectious contacts, implying that for many transmissible diseases precise forecasts of the final outbreak size will be unattainable. In the delayed-onset model, the coefficient of variation (CV) was generally large (CV \u003E 1) and increased with the delay between the start of the epidemic and intervention, and with the average outbreak size. These results suggest that early warning systems for infectious diseases should not focus exclusively on predicting outbreak size but should consider other characteristics of outbreaks such as the timing of disease emergence.","publish_time":"2005-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Drake, John M","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c457f06e9474f83c6451e8740c24aebe35428408.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1288026.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1288026/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expected final outbreak size","average outbreak size","predicting outbreak size","final size of outbreaks scale","supercritical outbreak","outbreaks of infectious diseases","Early warning systems","coefficient of variation","rate of infectious contacts","simple stochastic epidemic","characteristics of outbreaks","delayed-onset model","new model","transmissible diseases precise forecasts","delayed-onset intervention","removal rate","CV","stochastic contact process","control effectiveness","present results","observed ranges","important application","basic reproductive ratio","subcritical case","data","key variable","precision","times","BACKGROUND","ecological theory of epidemics","timing of disease emergence","start","fundamental limits","FINDINGS","CONCLUSION","METHODS","examples"],"language":"en"},

We previously demonstrated that patients with H5N1 disease had unusually high serum levels of IP-10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10). Furthermore, when compared with human influenza virus subtype H1N1, the H5N1 viruses in 1997 (A/Hong Kong/483/97) (H5N1/97) were more potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-a) and chemokines (e.g. IP-10) from primary human macrophages in vitro, which suggests that cytokines dysregulation may play a role in pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. Since respiratory epithelial cells are the primary target cell for replication of influenza viruses, it is pertinent to investigate the cytokine induction profile of H5N1 viruses in these cells. METHODS: We used quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA to compare the profile of cytokine and chemokine gene expression induced by H5N1 viruses A/HK/483/97 (H5N1/97), A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/Vietnam/3046/04 (both H5N1/04) with that of human H1N1 virus in human primary alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. RESULTS: We demonstrated that in comparison to human H1N1 viruses, H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses were more potent inducers of IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in primary human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Recent H5N1 viruses from Vietnam (H5N1/04) appeared to be even more potent at inducing IP-10 than H5N1/97 virus. CONCLUSION: The H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 subtype influenza A viruses are more potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary human respiratory epithelial cells than subtype H1N1 virus.

SARS-CoV ORF 3a encodes a minor structural protein of 274 amino acids. Over the course of cloning and expression of the gene, a mixed population of clones with six, seven, eight and nine T stretches located 14 nt downstream of the initiation codon was found. In vitro and in vivo expression of clones with six, seven and eight Ts, respectively, showed the detection of the full-length 3a protein. Mutagenesis studies led to the identification of the hepta- and octo-uridine stretches as slippery sequences for efficient frameshifting. Interestingly, no stimulatory elements were found in the sequences upstream or downstream of the slippage site. When the hepta- and octo-uridine stretches were used to replace the original slippery sequence of the SARS-CoV ORF 1a and 1b, efficient frameshift events were observed.

The study was carried out to investigate the association between the genetic polymorphisms of 2\u0027,5\u0027-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) gene as well as myxovirus resistance 1 (MxA) gene and susceptibility to SARS in Chinese Han population. METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted. A collective of 66 SARS cases and 64 close contact uninfected controls were enrolled in this study. End point real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-based Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were used to detect the single nucleic polymorphisms (SNPs) in OAS1 and MxA genes. Information on other factors associated with SARS infection was collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were conducted. RESULTS: One polymorphism in the 3\u0027-untranslated region (3\u0027-UTR) of the OAS1 gene was associated with SARS infection. Compared to AA genotype, AG and GG genotypes were found associated with a protective effect on SARS infection with ORs (95% CI) of 0.42 (0.20~0.89) and 0.30 (0.09~0.97), respectively. Also, a GT genotype at position 88 in the MxA gene promoter was associated with increased susceptibility to SARS infection compared to a GG genotype (OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.25~7.50). The associations of AG genotype in OAS1 and GT genotype in MxA remained significant in multivariate analyses after adjusting for SARS protective measures (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14~0.98 and OR = 3.22, 95% CI: 1.13~9.18, respectively).

Although individual, identifiable patient records are essential for conditions for which there is mandated reporting, such as tuberculosis or sexually transmitted diseases, they are not routinely required for effective syndromic surveillance. Public concern about the routine collection of large quantities of PHI to support non-traditional public health functions may make alternative surveillance methods that do not rely on centralized identifiable PHI databases increasingly desirable. METHODS: The National Bioterrorism Syndromic Surveillance Demonstration Program (NDP) is an example of one alternative model. All PHI in this system is initially processed within the secured infrastructure of the health care provider that collects and holds the data, using uniform software distributed and supported by the NDP. Only highly aggregated count data is transferred to the datacenter for statistical processing and display. RESULTS: Detailed, patient level information is readily available to the health care provider to elucidate signals observed in the aggregated data, or for ad hoc queries. We briefly describe the benefits and disadvantages associated with this distributed processing model for routine automated syndromic surveillance. CONCLUSION: For well-defined surveillance requirements, the model can be successfully deployed with very low risk of inadvertent disclosure of PHI \u2013 a feature that may make participation in surveillance systems more feasible for organizations and more appealing to the individuals whose PHI they hold. It is possible to design and implement distributed systems to support non-routine public health needs if required.","publish_time":"2006-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lazarus, Ross; Yih, Katherine; Platt, Richard","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b43f61d164be997a34343c11c70c42edd91898b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1618842.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1618842/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHI","The National Bioterrorism Syndromic Surveillance Demonstration Program","NDP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["routine public health surveillance","surveillance systems","routine automated syndromic surveillance","effective syndromic surveillance","alternative surveillance methods","health care provider","identifiable personal health information","centralized identifiable PHI databases","non-routine public health needs","non-traditional public health functions","well-defined surveillance requirements","distributed systems","routine collection of large quantities of PHI","identifiable patient records","distributed processing model","Public concern","alternative model","aggregated data","National Bioterrorism Syndromic Surveillance Demonstration Program","centralized collection","low risk of inadvertent disclosure of PHI","NDP","aggregated count data","patient level information","statistical processing","conditions","datacenter","organizations","feature","signals","secured infrastructure","tuberculosis","RESULTS","example","disadvantages","participation","mandated reporting","display","individuals","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","uniform software","transmitted diseases","benefits","queries"],"language":"en"}]}

Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity. Results We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country. Conclusions As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Haoyang; Dickens, Borame Lee; Chen, Mark; Cook, Alex Richard; Clapham, Hannah Eleanor","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6d2875c8b70a41ea815511417546a0689816964.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024075","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Thailand","Indonesia","Asia"],"keyphrases":["mainland China","Wuhan","recipient countries","outside Asia","donor country","recipient country","risk of onward local transmission","local outbreak risk estimate","experiencing local transmission","source country","country connectivity","reported number of cases","estimated number of imported cases","widespread transmission","introduction index","relative potential of case importation","under-detected COVID","SARS-CoV","possibilities of viral introduction","potential locations","pair of donor","uncertainty distribution","novel coronavirus","coronavirus disease","accounting","alert","flight data","estimates","branching process model","territory","emergence","Thailand","territories","Conclusions","Indonesia","deaths","Methods","addition","date","epicentres"],"language":"en"},

Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people after China. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. Methods: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 26 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative logistic distribution. We then produced an estimate of the overall number of potentially infected individuals and epidemic duration at a national and Regional level, for the most affected Regions. Results: We reported the daily distribution of performed swabs and confirmed cases, and the cumulative distribution of confirmed cases, of patients quarantined at home (42%), hospitalized in non-intensive care (31%), recovered or discharged (13%), deceased (10%), and hospitalized in intensive care (4%). The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 115,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic not less than 2 months. Conclusions: Once month after the first outbreaks there seems to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decision-makers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Megna, Rosario","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07ec6ec17b985f1d7b28bc25f2042c2ba1c47177.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044628","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjszNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Service"],"locations":["North","China"],"keyphrases":["Italy","number of infected persons","greatest number of infected people","overall number","number of infections","epidemic duration","forecast model","infected individuals","large number of severe cases","cumulative distribution of confirmed cases","daily distribution","patients","cumulative logistic distribution","asymptomatic people","country","non-intensive care","outbreaks of COVID","National Health Service","heavy burden","Regional level","collaborative efforts","order","hospitalization of thousands","weeks","swabs","China","decision-makers","data","Italian Authorities","areas","decrease","affected Regions","period","high contagiousness","Background","North","descending phase","half","signs","estimate","Results","home","information","thanks","Conclusions","Methods","months","deceased"],"language":"en"},

Besides, it is unclear how stable the COVID-19 virus is under dry and wet conditions. In the present study, we have shown that the COVID-19 virus is extremely infectious as manifested by the infection of Vero-E6 cells by one PFU (Plaque Forming Unit) of the virus. We then investigated the stability of the COVID-19 virus in wet, dry and acidic (pH2.2) environments at room temperature. Results showed that the COVID-19 virus could survive for three days in wet and dry environments, but the dry condition is less favorable for the survival of the virus. Our study also demonstrated that the COVID-19 virus at a relative high titer (1.2 x 103 PFU) exhibits a certain degree of tolerance to acidic environment at least for 60 minutes. When the virus titer was \u22641.0 x 103 PFU, acid treatment (pH2.2) for 30 or 60 minute resulted in virus inactivation. It suggests that the virus at a high concentration may survive in the acidic environment of the stomach.

SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious pathogen that rapidly spread around the world causing the worst pandemic in the past 100 years. SARS-CoV-2 shares high sequence homology with SARS-CoV and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), leading to pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although probably not as lethal as SARS-CoV, its robust transmissibility by asymptomatic individuals is an important contributor to the pandemic. Like other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 encodes four major structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and envelope (E). SARS-CoV E protein is abundant in infected cells and plays a crucial role in viral particle assembly. Moreover, the E proteins of SARS coronaviruses likely have important roles in pathogenesis by manipulating a number of cellular processes. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 E protein could also be a critical virulence factor. Ectopic expression of SARS-CoV E was reported to trigger apoptotic cell death of T lymphocytes, which could potentially contribute to the lymphopenia observed in fatal cases, though a causal association is unproven. A potential mechanism for inducing apoptosis was reported to involve an interaction between a putative Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-like motif in SARS-CoV E and the anti-apoptotic host protein Bcl-xL. Here we provide the first computational evidence indicating that both the SARS-CoV E and SARS-CoV-2 E have a C-terminal BH3-like motif. We used available sequence data for SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses combined with structural information to evaluate the structure to biological activity relationships of the SARS-CoV-2 E BH3-like motif. Our analysis reveals a predicted interactome for E that is extensively wired to the Bcl-2 apoptotic switch that could potentially be a therapeutic target. Last, network reconstruction identified both the BH3-binding protein Bcl-xL and the autophagy effector Beclin 1, another BH3-containing protein, as vulnerable nodes in the host cellular defense system against SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Navratil, Vincent; Lionnard, Lo\u00EFc; Longhi, Sonia; Hardwick, J.

Abstract The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis.

As of April 15, 2020 FDA recommendations only allowed for the use of nasopharyngeal, flocked mid turbinate, or foam nasal swabs, all of which are in very low supply. Polyester swabs are more readily available and mass producible. We compare the performance of polyester and foam swabs stored in different transport media. Methods: Both polyester and foam nasal swabs were collected from convalescent COVID-19 patients at a single visit. Using the foam nasal swabs as the comparator, sensitivity of the polyester swabs in each media were calculated, three by three tables were constructed to measure concordance, and cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared. Findings: 126 visits had polyester and foam swabs stored in viral transport media (VTM), 51 had polyester and foam swabs stored in saline, and 63 had a foam swab in VTM and a polyester swab stored in a dry tube. Using nasal foam swabs as a comparator, polyester nasal swabs had a sensitivity of 86*5% when both samples were stored in VTM, 86*7% when both samples were stored in saline, and 72*4% when the polyester swab was stored dry and the foam swab was stored in VTM. Polyester and foam Ct values from the same visit were correlated, but polyester swabs showed decreased performance for cases with a viral load near the detection threshold and higher Ct values on average. Interpretation: Polyester nasal swabs showed a reduction in performance from foam nasal swabs, but may still provide a viable sample collection method given the current supply shortages and public health emergency.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hart, B.; Tu, Y.-P.; Jennings, R.; Verma, P.; Padgett, L.; Rains, D.; Vojta, D.; Berke, E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8bdfa4c0edee1d8c41fb8e5dabd173ad59bdafeb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20083055v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA","VTM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Polyester swabs","polyester nasal swabs","foam nasal swabs","nasal foam swabs","performance of polyester","foam Ct values","VTM","higher Ct values","viral transport media","current supply shortages","cases","comparator","decreased performance","different transport media","low supply","sensitivity","saline","samples","viral load","detection threshold","cycle threshold","convalescent COVID","testing workflow","single visit","dry tube","exponential growth of COVID","reduction","mid turbinate","various points","viable sample collection method","public health emergency","use of nasopharyngeal","patients","concordance","average","visits","Background","Methods","Interpretation","mass producible","FDA recommendations","Findings","tables"],"language":"en"},

METHODS This was a cross-sectional study of the right eyes of 181 subjects: 89 POAG patients and 92 healthy subjects. Using the Triton SS-OCT device (Topcon, Tokyo, Japan), CM length (CML), area (CMA) and thickness measured 1000 \u00B5m (CMT1), 2000 \u00B5m (CMT2) and 3000 \u00B5m (CMT3) from the scleral spur were determined in the temporal and nasal quadrants. POAG patients were subjected to visual field (VF) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) assessment. CM dimensions were then assessed for correlation with VF mean defect (MD), mean RNFL thickness and intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS Mean CMLs were 4325 \u00B1 340 \u00B5m and 4195 \u00B1 843 \u00B5m for the healthy subjects and POAG patients, respectively (p = 0.17). Mean CM thicknesses were CMT1 = 546 \u00B1 56 \u00B5m, CMT2 = 326 \u00B1 44 \u00B5m and CMT3 = 174 \u00B1 16 \u00B5m in the healthy eyes versus CMT1 = 534 \u00B1 108, CMT2 = 332 \u00B1 99 and CMT3 = 183 \u00B1 74 in the POAG eyes, with no significant differences detected (all p \u2265 0.25). In the temporal quadrant, mean CMA was 1.12 \u00B1 0.29 mm2 and 1.15 \u00B1 0.24 mm2 for the healthy and POAG subjects, respectively (p = 0.45). No correlations were observed between CM measurements and RNFL thickness (p \u2265 0.15), IOP or VF MD (p \u2265 0.14) in POAG subjects irrespective of glaucoma severity (p \u2265 0.19). CONCLUSIONS While SS-OCT proved useful to measure CM dimensions in vivo, these dimensions did not differ between healthy individuals and POAG subjects. In the patients with POAG, no correlations were detected between CM dimensions and VF, RNFL or IOP.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kudsieh, Bachar; Fern\u00E1ndez-Vigo, Jos\u00E9 Ignacio; Shi, Hang; De Pablo G\u00F3mez de Lia\u00F1o, Luc\u00EDa; Ruiz-Moreno, Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa; Garc\u00EDa-Feij\u00F3o, Juli\u00E1n; Fern\u00E1ndez-Vigo, Jos\u00E9 \u00C1ngel","journal":"International ophthalmology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-020-01405-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388672/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["POAG","VF","CMA","RNFL","IOP"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["POAG subjects","\u00B5m","POAG patients","healthy subjects","POAG eyes","dimensions","healthy eyes","mean RNFL thickness","healthy individuals","mean CMA","VF MD","IOP","CMT1","correlations","CMT2","CMT3","measurements","right eyes","Triton SS","mm2","glaucoma severity","temporal quadrant","primary open-angle glaucoma","peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer","visual field","Japan","device","Topcon","defect","intraocular pressure","source optical coherence tomography","length","Tokyo","cross-sectional study","assessment","area","significant differences","scleral spur","ciliary muscle","METHODS","nasal quadrants","CONCLUSIONS","CMLs","covariates","thicknesses","RESULTS","PURPOSE"],"language":"en"},

The Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults was commonly used to assess health literacy levels. Selection of variables and their operationalization were informed by a theoretical model in 12 studies. Age, gender, race/ethnicity, and insurance status were reported antecedents to health literacy. The most commonly tested mediators were self-efficacy (n = 8) and disease knowledge (n = 4). Fit indices reported in the studies ranged from acceptable to excellent. DISCUSSION Current evidence supports self-efficacy as a mediator between health literacy and health behavior. Further research is needed to identify how health literacy interplays with known psychosocial factors to inform people\u0027s use of preventive care services. Future studies should include more disadvantaged populations such as immigrants with high disease burden and those with low health literacy. Theory-based, empirically tested health literacy models can serve as the conceptual basis for developing effective health interventions to improve health behaviors and ultimately decrease the burden of disease in such vulnerable populations. [HLRP: Health Literacy Research and Practice. 2020;4(1):e21-e44.] PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: This review systemically compiles, and critically appraises 20 existing studies that test conceptual frameworks that propose potential pathways through which health literacy affects health behaviors. The findings from this review can help inform the development of health literacy-focused interventions to improve the health behaviors of populations with disease burdens.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cudjoe, Joycelyn; Delva, Sabianca; Cajita, Mia; Han, Hae-Ra","journal":"Health literacy research and practice","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3928/24748307-20191025-01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32053206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Literacy Research and Practice"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["health literacy influences health behaviors","Health Literacy Research","health literacy interplays","low health literacy","BACKGROUND Health literacy","health literacy levels","health behaviors of populations","various health behaviors","certain health behaviors","tested health literacy models","effective health interventions","overall health status","health information sharing","significant determinant of health behaviors","development of health literacy-focused interventions","Short Test of Functional Health Literacy","Future studies","existing studies","eligible studies","burden of disease","disease burdens","disease knowledge","high disease burden","self-efficacy","chronic disease self-management","potential pathways","tested mediators","conceptual basis","conceptual frameworks","disadvantaged populations","vulnerable populations","systematic review","insurance status","oral care","proposed mechanism","people\u0027s use of preventive care services","known psychosocial factors","electronic databases PubMed","race","ethnicity","Embase","immigrants","Adults","DISCUSSION Current evidence","operationalization","searches","CINAHL","HLRP","Practice","antecedents","physical activity","KEY RESULTS","emergency department visits","gender","PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY","theoretical model","United States","medication adherence","cancer screening","shared decision-making","Selection of variables","METHODS","purpose","analysis","Fit indices","cross-sectional design","Theory","e21-e44","findings"],"language":"en"},

However, the specific phagocytic receptor that mediates microglial phagocytosis after ischemic stroke is unknown. AIM To investigate whether P2Y6 receptor-mediated microglial phagocytosis is beneficial for the debris clearance and functional recovery after ischemic stroke. RESULTS The expression of the P2Y6 receptor in microglia increased within 3 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Inhibition of microglial phagocytosis by the selective inhibitor MRS2578 enlarged the brain atrophy and edema volume after ischemic stroke, subsequently aggravated neurological function as measured by modified neurological severity scores and Grid walking test. MRS2578 treatment had no effect on the expression of IL-1\u03B1, IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03B1, TGF-\u03B2, and MPO after ischemic stroke. Finally, we found that the expression of myosin light chain kinase decreased after microglial phagocytosis inhibition in the ischemic mouse brain, which suggested that myosin light chain kinase was involved in P2Y6 receptor-mediated phagocytosis. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that P2Y6 receptor-mediated microglial phagocytosis plays a beneficial role during the acute stage of ischemic stroke, which can be a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wen, Ruo-Xue; Shen, Hui; Huang, Shu-Xian; Wang, Li-Ping; Li, Zong-Wei; Peng, Peng; Mamtilahun, Muyassar; Tang, Yao-Hui; Shen, Fan-Xia; Tian, Heng-Li; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Zhang, Zhi-Jun","journal":"CNS neuroscience \u0026 therapeutics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cns.13296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32154670/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["P2Y6 receptor-mediated phagocytosis","Inhibition of microglial phagocytosis","microglial phagocytosis inhibition","ischemic mouse brain","ischemic brain injury","acute stage of ischemic stroke","expression of IL","specific phagocytic receptor","expression of myosin light chain kinase","brain atrophy","debris clearance","beneficial role","functional recovery","results","TGF-\u03B2","MRS2578 treatment","TNF-\u03B1","neurological severity scores","aggravated neurological function","selective inhibitor MRS2578","INTRODUCTION Clearance of damaged cells","days","edema volume","transient middle cerebral artery occlusion","Grid walking test","effect","MPO","therapeutic target","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

METHODS Anonymized data from the regional psychiatric care register have been obtained and analyzed. The seven GHPWs care for approximately 1.4 million inhabitants and have a total of 119 beds. RESULTS In the 40-day period (February 21st-March 31st 2020) after the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, compared to a similar 40-day period prior to 21 February, and compared to two 40-day periods of 2019, there has been a marked reduction in psychiatric admission rates. The reduction was explained by voluntary admissions, while there was not a noticeable reduction for involuntary admissions. The reduction was visible for all diagnostic groups, except for a group of \u0027Other\u0027 diagnoses, which includes anxiety disorders, neurocognitive disorders, etc. CONCLUSIONS Large-scale pandemics can modify voluntary admission rates to psychiatric facilities in the early phases following pandemic onset.

However, a common limitation is inadequate reporting of the applicability of the intervention and trial results for people who are \u0022socially disadvantaged\u0022 and this can affect policy-makers\u0027 decisions. We previously developed a framework for identifying health-equity-relevant trials, along with a reporting guideline for transparent reporting. In this study, we provide a descriptive assessment of health-equity considerations in 200 randomly sampled equity-relevant trials. METHODS We developed a search strategy to identify health-equity-relevant trials published between 2013 and 2015. We randomly sorted the 4316 records identified by the search and screened studies until 100 individually randomized (RCTs) and 100 cluster randomized controlled trials (CRTs) were identified. We developed and pilot-tested a data extraction form based on our initial work, to inform the development of our reporting guideline for equity-relevant randomized trials. RESULTS In total, 39 trials (20%) were conducted in a low- and middle-income country and 157 trials (79%) in a high-income country focused on socially disadvantaged populations (78% CRTs, 79% RCTs). Seventy-four trials (37%) reported a subgroup analysis across a population characteristic associated with disadvantage (25% CRT, 49% RCTs), with 19% of included studies reporting subgroup analyses across sex, 9% across race/ethnicity/culture, and 4% across socioeconomic status. No subgroup analyses were reported for place of residence, occupation, religion, education, or social capital. One hundred and forty-one trials (71%) discussed the applicability of their results to one or more socially disadvantaged populations (68% of CRT, 73% of RCT). DISCUSSION In this set of trials, selected for their relevance to health equity, data that were disaggregated for socially disadvantaged populations were rarely reported. We found that even when the data are available, opportunities to analyze health-equity considerations are frequently missed. The recently published equity extension of the Consolidated Reporting Standards for Randomized Trials (CONSORT-Equity) may help improve delineation of hypotheses related to socially disadvantaged populations, and transparency and completeness of reporting of health-equity considerations in RCTs. This study can serve as a baseline assessment of the reporting of equity considerations.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Petkovic, Jennifer; Jull, Janet; Yoganathan, Manosila; Dewidar, Omar; Baird, Sarah; Grimshaw, Jeremy M; Johansson, Kjell Arne; Kristjansson, Elizabeth; McGowan, Jessie; Moher, David; Petticrew, Mark; Robberstad, Bjarne; Shea, Beverley; Tugwell, Peter; Volmink, Jimmy; Wells, George A; Whitehead, Margaret; Cuervo, Luis Gabriel; White, Howard; Taljaard, Monica; Welch, Vivian","journal":"Trials","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-020-4223-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32245522/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsxMTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["health equity","equity-relevant randomized trials","reporting of equity considerations","health-equity considerations","sampled equity-relevant trials","controlled trials","CONSORT-Equity","set of trials","reporting guideline","published equity extension","completeness of reporting","inadequate reporting","transparent reporting","disadvantaged populations","RCTs","Consolidated Reporting Standards","descriptive assessment of health","randomized controlled trial","subgroup analyses","trial results","applicability","subgroup analysis","CRTs","data extraction form","baseline assessment","gold standard study design","included studies","search strategy","screened studies","middle-income country","high-income country","policy-makers\u0027 decisions","religion","education","place of residence","sex","development","opportunities","transparency","initial work","occupation","population characteristic","people","BACKGROUND","cluster","relevance","common limitation","culture","race","social capital","pilot","delineation of hypotheses","effectiveness of interventions","ethnicity","records","METHODS","DISCUSSION","total","framework","socioeconomic status"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of hypoxemia during the recovery period using continuous central-monitoring by pulse oximetry and to characterize the hypoxemia cases. Among the 4065 consecutive esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures under planned moderate sedation, 84 (2.1%) procedures developed unexpected hypoxemia (SpO2 \u2264 90%). Hypoxemia was observed during the procedure, at the end of the procedure, and during the recovery period in 21, 17, and 46 (1.1%) procedures, respectively. More than half of the hypoxemia cases occurred during the recovery period. Many hypoxemia cases were characterized by neither serious co-morbid illness nor low body mass index which have been reported as risk factors of hypoxemia.

Transmission-based precautions to protect residents, employees, and families alike must account for potential risks posed by LTC workers\u0027 second jobs and unpaid care work. This observational study describes the prevalence of their (1) second jobs and (2) unpaid care work for dependent children and/or adult relatives (double- and triple-duty caregiving) overall and by occupational group (registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, or certified nursing assistants). DESIGN A descriptive, secondary analysis of data collected as part of the final wave of the Work, Family and Health Study. SETTING Thirty nursing home facilities located throughout the northeastern United States. PARTICIPANTS A subset of 958 essential, facility-based LTC workers involved in direct patient care. MEASUREMENTS We present information on LTC workers\u0027 demographic characteristics, health, features of their LTC occupation, additional paid work, wages, and double- or triple-duty caregiving roles. RESULTS The majority of LTC workers were certified nursing assistants, followed by licensed practical nurses and registered nurses. Overall, over 70% of these workers agreed or strongly agreed with the following statement: \u0022When you are sick, you still feel obligated to come into work.\u0022 One-sixth had a second job, where they worked an average of 20 hours per week, and over 60% held double- or triple-duty caregiving roles. Additional paid work and unpaid care work characteristics did not significantly differ by occupational group, although the prevalence of second jobs was highest and accompanying work hours were longest among certified nursing assistants. CONCLUSION LTC workers commonly hold second jobs along with double- and triple-duty caregiving roles. To slow the spread of Covid-19, both the paid and unpaid activities of these employees warrant consideration in the identification of appropriate clinical, policy, and informal supports.

Video-assisted debriefing (VAD) adds audio-visual captures and reviews to support traditional verbal debriefing (VD), but evidence evaluating its educational effects has been mixed, with limited attention focusing on its structure development. AIMS This study aimed to 1) investigate the effects of a three-phase VAD in enhancing nursing students\u0027 debriefing experiences and perceived stress compared to VD and 2) to explore its impact on facilitators\u0027 debriefing practices. METHODS A mixed-methods design was adopted. The quantitative phase involved a prospective controlled trial on 145 nursing students from a university in Singapore who were randomized into the intervention cluster (n = 72) and the control cluster (n = 73). The debriefing experience scale (DES), the stress visual analogue scale (Stress VAS), and the debriefing assessment for simulation in healthcare (DASH\u00A9 student version) were used as outcome measures. For the qualitative component, a purposive sample of eight facilitators evaluated their own debriefing practices using the DASH\u00A9 instructor version and each completed an open-ended question survey. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS Students from the intervention cluster significantly improved their debriefing experiences (p = 0.01), experienced comparable stress, and had better impressions of VAD facilitators\u0027 practices (p \u003C 0.001) compared to those in the control cluster. Repeated VAD significantly reduced students\u0027 stress (p \u003C 0.001). Students viewed the VAD facilitators as more effective than the VD facilitators. Three categories were derived from the qualitative comments: the act of debriefing, the crux of VAD, and debriefing for success. CONCLUSION The three-phase VAD significantly improved nursing students\u0027 debriefing experiences without adding extra stress. It also helped to improve facilitators\u0027 practices. Future research will benefit from exploring how experts facilitate the three-phase VAD \u0022on the ground\u0022 and its effect on learning transfer and cost-effectiveness.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, H; Wang, W; Goh, S H L; Wu, X V; M\u00F6relius, E","journal":"Nurse education today","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408245/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["debriefing assessment","act of debriefing","facilitators\u0027 debriefing practices","phase VAD","debriefing experience scale","traditional verbal debriefing","improved nursing students\u0027 debriefing experiences","Repeated VAD","crux of VAD","Stress VAS","perceived stress","extra stress","better impressions of VAD facilitators\u0027 practices","reduced students\u0027 stress","VD facilitators","intervention cluster","control cluster","experienced comparable stress","stress visual analogue scale","quantitative phase","simulation","DASH","qualitative comments","RESULTS Students","Qualitative data","qualitative component","mixed-methods design","student version","instructor version","educational effects","prospective controlled trial","reviews","healthcare","audio-visual captures","knowledge","purposive sample","learners","Singapore","evidence","learning transfer","limited attention","structure development","cost-effectiveness","reflecting","open-ended question survey","content analysis","university","experts","impact","outcome measures","internalizing","BACKGROUND","categories","CONCLUSION","Video","Future research","success","study"],"language":"en"},

Information about the clinical characteristics of infected patients who require intensive care is limited. Objective To characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) in the Lombardy region of Italy. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective case series of 1591 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 referred for ICU admission to the coordinator center (Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u0027 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy) of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network and treated at one of the ICUs of the 72 hospitals in this network between February 20 and March 18, 2020. Date of final follow-up was March 25, 2020. Exposures SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swabs. Main Outcomes and Measures Demographic and clinical data were collected, including data on clinical management, respiratory failure, and patient mortality. Data were recorded by the coordinator center on an electronic worksheet during telephone calls by the staff of the COVID-19 Lombardy ICU Network. Results Of the 1591 patients included in the study, the median (IQR) age was 63 (56-70) years and 1304 (82%) were male. Of the 1043 patients with available data, 709 (68%) had at least 1 comorbidity and 509 (49%) had hypertension. Among 1300 patients with available respiratory support data, 1287 (99% [95% CI, 98%-99%]) needed respiratory support, including 1150 (88% [95% CI, 87%-90%]) who received mechanical ventilation and 137 (11% [95% CI, 9%-12%]) who received noninvasive ventilation. The median positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 14 (IQR, 12-16) cm H2O, and Fio2 was greater than 50% in 89% of patients. The median Pao2/Fio2 was 160 (IQR, 114-220). The median PEEP level was not different between younger patients (n = 503 aged \u226463 years) and older patients (n = 514 aged \u226564 years) (14 [IQR, 12-15] vs 14 [IQR, 12-16] cm H2O, respectively; median difference, 0 [95% CI, 0-0]; P = .94). Median Fio2 was lower in younger patients: 60% (IQR, 50%-80%) vs 70% (IQR, 50%-80%) (median difference, -10% [95% CI, -14% to 6%]; P = .006), and median Pao2/Fio2 was higher in younger patients: 163.5 (IQR, 120-230) vs 156 (IQR, 110-205) (median difference, 7 [95% CI, -8 to 22]; P = .02). Patients with hypertension (n = 509) were older than those without hypertension (n = 526) (median [IQR] age, 66 years [60-72] vs 62 years [54-68]; P \u003C .001) and had lower Pao2/Fio2 (median [IQR], 146 [105-214] vs 173 [120-222]; median difference, -27 [95% CI, -42 to -12]; P = .005). Among the 1581 patients with ICU disposition data available as of March 25, 2020, 920 patients (58% [95% CI, 56%-61%]) were still in the ICU, 256 (16% [95% CI, 14%-18%]) were discharged from the ICU, and 405 (26% [95% CI, 23%-28%]) had died in the ICU. Older patients (n = 786; age \u226564 years) had higher mortality than younger patients (n = 795; age \u226463 years) (36% vs 15%; difference, 21% [95% CI, 17%-26%]; P \u003C .001).

Both genetic factors and environmental factors play an important role in PD pathogenesis and response to treatment. However, PD is clinically heterogeneous and genetically complex, and the exact genetic or environmental causes of this disorder remain unclear. Various approaches for detecting disease-causing genes have recently been made available. In particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have attracted attention for the identification of disease-associated loci of multifactorial disorders. This review introduces GWAS of PD, followed by a discussion about the limitations of GWAS and the major challenges facing geneticists in the post-GWAS era. Alternative strategies to address these challenges are then proposed, such as epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) using next-generation sequencing. To date, however, few reports have described these analyses, and the evidence remains insufficient to confidently identify or exclude rare variants or epigenetic changes in PD. Further analyses are therefore required, using sample sizes in the tens of thousands, extensive functional annotations, and highly targeted hypothesis testing.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morimoto, Yoshiro; Ono, Shinji; Kurotaki, Naohiro; Imamura, Akira; Ozawa, Hiroki","journal":"Journal of neural transmission","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-020-02205-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388794/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GWAS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GWAS of PD","limitations of GWAS","PD pathogenesis","Panic disorder","rare variant association studies","epigenome-wide association studies","environmental factors","genetic factors","post-GWAS era","neuropsychiatric disorder","analyses","environmental causes","rare variants","major challenges","panic attacks","EWAS","important role","tens of thousands","extensive functional annotations","RVAS","geneticists","identification of disease","response","associated loci of multifactorial disorders","disease-causing genes","targeted hypothesis testing","epigenetic changes","attention","sample sizes","Various approaches","excessive anxiety","treatment","discussion","generation sequencing","reports","evidence","Alternative strategies","review","date"],"language":"en"},

The current correction of chin deficiency mostly relies on genioplasty surgery involving osteotomy. To avoid osteotomy, one possible alternative is to enhance bone growth at the mental protuberance area with cell sheet transplantation. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of this approach in a pig model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five 4-month-old pigs were included for mandibular bone marrow aspiration and MSC isolation. Triple-layer MSC sheets were then fabricated and utilized using culture-expanded MSCs. Four weeks after bone marrow aspiration, subperiosteal pockets were created on the labial symphyseal surface, followed by transplantation of autogenous MSC sheets to one randomly chosen side with the other side (control) receiving no transplantation. Six weeks after the surgery, the pigs were euthanized and the specimens from both sides were collected for computed tomography (CT) and histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Measurements between the experimental and control sides were compared using paired t tests. RESULTS MSC sheet fabrication and transplantation were reliably conducted. The labial cortical bone thickness increased significantly with MSC sheet transplantation by an average of 2 mm (p = 0.0001). The average measurements of mineral apposition rate and cell proliferation at the cell sheet side tended to be higher than the control side although the differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1-0.2). Tissue mineral density measurements from CT images and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) measurements from histologic images were identical between the two sides (p \u003E 0.5). CONCLUSION These data provide a proof of concept that autologous MSC sheets may be transplanted to the subperiosteal region of the mandibular symphysis to stimulate local surface bone growth.

This article reports on 141 patients and compares the angioarchitecture and outcomes of embolization of bilateral CSDAVFs with those of unilateral CSDAVFs, with reference to limited demographics (sex and age) of the patients. METHOD From January 2010 to February 2018 a total of 141 consecutive patients with CSDAVFs were referred for transvenous embolization. Bilateral CSDAVFs were found in 20 patients (14.2%, with a mean age of 62.2 years). The angioarchitecture of the 141 patients with CSDAVFs were evaluated by conventional cerebral angiography. We compared the angioarchitecture and treatment outcomes of 20 bilateral and 121 unilateral CSDAVFs, and in relation to the patients\u0027 sex and age. RESULTS Female patients significantly dominated the bilateral CSDAVFs (90%, p = 0.043). Bilateral eye symptoms were significantly more common in bilateral CSDAVFs (p = 0.011), with dominant orbital and cavernous symptoms, and showed statistical significance (p = 0.049 and 0.011, respectively). Occlusion of one CSDAVF may significantly decrease the fistula flow of the other untreated side (n = 13, 65%), leading to less coil utilization for embolization in bilateral CSDAVFs (p \u003C 0.001). There was no statistical significance in the occurrence of occlusion of the inferior petrous sinus(s), in pial vein reflux, and treatment outcomes in the unilateral and bilateral CSDAVFs. CONCLUSION Bilateral CSDAVFs were more dominant in female patients and frequently presented with orbital and cavernous symptoms. Fewer coils were used per lesion in the bilateral CSDAVFs. There was no statistical significance in bilateral and unilateral CSDAVFs in terms of impact of venous drainage, pial vein reflux and treatment outcomes.","publish_time":"2019-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fay, Li-Yu; Luo, Chao-Bao; Chen, Liang-Wei; Wu, Jau-Ching; Wu, Chieh-Hsin; Chang, Feng-Chi; Lin, Chung-Jung","journal":"Clinical neuroradiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-019-00868-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31853611/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["unilateral CSDAVFs","CONCLUSION Bilateral CSDAVFs","simultaneous bilateral CSDAVFs","Bilateral eye symptoms","consecutive patients","treatment outcomes","outcomes of embolization","RESULTS Female patients","cavernous symptoms","statistical significance","angioarchitecture","pial vein reflux","dominant orbital","transvenous embolization","mean age","cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistulas","occurrence of occlusion","patients\u0027 sex","inferior petrous sinus","venous drainage","terms of impact","limited demographics","PURPOSE","reference","relation","lesion","coil utilization","conventional cerebral angiography","fistula flow","total","Fewer coils","years","article","METHOD"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that the polymorphism of mRNA could be applied to identifying individuals in mixture samples composed of two body fluids. In this study, we selected 5 blood-specific mRNA biomarkers of venous blood (SPTB, CD3G, AMICA1, ANK1, GYPA) that encompass 16 SNPs to identify the mixture contributor(s). Five specific gene markers for menstrual blood, semen, skin, saliva and vaginal secretions were amplified and typed as body-fluid positive controls. We established the system of multiplex PCR and single base extension reaction (SBE) followed by capillary electrophoresis. The amplicon size was between 90bp-294bp. The peripheral blood specificity was examined against other human body fluids, including saliva, semen, skin, menstrual blood, and vaginal secretion. The 16 SNPs were peripheral blood specific and could be successfully typed in home-made mixtures which are composed of different body fluids with 1ng peripheral blood mRNA added. This system showed a super sensitivity (1:100) in detecting the trace amount of peripheral blood mixed in other body fluids and a combined discrimination power (CDP) of 0.99929 in Chinese population. It was the first time to establish a method of identifying the blood donors and deconvoluting mixtures through detecting mRNA polymorphism with SNaPshot assay. This peripheral blood-specific SNP typing system showed high sensitivity to the typing of blood-source specific markers regardless of other body fluids in the mixture.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading fast and is affecting the clinical workers at much higher risk than the general population. Little is known about COVID-19 effect on pregnant women; however, the emerging evidence suggests they may be at high risk of asymptomatic disease. In light of projected shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), there is an aggressive attempt at conservation. In obstetrics, the guidelines on PPE use are controversial and differ among hospitals, globally, as well as nationally. The centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) recommend using N95 respirators, which are respirators that offer a higher level of protection instead of a facemask for when performing or present for an aerosol-generating procedures (AGP). However, the second stage of labor is not considered an AGP. The second stage of labor can last up to 4 hours. During that time, labor and delivery personnel is in close contact to patients, who are exerting extreme effort during and frequently blow out their breath, cough, shout, and vomit, all of which put the health care team at risk, considering that COVID-19 transmission occurs through aerosol generated by coughing and sneezing. The CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) do not provide clarification on the use of N95 during the second stage. We recommend that labor and delivery personnel have the utmost caution and be granted the protection they need to protect themselves and other patients. This includes providing labor and delivery personnel full PPE including N95 for the second stage of labor. This is critical to ensure the adequate protection for health care workers and to prevent spread to other health care workers and patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Palatnik, Anna; McIntosh, Jennifer J","journal":"American journal of perinatology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1709689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32276282/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs10","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PPE","CDC","AGP","American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["stage of labor","COVID","delivery personnel","health care workers","higher risk","use of N95","N95 respirators","aerosol","patients","PPE use","high risk of asymptomatic disease","health care team","clinical workers","CDC","adequate protection","higher level of protection","disease control","AGP","novel coronavirus disease","spread","light of projected shortage of personal protective equipment","prevention","American College of Obstetricians","pregnant women","close contact","utmost caution","ACOG","Gynecologists","guidelines","cough","shout","emerging evidence","facemask","centers","effect","procedures","obstetrics","general population","clarification","time","providers","aggressive attempt","conservation","breath","vomit","hospitals","extreme effort","transmission","sneezing","hours"],"language":"en"},

Laboratory-based diagnostic tests utilized real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on throat samples. This study evaluated the diagnostic value to analyzing throat and sputum samples in order to improve accuracy and detection efficiency. Methods Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by the RT-PCR assay. Results The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using the RT-PCR assay (p = 0.001). Conclusions The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens were significantly higher than those from throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Chenyao; Xiang, Jie; Yan, Mingzhe; Li, Hongze; Huang, Shuang; Shen, Changxin","journal":"Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301745/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["sputum specimens","specimens of throat swabs","sputum samples","throat samples","nCoV","selection of specimens","RT-PCR assay","detection rates","positive rates","SARS-CoV","detection efficiency","results","higher positive rate","diagnostic tests","diagnostic value","accuracy of diagnosis","real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","viral nucleic acid","order","novel coronavirus","COVID","infected pneumonia","Laboratory","patients","Methods","Wuhan","study","cases","Conclusions","China","RNA","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

The intrinsic risk factors are highly correlated with asthma exacerbation in host, which may be mediated via genetic polymorphisms, enhanced airway epithelial lysis, apoptosis, and exaggerated viral replication in infected cells, resulting in reduced innate immune response and concomitant reduction of interferon (types I, II, and III) synthesis. The canonical features of allergic asthma include strong Th2-related inflammation, sensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), eosinophilia, enhanced levels of Th2 cytokines, goblet cell hyperplasia, airway hyper-responsiveness, and airway remodeling. However, the NSAID-resistant non-Th2 asthma shows a characteristic neutrophilic influx, Th1/Th17 or even mixed (Th17-Th2) immune response and concurrent cytokine streams. Moreover, inhaled corticosteroid-resistant asthma may be associated with multifactorial innate and adaptive responses. In this review, we will discuss the findings of various in vivo and ex vivo models to establish the critical heterogenic asthmatic etiologies, host-pathogen relationships, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, and subsequent mechanisms underlying asthma exacerbation triggered by respiratory viral infections.","publish_time":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hossain, Ferdaus Mohd Altaf; Choi, Jin Young; Uyangaa, Erdenebileg; Park, Seong Ok; Eo, Seong Kug","journal":"Immune network","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2019.19.e31; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31720042/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["III"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["asthma exacerbation","NSAID-resistant non-Th2 asthma","Th17-Th2","heterogeneous nature of asthma","inhaled corticosteroid-resistant asthma","multidimensional immune responses","canonical features of allergic asthma","reduced innate immune response","enhanced levels of Th2 cytokines","airway remodeling","adaptive responses","intrinsic risk factors","strong Th2-related inflammation","enhanced airway epithelial lysis","airway hyper-responsiveness","respiratory viral infections","respiratory viruses","goblet cell hyperplasia","exaggerated viral replication","host-pathogen relationships","non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs","sensitivity","NSAIDs","eosinophilia","apoptosis","characteristic neutrophilic influx","infected cells","concomitant reduction of interferon","critical heterogenic asthmatic etiologies","subsequent mechanisms","specific pathogens","genetic polymorphisms","poor prognosis","chronic diseases","concurrent cytokine streams","complex interplay","types","severity","findings of various","bacteria","review","synthesis"],"language":"en"},

Fragile patients are at high risk of developing complications such as pneumonia and may die from it. Limited information is available on the extent of the circulation of respiratory viruses in the hospital setting. Most knowledge relates to influenza viruses (FLU) but several other viruses produce flu-like illness. The study was conducted at the University Hospital Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. Clinical and laboratory data from hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections during the period October 2016-March 2019 were analysed. The retrospective analysis included 17 viral agents detected by FilmArray test and clinical data from medical records and hospital discharge sheets. Models were adjusted for relevant confounders such as clinical severity and risk of death, socio-demographic characteristics and surgical procedures. From a total of 539 specimens analysed, 180 (33.39%) were positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Among them, 83 (46.1 %) were positive for influenza viruses (FLU), 36 (20%) rhino/enteroviruses (RHV/EV), 17 (9.44%) human coronaviruses (HCOV-229E, -HKU1, -NL63, and -OC43), 17 (9.44%) respiratory syncytial virus, 15 (8.33%) human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 8 (4.44%) parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and 4 (2.22%) adenoviruses (ADV). The distribution of viral agents varied across age groups and month of detection. The positive specimens were from 168 patients [102 M, 66 F; median age (range): 64 years (19-93)]. Overall, 40% of them had a high-grade clinical severity and a 27% risk of death; 27 patients died and 22 of them (81.5%) had received a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. Respiratory viral infections may have a severe course and a poor prognosis in hospitalized patients, due to underlying comorbidities. Monitoring the circulation of respiratory viruses in hospital settings is important to improve diagnosis, prevention and treatment.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ciotti, Marco; Maurici, Massimo; Santoro, Viviana; Coppola, Luigi; Sarmati, Loredana; De Carolis, Gerardo; De Filippis, Patrizia; Pica, Francesca","journal":"Microorganisms","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8040501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32244685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Tor Vergata"],"organizations":["University Hospital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["circulation of respiratory viruses","Respiratory viral infections","parainfluenza viruses","clinical data","hospitalized patients","Respiratory tract infections account","Fragile patients","clinical diagnosis of pneumonia","respiratory syncytial virus","high-grade clinical severity","hospital settings","risk of death","positive specimens","hospital discharge sheets","distribution of viral agents","high risk of developing complications","University Hospital Policlinico Tor Vergata","high morbidity","laboratory data","age groups","median age","human coronaviruses","human metapneumovirus","medical records","FilmArray test","Rome","socio-demographic characteristics","severe course","extent","mortality","poor prognosis","relevant confounders","surgical procedures","Italy","HCOV","range","month of detection","rhino","enteroviruses","RHV","NL63","HKU1","Limited information","prevention","world","retrospective analysis","underlying comorbidities","knowledge","period","Models","HMPV","treatment","years","study","PIV","illness","adenoviruses","ADV","OC43","total"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, a specific newer generation MWA system, The Emprint\u2122 Ablation System with Thermosphere\u2122 Technology, was designed to create predictable large spherical zones of ablation that are not impacted by varying tissue environments. The time required for ablation with MWA systems is short, and the shape of the necrosis is elliptical with the older systems and spherical with the new system. In addition, because MWA has no heat-sink effect, it can be used to ablate tumors adjacent to major vessels. Although these factors yield a large ablation volume and result in good local control, excessive ablation of liver tissue and unexpected ablation of surrounding organs are possible. Therefore, MWA should be carefully performed. This review highlights the efficacy and complications of MWA performed with conventional systems and the newer generation system in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MWA with the newer generation system seems to be a promising treatment option for large HCCs and secondary hepatic malignancies, with several advantages over other available ablation techniques, including conventional MWA. However, further randomized controlled trials are necessary to fully clarify the benefits and pitfalls of this new system.","publish_time":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Imajo, Kento; Ogawa, Yuji; Yoneda, Masato; Saito, Satoru; Nakajima, Atsushi","journal":"Journal of medical ultrasonics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10396-019-00997-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31960190/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MWA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ablation System","microwave ablation","complications of MWA","specific newer generation MWA system","large ablation volume","newer generation system","new system","major limitation of conventional MWA systems","available ablation techniques","ablation zone size","conventional systems","excessive ablation of liver tissue","predictable large spherical zones of ablation","unexpected ablation of surrounding organs","older systems","large HCCs","shape","major vessels","varying tissue environments","good local control","result","Emprint","secondary hepatic malignancies","advantages","promising treatment option","patients","lack of predictability","high thermal efficiency","hepatocellular carcinoma","necrosis","benefits","Technology","Thermosphere","tumors adjacent","heat","efficacy","pitfalls","factors","time","controlled trials","review","addition","effect"],"language":"en"},

Vascular reactivity experiments were done on circumflex coronary artery of goats using the tension experiments. Goat coronary arterial rings were relaxed with biochanin-A in concentration (0.1-100 \u03BCM)-dependent manner. Endothelium had no effect on biochanin-A-induced relaxation.

In March, it introduced further measures to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), placing the country in a state of almost complete lockdown. We report the impact of these restrictions on glucose control among people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS Data were collected on 33 individuals with T1D who were monitoring their glucose levels using a flash glucose monitoring device and remotely connected to the diabetes clinic on a cloud platform. We retrieved information on average glucose, standard deviation and percentage time in hypoglycaemia (\u003C 70 mg/dl), glucose range (70-180 mg/dl) and hyperglycaemia (\u003E 180 mg/dl). We compared glycaemic measures collected during lockdown to those collected before the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and to the periods immediately before lockdown. RESULTS In 20 patients who had stopped working and were at home as a result of the lockdown, overall glycaemic control improved during the first 7 days of the lockdown as compared to the weeks before the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Average glucose declined from 177 \u00B1 45 mg/dl (week before lockdown) to 160 \u00B1 40 mg/dl (lockdown; p = 0.005) and the standard deviation improved significantly. Time in range increased from 54.4 to 65.2% (p = 0.010), and time in hyperglycaemia decreased from 42.3 to 31.6% (p = 0.016). The number of scans per day remained unchanged. In 13 patients who continued working, none of the measures of glycaemic control changed during lockdown. CONCLUSION Despite the limited possibility to exercise and the incumbent psychologic stress, glycaemic control improved in patients with T1D who stopped working during the lockdown, suggesting that slowing down routine daily activities can have beneficial effects on T1D management, at least in the short term.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonora, Benedetta Maria; Boscari, Federico; Avogaro, Angelo; Bruttomesso, Daniela; Fadini, Gian Paolo","journal":"Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13300-020-00829-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394184/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["glucose control","complete lockdown","average glucose","glucose range","measures of glycaemic control","glucose levels","glycaemic measures","spread of SARS","SARS-CoV","patients","T1D management","flash glucose monitoring device","spread of coronavirus disease","standard deviation","percentage time","hyperglycaemia","spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","diabetes clinic","sport activities","routine daily activities","beneficial effects","people","incumbent psychologic stress","type","hypoglycaemia","restrictions","information","limited possibility","number of scans","Italian Government","cloud platform","individuals","COVID","state","epidemic","impact","weeks","short term","METHODS Data","CONCLUSION","country","periods","home","days","INTRODUCTION","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

There are few options for pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of propofol for children under two years old. We performed an external validation of the Kim model for children under two years old to evaluate whether the model is applicable to this age group. METHODS Twenty-four children were enrolled. After routine anesthetic induction, a continuous infusion of 2% propofol and remifentanil was commenced using the Kim model. The target effect-site concentration of propofol was set as 2, 3, 4, and 5 \u03BCg/mL, followed by arterial blood sampling after 10 min of each equilibrium. Population estimates of four parameters-pooled bias, inaccuracy, divergence, and wobble-were used to evaluate the performance of the Kim model. RESULTS A total of 95 plasma concentrations were used for evaluation of the Kim model. The population estimate (95% confidence interval) of bias was -0.96% (-8.45%, 6.54%) and that of inaccuracy was 21.0% (15.0%-27.0%) for the plasma concentration of propofol. CONCLUSION The pooled bias and inaccuracy of the pharmacokinetic predictions are clinically acceptable. Therefore, our external validation of the Kim model indicated that the model can be applicable to target-controlled infusion of propofol in children younger than 2 years, with the recommended use of actual bispectral index monitoring in clinical settings that remifentanil is present.

Our aim was to review the most current data on COVID-19 to provide essential suggestions on how to manage the acute abdomen during the pandemic. METHODS A systematic review was conducted of the most relevant English language articles on COVID-19 and surgery published between 15 December 2019 and 30 March 2020. FINDINGS Access to the operating theatre is almost exclusively restricted to emergencies and oncological procedures. The use of laparoscopy in COVID-19 positive patients should be cautiously considered. The main risk lies in the presence of the virus in the pneumoperitoneum: the aerosol released in the operating theatre could contaminate both staff and the environment. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, all efforts should be deployed in order to evaluate the feasibility of postponing surgery until the patient is no longer considered potentially infectious or at risk of perioperative complications. If surgery is deemed necessary, the emergency surgeon must minimise the risk of exposure to the virus by involving a minimal number of healthcare staff and shortening the occupation of the operating theatre. In case of a lack of security measures to enable safe laparoscopy, open surgery should be considered.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"De Simone, B; Chouillard, E; Di Saverio, S; Pagani, L; Sartelli, M; Biffl, W L; Coccolini, F; Pieri, A; Khan, M; Borzellino, G; Campanile, F C; Ansaloni, L; Catena, F","journal":"Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.0097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352836/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjszMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","operating theatre","open surgery","trauma surgery","pandemic","feasibility of postponing surgery","virus","risk of exposure","main risk","risk of perioperative complications","safe laparoscopy","use of laparoscopy","emergency surgeon","systematic review","relevant English language articles","minimal number of healthcare staff","lack of security measures","presence","aerosol","occupation","reorganisation of surgical activity","order","case","pneumoperitoneum","emergencies","FINDINGS Access","positive patients","efforts","acute abdomen","current data","essential suggestions","oncological procedures","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","aim","environment","INTRODUCTION","impact"],"language":"en"},

Being ubiquitously and increasingly present over the past 60 years, they provide various benefits to the global economy. However, inappropriate and/or uncontrolled disposal practices, poor waste management infrastructure, and application of insufficient recycling technologies, coupled with a lack of public awareness and incentives, have rendered plastic waste (PW) omnipresent, littering both the marine and the terrestrial environment with multifaceted impacts. The plastic marine litter issue has received much attention, especially in the past decade. There is a plethora of articles and reports released on an annual basis, as well as a lot of ongoing research, which render the issue either to be overexposured or misconstrued.

Surgical volume and clinic visits are curtailed, personal protective equipment for operating room participation is restricted, and the risk of COVID-19 disease transmission during heretofore routine patient care is the new norm. METHODS We describe a small-team \u0022cohorting\u0022 protocol including guidelines for faculty and resident in common clinical scenarios with attention paid to the risk of common otolaryngologic procedures. RESULTS A rotating small-team approach was implemented at each clinical site, limiting interaction between Department members but providing comprehensive coverage. Faculty were involved at the earliest phase of clinical interactions. Guidelines delineated faculty and resident roles based on risk stratification by patient COVID status and anticipated procedures. Special consideration was given to high-risk procedures such as endoscopy and tracheotomy. CONCLUSIONS A small-team based approach with guidelines for faculty/resident roles may mitigate risk while optimizing patient care and maximizing education. This article is protected by copyright.

While environmentally relevant microbes often are not amenable to genetic manipulation or cannot be cultivated in the laboratory, extensive metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets for these organisms might be available. Hence, dedicated workflows for specific analyses are needed to fully benefit from this information. Here, we identified abundant sRNAs from oceanic environmental populations of the ecologically important primary producer Prochlorococcus starting from a metatranscriptomic differential RNA-Seq (mdRNA-Seq) dataset. We tracked their homologs in laboratory isolates, and we provide a framework for their further detailed characterization. Several of the experimentally validated sRNAs responded to ecologically relevant changes in cultivation conditions. The expression of the here newly discovered sRNA Yfr28 was highly stimulated in low-nitrogen conditions. Its predicted top targets include mRNAs encoding cell division proteins, a sigma factor, and several enzymes and transporters, suggesting a pivotal role of Yfr28 in the coordination of primary metabolism and cell division. A cis-encoded antisense RNA was identified as a possible positive regulator of atpF encoding subunit b\u0027 of the ATP synthase complex. The presented workflow will also be useful for other environmentally relevant microorganisms for which experimental validation abilities are frequently limiting although there is wealth of sequence information available.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lott, Steffen C; Voigt, Karsten; Lambrecht, S Joke; Hess, Wolfgang R; Steglich, Claudia","journal":"The ISME journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-0658-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346084/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs0MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antisense RNAs","relevant microorganisms","relevant changes","relevant microbes","metatranscriptomic differential RNA-Seq","cell division proteins","important roles","metatranscriptomic datasets","important primary producer Prochlorococcus","mdRNA-Seq","abundant sRNAs","validated sRNAs","laboratory isolates","cultivation conditions","natural populations","wealth of sequence information available","coordination of primary metabolism","Small regulatory RNAs","oceanic environmental populations","pivotal role of Yfr28","discovered sRNA Yfr28","regulation of gene expression","low-nitrogen conditions","subunit b","possible positive regulator of atpF","sigma factor","targets","mRNAs","extensive metagenomic","transporters","enzymes","experimental validation abilities","ATP synthase complex","framework","dedicated workflows","specific analyses","bacteria","genetic manipulation","detailed characterization","presented workflow","homologs"],"language":"en"},

MATERIAL AND METHODS We reviewed clinical data from the first 60 pregnant women with COVID-19 whose care was managed at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital, Madrid, Spain from March 14th to April 14th , 2020. Demographic data, clinical findings, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, and outcomes were collected. An analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) was performed to compare the medians of laboratory parameters. Fisher\u0027s exact test was used to evaluate categorical variables. A correspondence analysis was used to explore associations between variables. RESULTS A total of 60 pregnant women were diagnosed with COVID-19. The most common symptoms were fever and cough (75.5%, each) followed by dyspnea (37.8%). Forty-one patients (68.6%) required hospital admission (18 due to disease worsening and 23 for delivery) of whom 21 patients (35%) underwent pharmacological treatment, including hydroxychloroquine, antivirals, antibiotics and tocilizumab. No renal or cardiac failures or maternal deaths were reported. Lymphopenia (50%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (59%) were observed in the early stages of the disease. Median CRP, D-dimer and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were elevated. High CRP and D-dimer levels were the parameters most frequently associated with severe pneumonia. The Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was found to be the most sensitive marker for disease improvement (relative risk: 6.65; 95% CI: 4.1-5.9). During the study period, 18 of the women (78%) delivered vaginally. All newborns tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and none of them were infected during breastfeeding. No SARS-CoV-2 was detected in placental tissue. CONCLUSIONS Most of the pregnant COVID-19 positive patients had a favorable clinical course. However, one-third of them developed pneumonia, of whom 5% presented a critical clinical status. CRP and D-dimer levels positively correlated with severe pneumonia and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio decreased as the patients improved clinically. Seventy-eight percent of patients had a vaginal delivery. No vertical or horizontal transmissions were diagnosed in the neonates during labor or breastfeeding.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pereira, Augusto; Cruz-Melguizo, Sara; Adrien, Maria; Fuentes, Lucia; Marin, Eugenia; Perez-Medina, Tirso","journal":"Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.13921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32441332/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fisher","Lymphopenia"],"organizations":["Puerta de Hierro University Hospital"],"locations":["Madrid","Spain"],"keyphrases":["pregnant COVID","clinical findings","clinical data","management of pregnant women","clinical experience","Coronavirus disease","severe pneumonia","positive patients","neutrophil","lymphocyte ratio","SARS-CoV","percent of patients","D-dimer levels","disease improvement","disease worsening","High CRP","Median CRP","laboratory test results","favorable clinical course","critical clinical status","breastfeeding","Kruskal-Wallis test","Fisher\u0027s exact test","medians of laboratory parameters","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus","imaging findings","Demographic data","pharmacological treatment","hospital admission","analysis of variance","vaginal delivery","study period","correspondence analysis","categorical variables","Hierro University Hospital","elevated C-reactive protein","hydroxychloroquine","antivirals","Madrid","Puerta","relative risk","sensitive marker","cardiac failures","maternal deaths","neonates","Spain","care","common symptoms","fever","cough","horizontal transmissions","antibiotics","tocilizumab","associations","newborns","MATERIAL","METHODS","days","INTRODUCTION","aim","early stages","outcomes","pandemic","CONCLUSIONS","total","placental tissue","Lymphopenia","thrombocytopenia","dyspnea"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to outline the main issues that led tobacco smoking being discussed as a potential risk factor associated with COVID-19. METHODS articles from MEDLINE and pre-prints published from January to April 2020 were identified. RESULTS data from China showed that men had more severe outcomes of COVID-19 than women. Since smoking prevalence is very high among Chinese men in comparison to women, it was hypothesized that smoking could be a risk factor for poor prognosis. This was also supported by the higher prevalence of comorbidities, many of which are tobacco-related diseases, in patients with severe COVID-19, who were also more likely to have a smoking history. A meta-analysis confirmed these results reporting an OR=2.25 (95% CI: 1.49-3.39) for developing severe Covid-19 among patients with a smoking history. Some authors, noticing that reported smoking prevalence among hospitalized patients was substantially below smoking prevalence in the corresponding populations, speculated a protective role of nicotine. However, it is likely that low prevalence among hospitalized patients are partially due to many smokers misclassified as nonsmokers. Tobacco smoking seems to cause a dose-dependent upregulation of the angiotensin-converting- enzyme-2 (ACE2), the virus cellular entry receptor, which could explain the higher risk of severe COVID-19 in smokers. CONCLUSIONS There is need for further independent studies to clarify the role of smoking on COVID-19 incidence, progression and mortality.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cattaruzza, Maria Sofia; Zag\u00E0, Vincenzo; Gallus, Silvano; D\u0027Argenio, Paolo; Gorini, Giuseppe","journal":"Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i2.9698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420934/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["smoking prevalence","tobacco smoking","role of smoking","smoking history","severe outcomes of COVID","higher risk of severe COVID","INTRODUCTION COVID","hospitalized patients","low prevalence","higher prevalence of comorbidities","potential risk factor","women","tobacco-related diseases","Chinese men","RESULTS data","protective role of nicotine","international scene","pandemic burst","ACE2","angiotensin","virus cellular entry receptor","comparison","new disease","corresponding populations","China","main issues","incidence","dose-dependent upregulation","METHODS articles","MEDLINE","pre-prints","study","independent studies","progression","poor prognosis","enzyme","mortality","meta-analysis","authors","aim","CONCLUSIONS","nonsmokers","questions"],"language":"en"},

Gynecology is a specialty department with a large number of critical and severe patients. Consequently, it is of preeminent importance to formulate the in-patient management process. Rearranging the gynecological wards and managing ward partition, as well as the medical protection measures in specialized areas, are suitable for the current prevention and control for COVID-19 pandemic and the therapeutic requirements of patients. To effectively minimize nosocomial infections during the COVID- 19 pandemic period, our department implemented a novel prevention strategy based on the ward redesign and partition management. With this model, our department effectively protected the safety and health of patients and medical care staff from cross and nosocomial infection in the hospital. Now we would like to share the experience and strategies we implemented as following.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jin; Yang, Jiang; Li, Suting; Chen, Jue; Yang, Lian; Zhao, Zhihan; Hong, Li","journal":"Panminerva medica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23736/s0031-0808.20.03938-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414230/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs1OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["deaths","severe patients","health of patients","specialty department","ward partition","partition management","outbreak of COVID","confirmed cases","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","therapeutic requirements of patients","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","current prevention","ward redesign","pandemic period","nosocomial infections","medical care staff","medical protection measures","novel prevention strategy","in-patient management process","large number of critical","specialized areas","control","MERS","SARS","safety","preeminent importance","hospital","gynecological wards","Gynecology","experience","strategies","model"],"language":"en"},

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is radically altering both socio-economic and health care scenarios. METHODS On April 4, 2020, at 13.30 CET, a webinar was broadcasted, organized by Global Neuro and supported by WFNS. Expert neurosurgeons from 6 different countries (China, Italy, South Korea, USA, Colombia and United Kingdom) reported on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their health care systems and neurosurgical activity. RESULTS The first part focused on the epidemiology until that date. The USA were the most affected State with 450.000 cases, followed by Italy (140.000 cases and 19.000 casualties), China (83.305 cases and 3.345 had died), South Korea (10.156 cases with 177 casualties), the UK (38.168 cases and 3.605 deaths) and Colombia (1.267 cases and 25 deaths). The second part concerned Institution and staff reorganization. In every country all surgical plans have been modified. In Wuhan the staff was enrolled in COVID-units. In New York, the Mount Sinai Health System was in lockdown mode. In South Korea, sterilizing chambers have been placed. In Italy some Departments were reorganized in a Hub and Spoke fashion. In the Latin American region, they adopted special measures for every case. In the UK a conference center has been used to accommodate intensive care unit (ICU) beds. The third part was about neurosurgical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Wuhan the main hospital was used for urgent non-COVID patients. In New York the neurosurgeon staff work in ICU as advanced practitioner (APP). In South Korea every patient is screened. In Italy the on-duty Hub neurosurgeons have been doubled. In the Latin American region recommendations have been developed by some neurosurgical societies. In the UK local non-specialists and traumatologists neurosurgical experts are collaborating in terms of best practice. The final part touched upon how to perform safe surgery and re-start after the pandemic. In China elective surgical procedures are performed very carefully. In New York, surgery planning will be based on patient\u0027s viral load. In South Korea and in Italy disinfection plans and negative-pressure O.R. were created. In the Latin American region, the aim is to have a rapid testing system. In the UK they have developed flowcharts to guide trauma patient management. CONCLUSIONS In general, the pandemic scenario was presented as a thought-provoking challenge in all countries which requires tireless efforts for both maintaining emergency and elective neurosurgical procedures.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fontanella, Marco M; Saraceno, Giorgio; Lei, Ting; Bederson, Joshua B; You, Namkyu; Rubiano, Andres M; Hutchinson, Peter; Wiemeijer-Timmer, Fr\u00E9d\u00E9rique; Servadei, Franco","journal":"Journal of neurosurgical sciences","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23736/s0390-5616.20.04994-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs3MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Neuro","USA","UK","Mount Sinai Health System","ICU"],"locations":["Colombia","Wuhan","New York","South Korea","China"],"keyphrases":["cases","South Korea","neurosurgical practice","pandemic scenario","neurosurgical activity","New York","elective neurosurgical procedures","neurosurgical societies","COVID-units","ongoing COVID","casualties","Italy disinfection plans","Latin American region recommendations","health care systems","traumatologists neurosurgical experts","health care scenarios","urgent non-COVID patients","China elective surgical procedures","ICU","Colombia","UK local non-specialists","neurosurgeon staff","USA","staff reorganization","surgical plans","deaths","Wuhan","Mount Sinai Health System","intensive care unit","duty Hub neurosurgeons","different countries","surgery planning","safe surgery","Expert neurosurgeons","rapid testing system","terms of best practice","trauma patient management","emergency","aim","advanced practitioner","lockdown mode","main hospital","United Kingdom","special measures","tireless efforts","thought-provoking challenge","beds","flowcharts","re-start","negative-pressure","impact","patient\u0027s viral load","APP","CONCLUSIONS","affected State","sterilizing chambers","Global Neuro","conference center","webinar","WFNS","Institution","country","Departments","half people","epidemiology","date","CET","fashion","BACKGROUND","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

People with diabetes and related comorbidities are at increased risk of its complications and of COVID-19-related death. Older age, multi-morbidity, hyperglycaemia, cardiac injury and severe inflammatory response are predictors of poor outcome. The complex interplay between COVID-19, diabetes and the effects of related therapies is being explored. Most patients experience a mild illness with COVID-19, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease. Optimising glycaemic control and adopting measures to prevent disease spread are critical aspects. The management of mild disease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment of severe disease. Several of these agents have specific considerations for use in people with diabetes. Since mass population lockdowns are considered a key step in controlling disease spread, it follows that, in addition to the direct vulnerability to severe COVID-19, people with diabetes can be affected by limited access to healthcare, insulin, other medications and blood glucose monitoring equipment. Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored. People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems. Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic.

In this study, the neuro-mechanical analysis of leg cycling was used to longitudinally investigate the motor recovery process coupled with cycling training augmented by Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) in subacute stroke survivors. METHODS Subjects with ischemic subacute stroke participated in a 3-week training of FES-cycling with visual biofeedback plus usual care. Participants were evaluated before and after the intervention through clinical scales, gait spatio-temporal parameters derived from an instrumented mat, and a voluntary pedaling test. Biomechanical metrics (work produced by the two legs, mechanical effectiveness and symmetry indexes) and bilateral electromyography from 9 leg muscles were acquired during the voluntary pedaling test. To extract muscles synergies, the Weighted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization algorithm was applied to the normalized EMG envelopes. Synergy complexity was measured by the number of synergies required to explain more than 90% of the total variance of the normalized EMG envelopes and variance accounted for by one synergy. Regardless the inter-subject differences in the number of extracted synergies, 4 synergies were extracted from each patient and the cosine-similarity between patients and healthy weight vectors was computed. RESULTS Nine patients (median age of 75 years and median time post-stroke of 2 weeks) were recruited. Significant improvements in terms of clinical scales, gait parameters and work produced by the affected leg were obtained after training. Synergy complexity well correlated to the level of motor impairment at baseline, but it did not change after training. We found a significant improvement in the similarity of the synergy responsible of the knee flexion during the pulling phase of the pedaling cycle, which was the mostly compromised at baseline. This improvement may indicate the re-learning of a more physiological motor strategy. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the use of the neuro-mechanical analysis of cycling as a method to assess motor recovery after stroke, mainly in an early phase, when gait evaluation is not yet possible.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise-based muscle injury prevention strategies in adult elite football. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscuss (EBSCO). We considered only elite adult (\u003E 16 year-old) football players with no distinction for gender; the intervention to be any exercise/s performed with the target to prevent lower-limb muscle injuries; the comparison to be no injury prevention exercise undertaken; the outcome to be the number of injuries, injury incidence, and severity. We searched systematic reviews, randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), and non-randomized-controlled trials (NRCTs), limited for English language. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews tool, the Cochrane Collaboration\u0027s Tool for assessing risk of bias in RCTs, and the Risk of Bias in NRCTs of Interventions tool. RESULTS 15 studies were included. Three systematic reviews showed inconsistent results, with one supporting (high risk of bias) and two showing insufficient evidence (low risk of bias) to support exercise-based strategies to prevent muscle injuries in elite players. Five RCTs and seven NRCTs support eccentric exercise, proprioception exercises, and a multi-dimensional component to an injury prevention program; however, all were deemed to be at high/critical risk of bias. Only one RCT was found at low risk of bias and supported eccentric exercise for preventing groin problems. CONCLUSION We found limited scientific evidence to support exercise-based strategies to prevent muscle injury in elite footballers.

However, from the viewpoint of decision makers, due to lower external validity, practical results of efficacy research are often not in line with the huge investments made over decades. METHOD We conducted a narrative review. With a special focus on homeopathy, we give an overview on cohort, comparative cohort, case-control and cross-sectional study designs and explain guidelines and tools that help to improve the quality of observational studies, such as the STROBE Statement, RECORD, GRACE and ENCePP Guide. RESULTS Within the conventional medical research field, two types of arguments have been employed in favor of observational studies. First, observational studies allow for a more generalizable and robust estimation of effects in clinical practice, and if cohorts are large enough, there is no over-estimation of effect sizes, as is often feared. We argue that observational research is needed to balance the current over-emphasis on internal validity at the expense of external validity. Thus, observational research can be considered an important research tool to describe \u0022real-world\u0022 care settings and can assist with the design and inform the results of randomised controlled trails.

The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the entire globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)has infected more than two million people worldwide, causing over 160,000 deaths. Patients with COVID-19 disease present with a wide array of symptoms, ranging from mild flu-like complaints to life threatening pulmonary and cardiac complications. Older people and patients with underlying disease have an increased risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Once intubated, mortality increases exponentially. A number of pharmacologic regimens, including hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin, antiviral therapy (eg, remdesevir), and anti-IL-6 agents (e.g., toclizumab), have been highlighted by investigators over the course of the pandemic, based on the therapy\u0027s potential to interrupt the viral life-cycle of SARS-CoV-2 or preventing cytokine storm. At present, there have been no conclusive series of reproducible randomised clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of any one drug or therapy for COVID-19. CASES COVID-19 positive patients (n=5) at a single institution received hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) between 13 and 20 April 2020. All the patients had tachypnoea and low oxygen saturation despite receiving high FiO2. HBOT was added to prevent the need for mechanical ventilation. A standard dive profile of 2.0ATA for 90 minutes was employed. Patients received between one and six treatments in one of two dedicated monoplace hyperbaric chambers. RESULTS All the patients recovered without the need for mechanical ventilation. Following HBOT, oxygen saturation increased, tachypnoea resolved and inflammatory markers fell. At the time of writing, three of the five patients have been discharged from the hospital and two remain in stable condition. CONCLUSION This small sample of patients exhibited dramatic improvement with HBOT. Most importantly, HBOT potentially prevented the need for mechanical ventilation. Larger studies are likely to define the role of HBOT in the treatment of this novel disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thibodeaux, Kerry; Speyrer, Marcus; Raza, Amer; Yaakov, Raphael; Serena, Thomas E","journal":"Journal of wound care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12968/jowc.2020.29.sup5a.s4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412891/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs4Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","HBOT"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["positive patients","mechanical ventilation","role of HBOT","small sample of patients","need","hyperbaric oxygen therapy","disease present","novel disease","CASES COVID","low oxygen saturation","underlying disease","tachypnoea","contagious SARS-CoV","antiviral therapy","pandemic","entire world","increased risk","Older people","novel Coronavirus","entire globe","life threatening pulmonary","viral life-cycle","World Health Organization","dedicated monoplace hyperbaric chambers","severe acute respiratory syndrome","complaints","efficacy","conclusive series of reproducible randomised clinical trials","hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin","mild flu","dramatic improvement","single institution","wide array of symptoms","cardiac complications","ATA","Wuhan","remdesevir","therapy\u0027s potential","high FiO2","number of pharmacologic regimens","standard dive profile","agents","anti-IL","China","hospital","treatments","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVE","drug","Larger studies","inflammatory markers","stable condition","minutes","investigators","course","cytokine storm","time of writing","toclizumab","deaths","mortality"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of TCZ therapy in COVID-19 infected patients. METHODS The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 before and after TCZ therapy, and clinical outcome in the 15 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS Totally 15 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. 2 of them were moderately ill, 6 were seriously ill and 7 were critically ill. The TCZ was used in combination with methylprednisolone (MP) in 8 patients. 5 patients received the TCZ administration twice or more. Although TCZ treatment ameliorated the increased CRP in all patients rapidly, for the 4 critically ill patients who received only single dose of TCZ, 3 of them (No. 1, 2, and 3) still dead and the CRP level in the rest 1 patient (No. 7) failed to return to normal range with a clinical outcome of disease aggravation. Serum IL-6 level tended to further spiked firstly and then decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients. A persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 was observed in these 4 patients who failed treatment. CONCLUSION TCZ appears to be an effective treatment option in COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms. And for these critically ill patients with elevated IL-6, repeated dose of the TCZ is recommended. This article is protected by copyright.

The patient was hemodynamically stable and was found to have an elevated troponin with electrocardiogram showing no ischemic changes. Computed tomography of the coronary arteries showed a left dominant system with dissection extending from the mid-to-distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient was subsequently discharged on medical therapy but returned 3 days later due to worsening chest pain. Electrocardiogram revealed inferior and anteroseptal ST segment changes with peak troponin of 14.9 ng/ml (reference range \u003C0.80 ng/ml). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) nasopharyngeal swab was performed prior to urgent coronary angiogram. Coronary angiogram was performed with full personal protective equipment for respiratory and droplet precautions due to pending COVID-19 testing results. Angiogram revealed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) extending from the ostium of the LAD to the distal vessel. COVID-19 testing returned positive while in intensive care unit.

Stress detection using physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), skin conductance (SC), electromyogram (EMG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) is a traditional approach. However, the effect of stress on the EMG signal of different muscles and the efficacy of combination of the EMG and other biological signals for stress detection have not been taken into account yet. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the EMG signal of the right and left trapezius and right and left erector spinae muscles for multi-level stress recognition. Also, the ECG signal was employed to evaluate the efficacy of EMG signals for stress detection. METHODS Both EMG and ECG signals were acquired simultaneously from 34 healthy students (23 females and 11 males, aged 20-37 years). Mental arithmetic, Stroop color-word test, time pressure, and stressful environment were employed to induce stress in the laboratory. RESULTS The accuracies of stress recognition in two, three and four levels were 100%, 97.6%, and 96.2%, respectively, obtained from the distinct combination of feature selection and machine learning algorithms. CONCLUSIONS The comparison of stress detection accuracies resulted from EMG and ECG indicators demonstrated the strong ability and the effectiveness of EMG signal for multi-level stress detection.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pourmohammadi, Sara; Maleki, Ali","journal":"Computer methods and programs in biomedicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408236/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EMG","ECG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effect of stress","multi-level stress detection","efficacy of EMG signals","accuracies of stress recognition","comparison of stress detection accuracies","effectiveness of EMG signal","multi-level stress recognition","ECG signals","EMG signal of different muscles","physiological signals","biological signals","ECG indicators","efficacy of combination","right","left erector spinae muscles","left trapezius","mental health","Mental arithmetic","recent years","distinct combination of feature selection","Stroop color-word test","time pressure","electrocardiogram","strong ability","machine learning algorithms","skin conductance","electromyogram","stressful environment","EEG","electroencephalogram","OBJECTIVE","comprehensive review","CONCLUSIONS","females","important worldwide concerns","healthy students","BACKGROUND","METHODS","traditional approach","paper","account","laboratory","levels"],"language":"en"},

METHODS In this retrospective, single center cohort study, we included all adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted to a Neuro-COVID Unit from February 21, 2020, who had been discharged or died by April 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (FDR-corrected) to those of neurologic patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period. RESULTS One hundred seventy-three patients were included in this study, of whom 56 were positive for COVID-19 while 117 were negative for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were older (77.0, IQR 67.0-83.8 vs 70.1, IQR 52.9-78.6, p = 0.006), had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders (n = 43, 76.8% vs n = 68, 58.1%), and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (0.5, IQR 0.4-0.6 vs 0.9, IQR 0.7-1.1, p = 0.006). In-hospital mortality rates (n = 21, 37.5% vs n = 5, 4.3%, p \u003C 0.001) and incident delirium (n = 15, 26.8% vs n = 9, 7.7%, p = 0.003) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group. COVID-19 and non-COVID patients with stroke had similar baseline characteristics but patients with COVID-19 had higher modified Rankin scale scores at discharge (5.0, IQR 2.0-6.0 vs 2.0, IQR 1.0-3.0, p \u003C 0.001), with a significantly lower number of patients with a good outcome (n = 11, 25.6% vs n = 48, 70.6%, p \u003C 0.001). In patients with COVID-19, multivariable regressions showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with higher qSOFA scores (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.21-16.5; p = 0.025), lower platelet count (0.98, 0.97-0.99; p = 0.005) and higher lactate dehydrogenase (1.01, 1.00-1.03; p = 0.009) on admission.

METHODS All 25 children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RNA-PCR) were admitted from the 4 designated treatment hospitals of 2019-nCoV in Chongqing from January 19 to March 12, 2020. Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS The diagnosis was confirmed through RNA-PCR testing. Among the 25 cases, 14 were males and 11 were females. The median age was 11.0 (6.3-14.5) years (range 0.6-17.0 years). All children were related to a family cluster outbreak, and 7 children (28%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 8 (32%) asymptomatic, 4 (16%) very mild cases and 13 (52%) common cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The most common symptoms were cough (13 cases, 52%) and fever (6 cases, 24%). The duration time of clinical symptoms was 13.0 (8.0-25.0) days. In the 25 cases, on admission, 21 cases (84%) had normal white blood cell counts, while only 2 cases (8%) more than 10 \u00D7 10/L and 2 cases (8%) less than 4 \u00D7 10/L, respectively; 22 cases(88%) had normal CD4\u002B T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 3 cases(8%) this increased mildly; 23 cases had normal CD8\u002B T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 2 cases (8%) CD8\u002B T lymphocyte counts were mildly increased as well. All Lymphocyte counts were normal. There were no statistical differences of lab results between the groups of asymptomatic cases, mild cases and common cases. There were only 13 cases with abnormal CT imaging, most of which were located in the subpleural area of the bottom of the lung. All patients were treated with interferon, 6 cases combined with Ribavirin, and 12 cases combined with lopinavir or ritonavir. The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 \u00B1 6.54 days. There was no significant difference of RNA turning negative between the groups of interferon, interferon plus ribavirin and interferon plus lopinavir or ritonavir treatment. All the cases recovered and were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSIONS The morbidity of 2019-nCoV infection in children is lower than in adults and the clinical manifestations and inflammatory biomarkers in children are nonspecific and milder than that in adults. RNA-PCR test is still the most reliable diagnostic method, especially for asymptomatic patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bai, Ke; Liu, Wenjun; Liu, Chengjun; Fu, Yueqiang; Hu, Jun; Qin, Yanran; Zhang, Qiaoying; Chen, Hongyan; Xu, Feng; Li, Changda","journal":"The Pediatric infectious disease journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404786/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI1LmNzdjs5NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1248575,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"p8iumfu8an25QXG89nUo3w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_25.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Chongqing"],"keyphrases":["common cases","mild cases","critical cases","groups of asymptomatic cases","T lymphocyte counts","nCoV infection","characteristics of clinical manifestations of children","asymptomatic patients","RNA-PCR testing","groups of interferon","normal CD8","Clinical data","days","normal CD4","common symptoms","normal white blood cell counts","different clinical types","significant difference of RNA","duration time of clinical symptoms","Ribavirin","adults","lopinavir","ritonavir treatment","years","Chongqing","real-time reverse transcription-PCR","residence history","epidemiological history","designated treatment hospitals","statistical differences of lab results","inflammatory biomarkers","novel coronavirus","reliable diagnostic method","travel","Hubei Province","laboratory","family cluster outbreak","abnormal CT imaging","morbidity","onset","cough","range","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","diagnosis","fever","admission","subpleural area","median age","lung","females"],"language":"en"},

Studies have shown that this virus causes worse outcomes and a higher mortality rate in older adults and those with comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and chronic kidney disease. A significant percentage of older American adults have these diseases, putting them at a higher risk of infection. Additionally, many adults with hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease are placed on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Studies have shown that these medications upregulate the ACE-2 receptor, the very receptor which the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to enter host cells, which puts older adults at a further increased risk of infection. In this review, we discuss the transmission, symptomatology, mortality, and possible treatments for this infection, as they relate to older adults. This article is protected by copyright.

Indocyanine green near-infrared video angiography (ICG-NIR-VA) has been adopted for objective assessment of free flap tissue perfusion but is thus far not used on a routine basis. Therefore, we investigated its intraoperative impact on decision-making and postoperative outcome. METHODS From January 2017 to June 2019, 88 consecutive adipo- or fasciocutaneus free flaps were performed in conjunction with intraoperative ICG-NIR-VA. Free flap tissue perfusion was first assessed clinically and then compared with ICG-NIR-VA findings. Based on the results, the decision for intraoperative trimming of critically perfused flap zones was made. The way of decision-making, flap success, and failure rates as well as intra- and postoperative complication rates were analyzed. RESULTS The overall free flap success rate was 92.0%. Partial flap necrosis occurred in five cases (5.7%) and total flap necrosis in two cases (2.3%). ICG-NIR-VA aided decision-making and flap design in 34 cases (38.6%) and led to complication-free postoperative courses. When ICG-NIR-VA was relied on (82 out of 88 flaps; 93.2%), there was no unpredicted postoperative tissue necrosis (overestimation). When ICG-NIR-VA was not relied on (6 out of 88 flaps; 6.8%), there were five cases of postoperative partial flap necrosis and one case of uneventful healing (underestimation). The sensitivity of ICG-NIR-VA was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64.6-100) and the specificity was 98.8% (95% CI: 93.3-100) with a positive predictive value of 87.5% (95% CI: 52.9-99.4) and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 95.4-100). CONCLUSION Intraoperative ICG-NIR-VA objectified free flap perfusion and thus refined surgical decision-making on flap design in all cases. It could always predict tissue necrosis and subjectively improved outcomes in free flap surgery at our institution. Furthermore, it could be easily implemented in intraoperative routine, only adding minimal additional operative time.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bigdeli, Amir Khosrow; Thomas, Benjamin; Falkner, Florian; Gazyakan, Emre; Hirche, Christoph; Kneser, Ulrich","journal":"Journal of reconstructive microsurgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1710552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408364/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Indocyanine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["free flap perfusion","NIR-VA","free flap surgery","flap design","total flap necrosis","cases of postoperative partial flap necrosis","CONCLUSION Intraoperative ICG-NIR","objective assessment of free flap tissue perfusion","overall free flap success rate","perfused flap zones","sensitivity of ICG","fasciocutaneus free flaps","complication-free postoperative courses","VA aided decision-making","VA findings","unpredicted postoperative tissue necrosis","distal portions of free flaps","intraoperative routine","intraoperative trimming","intraoperative impact","postoperative outcome","postoperative complication rates","surgical decision-making","way of decision-making","BACKGROUND Reliable perfusion","reconstructive success","results","positive predictive value","negative predictive value","failure rates","routine basis","infrared video angiography","improved outcomes","conjunction","case of uneventful healing","minimal additional operative time","Indocyanine green","consecutive adipo","overestimation","underestimation","institution","confidence interval","METHODS","specificity"],"language":"en"},

A handful of literatures have summarized its clinical and radiologic features, whereas therapies for COVID-19 are rather limited. In order to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients, we did this timely descriptive study. 6 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled and received the transfusion of ABO-compatible convalescent plasma. The efficacy of this intervention was determined by the alleviation of symptoms, changes in radiologic abnormalities and laboratory tests. No obvious adverse effect observed during the treatment. Transfusion of convalescent plasma led to a resolution of ground glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation in patient #1, #2, #3, #4 and #6. In patient #1 and #5 who presented with SARS-CoV-2 in throat swab, convalescent plasma therapy elicited an elimination of virus. Serologic analysis indicated an immediate increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers in patient #2 and #3, but not in patient #1. This study indicates that convalescent plasma therapy is effective and specific for COVID-19. This intervention has a special significance for eliminating SARS-CoV-2 and is believed to be a promising state-of-art therapy during COVID-19 pandemic crisis. This article is protected by copyright.

APPROACH Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), charge storage capacity (CSC), charge injection limit (CIL), and voltage transient (VT) impedance were measured bench-top before and after implant and in vivo. Coated Pt-Ir and uncoated Pt electrode arrays were implanted into cochlea of normal hearing rats and stimulated for ~4 hours/day, 5 days/week for 5 weeks. Neural function was monitored using electrically-evoked auditory brainstem responses. After explant, the electrode surfaces were assessed, and cochleae examined histologically. MAIN RESULTS When measured on bench-top before and after stimulation, Pt-Ir coated electrodes had significantly lower VT impedance (p \u003C 0.001) and significantly higher CSC (p \u003C 0.001) and CIL (p \u003C 0.001) compared to uncoated Pt electrodes. In vivo, the CSC and CIL of Pt-Ir were significantly higher than Pt throughout the implantation period (p = 0.047 and p \u003C 0.001, respectively); however, the VT impedance (p = 0.3) was not. There was no difference in foreign body response between material cohorts, although cochleae implanted with coated electrodes contained small deposits of Pt-Ir. There was no evidence of increased neural loss or loss of neural function in either group. Surface examination revealed no Pt corrosion on any electrodes. SIGNIFICANCE Electrodeposited Pt-Ir electrodes demonstrated significant improvements in electrochemical performance on the bench-top and in vivo compared to uncoated Pt. Neural function and tissue response to Pt-Ir electrodes were not different from uncoated Pt, despite small deposits of Pt-Ir in the tissue capsule. Electrodeposited Pt-Ir coatings offer promise as an improved electrode coating for active neural prostheses.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dalrymple, Ashley N; Huynh, Mario; Nayagam, Bryony Ariya; Lee, Curtis; Weiland, Greg R; Petrossians, Artin; Whalen Iii, John J; Fallon, James B; Shepherd, Robert K","journal":"Journal of neural engineering","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2552/ab933d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408281/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CSC","CIL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CIL of Pt","Coated Pt-Ir","uncoated Pt electrodes","Pt corrosion","Electrodeposited Pt-Ir coatings","SIGNIFICANCE Electrodeposited Pt-Ir electrodes","small deposits of Pt","uncoated Pt electrode arrays","coated electrodes","loss of neural function","bench","lower VT impedance","tissue response","electrode surfaces","higher CSC","improved electrode coating","active neural prostheses","evidence of increased neural loss","APPROACH Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","biological response","electrochemical properties","electrochemical performance","cochleae","foreign body response","electrodeposited Platinum-Iridium","surface characterization","tissue capsule","Surface examination","chronic stimulation","charge storage capacity","charge injection limit","EIS","promise","significant improvements","material cohorts","cochlear implants","voltage transient","cochlea of normal hearing rats","implantation period","days","difference","evoked auditory brainstem responses","hours","group","weeks","MAIN RESULTS","OBJECTIVE","explant"],"language":"en"},

We sought to estimate and compare the COVID-19 CFR in Canada and the United States while adjusting for 2 potential biases in crude CFR. METHODS We used the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Canada and the US from Jan. 31 to Apr. 22, 2020. We applied a statistical method to minimize bias in the crude CFR by accounting for the survival interval as the lag time between disease onset and death, while considering reporting rates of COVID-19 cases less than 50% (95% confidence interval 10%-50%). RESULTS Using data for confirmed cases in Canada, we estimated the crude CFR to be 4.9% on Apr. 22, 2020, and the adjusted CFR to be 5.5% (credible interval [CrI] 4.9%-6.4%). After we accounted for various reporting rates less than 50%, the adjusted CFR was estimated at 1.6% (CrI 0.7%-3.1%). The US crude CFR was estimated to be 5.4% on Apr. 20, 2020, with an adjusted CFR of 6.1% (CrI 5.4%-6.9%). With reporting rates of less than 50%, the adjusted CFR for the US was 1.78 (CrI 0.8%-3.6%). INTERPRETATION Our estimates suggest that, if the reporting rate is less than 50%, the adjusted CFR of COVID-19 in Canada is likely to be less than 2%. The CFR estimates for the US were higher than those for Canada, but the adjusted CFR still remained below 2%.

An ethical dilemma arises when one effective vaccine has been successfully developed against an epidemic disease and researchers seek to test the efficacy of another vaccine for the same pathogen in clinical trials involving human subjects. On the one hand, there are compelling reasons why it would be unethical to trial a novel vaccine when an effective product exists already. First, it is a firm principle of medical ethics that an effective treatment or vaccine should not be withheld from patients if their life may depend on it. Second, since epidemic outbreaks often emerge in settings with less-resourced health systems, there is a pronounced risk that any trial withholding an effective vaccine would disproportionately affect the vulnerable populations that historically have been exploited for biomedical research. Third, clinical trials for novel vaccines may be at odds with efforts to control active outbreaks. On the other hand, it may be justified to conduct a trial for a candidate vaccine if it is expected to have certain advantages compared with the existing product. This essay discusses key factors for comparing vaccines against epidemic pathogens, including immunological, logistical and economic considerations. Alongside a case study of the development of vaccines for Ebola, the essay seeks to establish a general framework that should be expanded and populated by immunologists, epidemiologists, economists and bioethicists, and ultimately could be applied to the case of COVID-19 vaccines.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Monrad, Joshua Teperowski","journal":"Journal of medical ethics","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414757/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effective vaccine","novel vaccines","candidate vaccine","development of vaccines","effective product","epidemic outbreaks","effective treatment","epidemic pathogens","clinical trials","essay","epidemic disease","active outbreaks","case of COVID","hand","health of individuals","existing product","case study","resourced health systems","settings","odds","firm principle of medical ethics","key factors","human subjects","pronounced risk","efforts","powerful measure","immunologists","epidemiologists","economists","bioethicists","economic considerations","compelling reasons","certain advantages","researchers","Ebola","ethical dilemma","vulnerable populations","general framework","patients","efficacy","biomedical research","life","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

The aim of our study was to investigate the changes of liver function and its clinical significance in COVID-19 patients. METHOD This retrospective, single-center study was conducted on 115 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 18 to Feb 22, 2020. Liver function and related indexes were analyzed to evaluate its relationship with disease progression in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS Part of the COVID-19 patients presented with varying degrees of abnormality in liver function indexes. However, the levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, GGT and LDH in COVID-19 patients were not significantly different in compared with hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia patients, and the levels of albumin is even significantly higher. Levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, LDH and INR showed statistically significant elevation in severe COVID-19 cases compared with that in mild cases. However, the clinical significance of the elevation is unremarkable. Majority of severe COVID-19 patients showed significantly decreasing in albumin level and continuously decreasing in the progress of illness. Most of the liver function indexes in COVID-19 patients were correlated with CRP and NLR, the markers of inflammation. Logistic regression analysis further identified NLR as the independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, as well as age. CONCLUSIONS Although abnormalities of liver function indexes are common in COVID-19 patients, the impairment of liver function is not a prominent feature of COVID-19, and also may not have serious clinical consequences.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yafei; Zheng, Liang; Liu, Lan; Zhao, Mengya; Xiao, Jun; Zhao, Qiu","journal":"Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/liv.14455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32239796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs2ODY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Wuhan University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["confirmed cases of COVID","Majority of severe COVID","pneumonia patients","changes of liver function","impairment of liver function","prominent feature of COVID","abnormalities of liver function indexes","related indexes","clinical significance","levels of ALT","levels of albumin","LDH","TBIL","NLR","AST","mild cases","serious clinical consequences","significant elevation","albumin level","single-center study","pandemic","INR","varying degrees of abnormality","independent risk factor","GGT","ongoing global health emergency","retrospective","hospitalized community","relationship","disease progression","CONCLUSIONS","Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University","SARS-CoV","Logistic regression analysis","METHOD","CRP","markers of inflammation","BACKGROUND","progress of illness","aim","RESULTS","age"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY In this prospective active surveillance study, patients with community-acquired ILI hospitalised for at least 24 hours in the Emergency Room (ER) of Gazi University Hospital were identified according to the ICD-10 codes at hospital admission through active surveillance of the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 influenza seasons. The presence of influenza and other respiratory viruses was analysed in the nasopharyngeal or pharyngeal specimens by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS 351 patients admitted to emergency room with certain ICD-10 codes were assessed, and 111 patients with ILI were included in the study. We detected 15 influenza and 23 other respiratory viruses in 33 of the 111 patients. More than one virus was detected in 5 patients. No virus was detected in a majority of the patients with ILI. The sensitivity of hospital admission/discharge ICD-10 codes used in the study to detect real influenza cases was low. Patients with influenza were admitted to the hospital more frequently with high fever symptoms compared with patients with influenza virus-negative and other respiratory virus-positive (p \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This study revealed that non-influenza respiratory viruses were a major contributor to ILI. Patients admitted with fever during the influenza seasons should be evaluated for influenza virus infection, and the use of diagnostic codes in surveillance studies can lead to incorrect results.","publish_time":"2019-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aysert-Yildiz, Pinar; Aktas, Firdevs","journal":"Journal of infection in developing countries","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.10893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32087074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI","Gazi University Hospital"],"locations":["ICD-10"],"keyphrases":["surveillance of patients","influenza seasons","influenza burden","INTRODUCTION Influenza","presence of influenza","ILI","influenza virus-negative","influenza virus infection","non-influenza respiratory viruses","real influenza cases","respiratory virus-positive","surveillance studies","prospective active surveillance study","sensitivity of hospital admission","Emergency Room","use of diagnostic codes","discharge ICD","certain ICD","Gazi University Hospital","incorrect results","high fever symptoms","pharyngeal specimens","real-time polymerase chain reaction","major contributor","community","complete assessment","hours","information","METHODOLOGY","illness","outpatient data","CONCLUSIONS","majority"],"language":"en"},

The study aims to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of our technique of robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (RSPDP) by a stepwise approach. METHODS The data of consecutive patients presented for RSPDP from 2014 to 2019 at Verona University were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. The patients were divided into two groups based on the surgical procedure performed, such as Kimura\u0027s (KG) or Warshaw\u0027s (WG) technique, and then compared. RESULTS In the study period, 32 patients underwent RSPDP. Twenty-three patients presented for the Kimura procedure (72%), while nine patients underwent the Warshaw procedure (28%). A higher body mass index was found in the KG (26 \u00B1 4 vs. 22 \u00B1 3, p = 0.037). Regarding the pathological data, the WG group differed in the tumor dimension, and the lymph nodes harvested (30 \u00B1 2 vs. 17 \u00B1 10, 9 \u00B1 5 vs. 3 \u00B1 4, p = 0.0028, and p = 0.005, respectively). Notably, no conversions and mortality were recorded. The overall morbidity was 25% ( eight patients) with no difference between the groups (p = 0.820). The mean length of stay was 8 days, and was similar between the groups (p = 0.350). CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that RSPDP is a valid option for the treatment of benign or pre-malignant pancreatic diseases of the distal pancreas, with comparable morbidity with the standard treatment and no mortality. Further research is needed to standardize the technique and to assess the immunological, surgical, and financial benefits of the procedure.","publish_time":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Esposito, A; Casetti, L; De Pastena, M; Ramera, M; Montagnini, G; Landoni, L; Bassi, C; Salvia, R","journal":"Updates in surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-020-00731-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32162271/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs3OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Verona University","RSPDP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RSPDP","data of consecutive patients","surgical procedure","groups","distal pancreatectomy","Kimura procedure","Warshaw procedure","treatment of benign","distal pancreas","pre-malignant pancreatic diseases","technique of robotic spleen","study period","present study","mortality","standard treatment","WG group","comparable morbidity","invasive approach","pathological data","stepwise approach","overall morbidity","tumor dimension","valid option","days","feasibility","financial benefits","higher body mass index","mean length of stay","lymph nodes","BACKGROUND","Warshaw\u0027s","Kimura\u0027s","safety","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","difference","RESULTS","Verona University","conversions","research","database"],"language":"en"},

Methods: The dates of hospitalization/isolation treatment of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases in different provinces in China reported as of 23 February, 2020 were collected. The Location Based Service (LBS) big data platform of \u0022Baidu Migration\u0022 was employed to obtain the data of the proportion of the floating population from Wuhan to all parts of the country. Effective distance models and linear regression models were established to analyze the relationship between the effective distance and the arrival time of the epidemic as well as the number of cumulative confirmed cases at provincial and municipal levels. Results: The arrival time of the epidemic and the cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 had significant linear relationship at both provincial and municipal levels in China, and the regression coefficients of each linear model were significant (P\u003C0.001). At the provincial level, the effective distance could explain about 71% of the variation of the model with arrival time along with around 90% of the variation for the model in the cumulative confirmed case magnitude; at the municipal level, the effective distance could explain about 66% of the variation for the model in arrival time, and about 85% of the variation of the model with the cumulative confirmed case magnitude. Conclusions: The fitting degree of the models are good. The LBS big data and effective distance model can be used to estimate the track, time and extent of epidemic spread to provide useful reference for early warning, prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Z K; Chen, Z S; Du, A H; Wang, C Y; Liu, H; Wang, Z W; Hu, J F","journal":"Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200306-00269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340090/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Location Based Service"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["linear model","Effective distance models","arrival time","number of cumulative confirmed cases","cumulative numbers of confirmed cases","cumulative number of confirmed cases of COVID","epidemic data","variation","cumulative confirmed case magnitude","LBS big data","linear regression models","municipal levels","provincial level","big data platform","significant linear relationship","extent of epidemic spread","China","control of emerging infectious diseases","early warning","regression coefficients","prevention","useful reference","different provinces","Wuhan","Service","isolation treatment","macroscopic perspective","floating population","parts","dates of hospitalization","fitting degree","proportion","Baidu Migration","Location","track","Methods","Conclusions","country","system","Results","Objective"],"language":"en"},

METHODS This retrospective study was conducted in 11 patients with established diagnosis of COVID-19 and 10 patients with diseases other than COVID- 19 in our hospital. We collected samples of serum, plasma and whole blood from each patient between February, 12 and 18, 2020, and with a double- blind design, the samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation at 56 \u2103 for 30 min. In all the samples, the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using immunochromatography, and the IgM antibodies were detected using fluorescence immunochromatography; the IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum and plasma samples detected with chemiluminescence immunoassay. We compared the detection results and analyzed the correlation of semi-quantitative detection results of IgM and IgG antibodies before and after heat inactivation of the samples. RESULTS With immuno-chromatography, the coincidence rate of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection before and after heat inactivation of the serum and plasma samples was 90.0% in COVID-19 cases and 100.0% in the negative cases, resulting in a total coincidence rate 95.2%; for the whole blood samples, the total coincidence rates of the total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were 100.0%. For detection of IgM antibodies in the serum, plasma and whole blood samples using fluorescence immunochromatography, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were 100.0%, 0 and 47.6%, respectively. For detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies and plasma IgG antibodies with chemiluminescence immunoassay, the coincidence rates in SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative cases and the total coincidence rate before and after inactivation were all 100.0%, and the total coincidence rate of plasma IgM antibodies was 95.2%. Pearson correlation analysis of the semi-quantitative results of IgM and IgG detection in the serum and plasma samples showed a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 (95%CI: 0.9998-1.000, P \u003C 0.001) between the results before and after sample inactivation. CONCLUSIONS Heat inactivation of blood samples at 56 \u2103 for 30 min does not obviously affect the results of immunochromatography and chemiluminescent immunoassay for detection of SARS-COV-2 antibodies but can reduce the risk of infection for the operators. Heat-inactivated samples can not be used in fluorescence immunochromatography for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.","publish_time":"2020-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xue, Xiongyan; Zhu, Changlin; Huang, Shaozhen; Pan, Lianhua; Xu, Jianhua; Li, Weixuan","journal":"Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376571/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pearson"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["plasma samples","detection of IgM antibodies","detection of SARS","samples of serum","total SARS-CoV","results of SARS","plasma IgG antibodies","total coincidence rate of plasma IgM antibodies","detection of serum IgM","IgG detection","total coincidence rates","effects of heat inactivation of blood samples","CONCLUSIONS Heat inactivation of blood samples","Heat-inactivated samples","antibody detection","results of immunochromatography","correlation of semi-quantitative detection results of IgM","semi-quantitative results of IgM","sample inactivation","fluorescence immunochromatography","negative cases","chemiluminescence immunoassay","chemiluminescent immunoassay","correlation coefficient","patients","Pearson correlation analysis","established diagnosis of COVID","different methods","immuno-chromatography","retrospective study","double- blind design","risk of infection","operators","diseases","OBJECTIVE","hospital"],"language":"en"},

We examine the effects of these interventions, based on modeling of the unfolding epidemic. We test modeling options of the spatially explicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from the initial foci to the rest of Italy. We estimate parameters of a metacommunity Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)-like transmission model that includes a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We estimate a generalized reproduction number ([Formula: see text] = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential spread in the absence of containment interventions. The model includes the implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020. We account for uncertainty in epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and awareness-dependent exposure probabilities. We draw scenarios of different containment measures and their impact. Results suggest that the sequence of restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by 45% (42 to 49%). Averted hospitalizations are measured by running scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about 200,000 individuals (as of March 25, 2020). Although a number of assumptions need to be reexamined, like age structure in social mixing patterns and in the distribution of mobility, hospitalization, and fatality, we conclude that verifiable evidence exists to support the planning of emergency measures.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gatto, Marino; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Mari, Lorenzo; Miccoli, Stefano; Carraro, Luca; Casagrandi, Renato; Rinaldo, Andrea","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004978117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32327608/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI3LmNzdjs5NTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1194243,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:05Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"JlLRwN9TRFTaKjXvr3FLDQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_27.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transmission containment","transmission model","distribution of mobility","asymptomatic transmission","scenarios of different containment measures","drastic measures","time dependence of human mobility matrices","human interactions","imposed restrictions","sequence of restrictions","absence of containment interventions","rest of Italy","planning of emergency measures","implementation of progressive restrictions","potential spread","modeling options","number of assumptions","spread of coronavirus disease","generalized reproduction number","awareness-dependent exposure probabilities","social mixing patterns","critical contribution of presymptomatic","high resolution","epidemiological reporting","generation matrix","initial foci","age structure","Formula","explicit type","fatality","provinces","COVID","network","wave of infections","metacommunity Susceptible","verifiable evidence","uncertainty","total","individuals","SEIR","case","impact","spectral radius","parameters","unfolding epidemic","Averted hospitalizations","text","Results","effects"],"language":"en"},

Aims: The purpose of this study was to summarize the incidence of liver injury and the differences between liver injury markers among different patients with COVID-19 in China. Methods: Computer searches of PubMed, Embase, CNKI and medRxiv were used to obtain reports on the incidence and markers of liver injury in Chinese patients with COVID-19, from January 1, 2020 to April 10, 2020. (No. CRD42020181350) Results: A total of 57 reports from China were included, including 9889 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. The results of the meta-analysis showed that among the patients with early COVID-19 infection in China, the incidence of liver injury events was 24.7% (95% CI, 23.4%-26.4%). Liver injury in severe patients was more common than that in non-severe patients, with a risk ratio of 2.07 (95% CI, 1.77 to 2.43).

We attempted to quantitatively evaluate the risk of COVID-19 infections on students caused by school reopening. Study design: We collected the data of the numbers of teachers, population size and newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the past 14 days in typical provinces/cities of China, and then analyzed the risk of COVID-19 infections in schools with respect to each province/city. Methods: A step-by-step procedure was explored to calculate the probability of COVID-19 infections on students as transmitted from infected teachers. Two critical assumptions for analysis were proposed: (i) only locally generated cases were counted while imported cases were omitted; (ii) the secondary attack rate of the COVID-19 virus in schools is similar to that in households in China, ranging from 3-10%. Results: The probability of COVID-19 resurgence within one week on students of primary, middle and high schools in China (outside Hubei) is extremely low (\u003C0.2%) in each province/city, and such probability can be updated daily and weekly based on the newly confirmed cases in the past 14 days. In some areas without newly confirmed cases in the past 14 days, the risk is zero. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for local governments to make risk level-based policies for school reopening. Currently, the risk of COVID-19 infections on students is extremely low in China (outside Hubei) and therefore school reopening can be initiated without the endanger of infections on students.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Long, Cheng; Zeng, Tieyong; FU, XINMIAO","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bde55b7dd004dbe9406fb8289922dcaf27554164.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053645","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["risk of COVID","confirmed COVID","infections","probability of COVID","confirmed cases","School reopening","students of primary","days","cities of China","generated cases","risk level-based policies","high schools","Hubei","city","numbers of teachers","infected teachers","local governments","guidance","week","population size","typical provinces","work","data","virus","respect","resurgence","great concern","secondary attack rate","households","outbreak","step-by-step procedure","critical assumptions","analysis","Methods","Study design","stage","Conclusions","areas","Objective","Results"],"language":"en"},

Design: A retrospective descriptive study Setting: China Participants: Epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis. Main outcome measure: Prevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government, epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fisher\u0027s exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis. Results: COVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where \u003E50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days). By February 11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 patient died. Conclusion: Strict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. Controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Most COVID-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset. Multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities had been observed before significant respiratory dysfunction.

Our model dynamics is expressed by a single prognostic variable in an integro-differential equation. All unknown parameters are described with a single, timedependent variable {kappa}(t). We show that our model has similarities to classic compartmental models, such as SIR, and that the variable {kappa}(t) can be interpreted as the effective reproduction number Reff. The advantages of our approach are the simplicity of having only one equation, the numerical stability due to an integral formulation and the reliability because the model is formulated with the most trustable statistical data variable: the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19. Once this dynamic variable is calculated, other non-dynamic variables, such as the number of heavy cases (hospital beds), the number of intensive-care cases (ICUs) and the fatalities, can be derived from it using a similarly stable, integral approach. The formulation with a single equation allows us to calculate from real data the values of the effective reproduction number, which can then be fitted. The extrapolated values of {kappa} can be used in the model to make a reliable forecasts, though under the assumption that measures for reducing infections are maintained. We have applied our model to more than 15 countries and results are available via a web-based platform. In this paper we focus on the data for two exemplary countries, Italy and Germany, and show that the model is capable of reproducing the course of the epidemic in the past and forecasting its course for a period of two to three weeks with a reasonable numerical stability.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koehler-Rieper, F.; Roehl, C.

The disease in notably severe in elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. The molecular mechanism as to why the elderly are vulnerable and why children are resistant is largely unknown. Understanding these differences is critical for safeguarding the vulnerable and guiding effective policy and treatments. Here we show loading cells with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) enhances the endocytic entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2. Super resolution imaging of the SARS-CoV-2 entry point with high cholesterol showed markedly increased apparent diameter (~10% to 100 nm) and almost twice the total number of viral entry points. The cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE2) to the viral entry site where SARS-CoV-2 docks to properly exploit entry into the cell. Furthermore, we show cholesterol enhances binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the cell surface which increases association with the endocytic pathway. Decreasing cellular cholesterol has the opposite effect. Based on these findings and known loading of cholesterol into peripheral tissue during aging and inflammation, we build a cholesterol dependent model for COVID19 lethality in elderly and the chronically ill. As cholesterol increases with age and inflammation (e.g. smoking and diabetes), the cell surface is coated with viral entry points and optimally assembled viral entry proteins. Importantly our model suggests high levels of cholesterol is most alarming in the tissue, not the blood. In fact, rapidly dropping cholesterol in the blood may indicate severe loading of cholesterol in peripheral tissue and a dangerous situation for escalated SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) oppose the effects of cholesterol and provide a molecular basis for eating healthy diets to avoid severe cases of COVID19.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Hao; Yuan, Zixuan; Pavel, Mahmud Arif; Hansen, Scott B.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/71c73d823965c0bc649dd59d8a69b9c320c1469f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.09.086249","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan China"],"keyphrases":["high cholesterol","effects of cholesterol","cellular cholesterol","severe loading of cholesterol","known loading of cholesterol","high levels of cholesterol","cholesterol dependent model","endocytic entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV","escalated SARS-CoV","viral entry site","viral entry proteins","binding of SARS","cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E","elderly","total number of viral entry points","severe cases of COVID19","peripheral tissue","cell surface","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","blood serum","COVID19 lethality","inflammation","loading cells","Coronavirus disease","respiratory infection","molecular basis","endocytic pathway","molecular mechanism","apoE","dangerous situation","healthy diets","PUFAs","ACE2","children","smoking","association","diabetes","enzyme","Super resolution imaging","Polyunsaturated fatty acids","underlying chronic conditions","effective policy","treatments","opposite effect","angiotensinogen","age","apparent diameter","findings","infectivity","docks","differences","Wuhan China","nm","fact"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a COVID-19 diagnosis, from December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020, at Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis. Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, to lower the SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Xufang; Zhang, Xian; Chen, Xuhui; Chen, Liwen; Deng, Chaohua; Zou, Xiaojing; Liu, Weiyong; Yu, Huimin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c10661c9b35e068691b879661bcebeba3bd6aad9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20027938","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-COV","incidence of SARS","nosocomial infection of SARS","RT-PCR assay","Cross-sectional study of patients","lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS","clinical diagnosis of COVID","ocular surface","laboratory diagnosis","chest Computed Tomography","ocular discharges","SD","mean","years","total","conjunctivitis","Tongji hospital","clinical symptoms","gestational age","Tongji medical college","Huazhong University of Science","polymerase-chain","reaction","abnormalities","sampling time lag","real-time reverse-transcriptase","blood routine test","RNA fragments","inefficient diagnostic method","occupational exposure","temperature","eyes","potential route","Technology","protective goggles","Methods","health care workers","Demographics","Purpose","aim","Results","Conclusions","Female","women"],"language":"en"},

GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition is dependent upon neuronal chloride regulation. The electroneutral cation-chloride transporter KCC2 mediates neuronal chloride extrusion; an age-dependent increase of KCC2 expression enables the shift of GABAergic signaling from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. BDNF-TrkB activation following excitotoxic injury recruits downstream targets like PLC\u03B31, leading to KCC2 hypofunction. This study investigated the efficacy of partial and full TrkB agonists; LM22A-4 (LM), HIOC and Deoxygedunin (DG) respectively, on PB-refractory seizures, post-ischemic TrkB-pathway activation, and KCC2 membrane stability in a P7 CD-1 mouse model of refractory neonatal seizures. Anti-seizure efficacy was determined by quantifying seizure burdens with continuous video-EEG. LM rescued PB-refractory seizures in a sexually dimorphic manner. LM anti-seizure efficacy was associated with a significant reduction in the post-ischemic phosphorylation of TrkB at Y816, a site known to mediate post-ischemic KCC2 hypofunction via PLC\u03B31 activation. LM additionally rescued ischemia-induced pKCC2-S940 dephosphorylation preserving its membrane stability. HIOC and DG, two novel full TrkB agonists, also rescued PB-refractoriness and post-ischemic TrkB-PLC\u03B31 pathway activation. Additionally, chemogenetic inactivation of TrkB significantly reduced post-ischemic neonatal seizure burdens at P7. Developmental expression profiles of TrkB and KCC2 in na\u00EFve pups identified developmental differences that may underlie the sex-dependent variance in anti-seizure efficacy. These results support a novel role for the TrkB receptor in the emergence of age-dependent refractory neonatal seizures.","publish_time":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kipnis, P.A.; Sullivan, B.J.; Carter, B.M.; Kadam, S.D.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34b44dea9ec9358f12d299ff4c47569e94a4389e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.23.887190","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TrkB receptor","TrkB agonists","post-ischemic phosphorylation of TrkB","post-ischemic TrkB-pathway activation","dependent refractory neonatal seizures","post-ischemic TrkB-PLC\u03B31 pathway activation","BDNF-TrkB activation","post-ischemic neonatal seizure burdens","post-ischemic KCC2 hypofunction","LM anti-seizure efficacy","LM rescued PB-refractory seizures","chemogenetic inactivation of TrkB","mouse model of refractory neonatal seizures","PLC\u03B31 activation","Developmental expression profiles of TrkB","KCC2 membrane stability","age-dependent increase of KCC2 expression","quantifying seizure burdens","line anti-seizure medications","PB-refractoriness","efficacy of partial","electroneutral cation-chloride transporter KCC2","neuronal chloride extrusion","neuronal chloride regulation","sex-dependent variance","HIOC","emergence of age","P7 CD","GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition","developmental differences","GABAA receptors","novel role","rescued ischemia-induced pKCC2-S940 dephosphorylation","excitotoxic injury recruits downstream targets","ASMs","na\u00EFve pups","positive allosteric modulator","significant reduction","phenobarbital","Y816","site","continuous video-EEG","shift of GABAergic","LM22A","dimorphic manner","depolarizing","results","study","Deoxygedunin"],"language":"en"},

While this is usually an effective and reliable method, the current efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic demand more efficient measures. Diagnostic assays can be scaled up by the method of High-Throughput qPCR via sample pooling. Pooling, the action of combining multiple samples into one tube, is most effective when the chance of positive detection of the target, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, is low. In such cases, large groups of samples can be conclusively classified as negative with a single test, with no need to individually test every sample. However, different frequencies of the target-product presence in the samples, require different pool/batch sizes for optimal results. Here, we present two possible optimized pooling strategies for diagnostic SARSCoV-2 testing on large scales, each one better suited for a different range of target frequency. In the first, we employ a simple information-theoretic heuristic to derive a highly efficient re-pooling protocol: an estimate of the target frequency determines the initial pool size, and any subsequent pools found positive are re-pooled at half-size and tested again. In the range of very rare target (\u003C0.05), this approach can reduce the number of necessary tests dramatically. For example, this method achieves a reduction of a factor of 50 for a target frequency of 0.001. The second method is a simpler approach of optimized one-time pooling followed by individual tests on positive pools. We show that this approach is just as efficient for moderate target-product frequencies (0.05\u003C0.2). For example, it reduces the number of tests needed by half if the frequency of positives samples is 0.07. We show that both methods are comparable to the absolute upper-bound efficiency given by Shannon\u0027s source coding theorem. Our strategies require no investment at all, and they offer a significant reduction in the amount of equipment and time needed to test large numbers of samples. Both approaches are dynamic; they can be easily implemented in different conditions with various infection rates and sample numbers. We compare our strategies to the naive way of testing and also to alternative matrix methods. Most importantly, we offer practical pooling instructions for laboratories that perform large scale qPCR assays to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shani-Narkiss, Haran; Gilday, Omri David; Yayon, Nadav; Landau, Itamar Daniel","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7009ba62167382fab0a64abc6545f248972ed028.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20052159","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Shannon"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sample pooling","different range of target frequency","large numbers of samples","rare target","large groups of samples","frequency of positives samples","multiple samples","patient samples","target-product presence","efficient re-pooling protocol","different pool","possible optimized pooling strategies","Diagnostic assays","moderate target-product frequencies","different frequencies","large scale qPCR assays","practical pooling instructions","simpler approach of optimized one-time pooling","positive pools","different conditions","large scales","method of High","reliable method","sample numbers","number of tests","Throughput qPCR","SARS-CoV","diagnostic SARSCoV","efficient measures","individual tests","number of necessary tests","single test","example","initial pool size","chance of positive detection","subsequent pools","half-size","significant reduction","naive way of testing","alternative matrix methods","laboratories","absolute upper-bound efficiency","various infection rates","quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction","estimate","batch sizes","Shannon\u0027s source coding theorem","COVID","current efforts","pandemic demand","optimal results","equipment","simple information-theoretic heuristic","factor","viral particles","need","tube","cases","approaches","investment"],"language":"en"},

Data about COVID-19 infection in cancer patients are scarce, and they point out a higher risk of complications due to the viral infection in this population. Moreover, cancer treatments could increase viral complications, specially those treatments based on the use of immunotherapy with checkpoints antibodies. There are no clinical data about the safety of immune check point antibodies in cancer patients when they become infected by SARS-CoV-2. As checkpoint inhibitors, mainly anti PD-1 and anti CTLA-4 antibodies, are an effective treatment for most melanoma patients, avoiding their use during the pandemic could lead to a decrease in the chances of curing melanoma.

A retrospective analysis of patients included in the Spanish registery has been performed weekly since the activation of the study. Interim analysis shows unexpected findings about cancer treatment safety in SARS-Cov-2 infected melanoma patients, so a rapid communication to the scientific community is mandatory Results: Fifty patients have been included as of May 17th, 2020. Median age is 69 years (range 6 to 94 years), 27 (54%) patients are males and 36 (70%) patients have stage IV melanoma. Twenty-two (44%) patients were on active anticancer treatment with anti PD-1 antibodies, 16 (32%) patients were on treatment with BRAF plus MEK inhibitors and 12 (24%) patients were not on active cancer treatment. COVID-19 episode has been resolved in 43 cases, including 30 (70%) patients cured, four (9%) patients that have died due to melanoma progression, and nine (21%) patients that have died from COVID-19. Mortality rates from COVID-19 according to melanoma treatment type were 16%, 15% and 36% for patients on immunotherapy, targeted drugs, and for those that were not undergoing active cancer treatment, respectively. Conclusion: These preliminary findings show that the risk of death in those patients undergoing treatment with anti PD-1 antibodies does not exceed the global risk of death in this population. These results could be relevant in order to select melanoma therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gonzalez-Cao, M.; Antonazas-Basa, M.; Puertolas, T.; Munoz-Couselo, E.; Manzano, J.

Despite the high prevalence of these conditions, a mechanistic association of its interactions in COVID-19 remain unclear. Here, we identify risk factors and propose a clinical score to predict 30-day lethality in COVID-19 cases, including specific factors for diabetes and obesity and its role in improving risk prediction. METHODS: We obtained data of suspected, confirmed and negative COVID-19 cases and their demographic and health characteristics from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of Mexican Ministry of Health. We investigated specific risk factors associated to SARS-CoV-2 positivity and mortality due to COVID-19. Additionally, we explored the impact of diabetes and obesity on COVID-19 related outcomes and their interaction with other comorbidities in modifying COVID-19 related lethality. Finally, we built our clinical score to predict 30-day lethality using the previously identified risk factors. RESULTS: Among 49,570 evaluated subjects (at April 19th, 2020), we observed an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (n=8,261) in those with diabetes, obesity, male subjects and in patients with diabetes and age \u003C40 years (early-onset). Risk factors for increased lethality in COVID-19 includes early-onset diabetes obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, advanced age, immunosuppression, and chronic kidney disease; we also found that obesity mediates 47.8% of the effect of diabetes on COVID-19 lethality. Early-onset diabetes conferred an increased risk of hospitalization and obesity conferred an increased risk for ICU admission and intubation. Our predictive score for COVID-19 lethality included age [\u2265]65 years, diabetes, diabetes \u0026 age \u003C40 years, obesity, age \u003C40 years, CKD, pregnancy and immunosuppression and a categorization of low-risk, mild-risk, moderate-risk, high-risk and very high-risk significantly discriminates lethal from non-lethal COVID-19 cases (c-statistic=0.837). CONCLUSIONS: Here, we propose a mechanistic approach to evaluate risk for complication and lethality attributable to COVID-19 in patients with obesity and diabetes patients in a country with high susceptibility. Furthermore, our novel score offers a clinical tool for quick determination of high-risk susceptibility patients in a first contact scenario.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bello-Chavolla, O.

Selenium concentration varies greatly depending on the geographic area. Consequently, the content of selenium in food products is also variable. It is known that low Se is associated with increased incidence of cancer and heart diseases. Therefore, it is advisable to supplement diet with this element albeit in a proper form. Although blood increased concentrations of Se can be achieved with various pharmacological preparations, only one chemical form (sodium selenite) can offer a true protection. Sodium selenite, but not selenate, can oxidize thiol groups in the virus protein disulfide isomerase rendering it unable to penetrate the healthy cell membrane. In this way selenite inhibits the entrance of viruses into the healthy cells and abolish their infectivity. Therefore, this simple chemical compound can potentially be used in the recent battle against coronavirus epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kieliszek, Marek; Lipinski, Boguslaw","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8cb0aadacd18440db073a54104cb4ac069abb97.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030698772031104X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698772031104X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsxNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Earth"],"keyphrases":["sodium selenite","low Se","chemical form","way selenite","content of selenium","Selenium concentration","Abstract Selenium","blood increased concentrations of Se","healthy cells","proper form","ubiquitous element akin","increased incidence of cancer","various pharmacological preparations","healthy cell membrane","simple chemical compound","virus protein disulfide isomerase","thiol groups","Earth crust","entrance of viruses","inorganic forms","heart diseases","sulfur","food products","selenate","recent battle","coronavirus epidemic","true protection","diet","infectivity","geographic area"],"language":"en"},

Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for poor clinical outcomes, but the association of diabetes with the prognosis of COVID-19 have not been reported yet. Methods In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020. The cases were confirmed by real-time PCR and the demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Prognosis was defined as hospitalization, discharged survivor and death, which was followed up until March 12, 2020. Results Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 138 (53.5%) were male. No significant differences in age and sex were identified between patients with and without diabetes. Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%), and fatigue (38%). Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those without diabetes. COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severe or critical disease condition with more complications at presentation, and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%). Cox proportional hazard model showed that diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 12.21) and fasting blood glucose (aHR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) were associated with the fatality of COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions Diabetes mellitus is associated with greater disease severity and a higher risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19.

Setting: This study was conducted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Spain). Methods: A cohort analysis of seven patients with SCI infected by Covid-19 was carried out. Diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal exudate or sputum samples. Clinical, analytical and radiographic findings were registered. Results: RT-PCR detected COVID-19 infection in all patients, affecting males and people with a cervical level of injury more often (5 out 7). The average delay for diagnostic confirmation was 4 days (interquartile range, 1-10). Fever was the most frequent symptom (6 out of 7). The second most common symptom was asthenia (4 out of 7), followed by dyspnea, cough and expectoration (3 out of 7 for each symptom). The MEWS score for Covid-19 severity rating was classified as severe in 5 out of 7. All but one patient showed radiological alterations evident in chest X-Rays at the time of diagnosis. All patients recovered gradually. Conclusion: Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population. Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity. The clinical evolution was not as pronounced as had been expected.

New ways of screening the general population for COVID-19 are urgently needed along with novel effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hypothesis A hypothetical three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment approach based on an up-to-date scientific literature review for COVID- 19 is proposed. Regarding diagnosis, a validated screening questionnaire and digital app for COVID-19 could help identify individuals who are at risk of transmitting the disease, as well as those at highest risk for poor clinical outcomes. Global implementation and online tracking of vital signs and scored questionnaires that are statistically validated would help health authorities properly allocate essential health care resources to test and isolate those at highest risk for transmission and poor outcomes. Second, regarding prevention, no validated protocols except for physical distancing, hand washing, and isolation exist, and recently ivermectin and the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine has been published to have anti-viral properties against COVID-19. A randomized trial of ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine alone, and/or nutraceuticals that have been published to support immune function including Vitamin C, zinc, and immunomodulatory supplements (3,6 Beta glucan) could be beneficial in preventing transmission or lessening symptomatology but requires statistical validation. Third, concerning treatment, COVID-19 induced inflammation and \u201Ccytokine storm syndrome\u201D with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) have resulted in extreme morbidity and mortality in those with certain comorbidities, secondary to \u201Cacute respiratory distress syndrome\u201D (ARDS) and multiorgan dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been published in the medical literature for ARDS, as well as viral and bacterial pneumonias, resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress. A randomized controlled trial of blocking NFKappa B and cytokine formation using glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine [NAC] and alpha lipoic acid) and PO/IV glutathione should be performed, along with an evaluation of Nrf2 activators (curcumin, sulforaphane glucosinolate) which have been scientifically proven to lower inflammation. Since high mortality rates from sepsis induced DIC due to COVID 19 infection has also been associated with thrombotic events and elevated levels of D-dimer, randomized controlled trials of using anticoagulant therapy with heparin is urgently required. This is especially important in patients on ventilators who have met certain sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria. The use of acetazolamide with or without sildenafil also needs to be explored with or without heparin, since increased oxygen delivery to vital organs through prevention of thrombosis/pulmonary emboli along with carbonic anhydrase inhibition may help increase oxygenation and prevent adverse clinical outcomes. Conclusion and Implications a three-part prevention, diagnostic, and treatment plan is proposed for addressing the severe complications of COVID-19. Digital monitoring of symptoms to clinically diagnose early exposure and response to treatment; prevention with hydroxychloroquine and/or ivermetin as well as nutritional therapies that support a healthy immune response; treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies that block NFKappaB and activate Nrf2 pathways, as well as novel therapies that address COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS with DIC including anticoagulation and/ or novel respiratory therapies with or without acetazolamide and sildenafil. These three broad-based interventions urgently need to be subjected to randomized, controlled trials.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Horowitz, Richard I.; Freeman, Phyllis R.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffe1951b4290fb8612750822753d08cdb19e09e6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720308276; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720308276?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyMjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","PO/IV","Digital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe complications of COVID","prevention of thrombosis","hypothetical three-part prevention","induced inflammation","treatment approach","treatment strategies","treatment plan","poor outcomes","highest risk","sepsis induced DIC","novel effective prevention","randomized trial of ivermectin","poor clinical outcomes","cytokine storm syndrome","glutathione precursors","randomized controlled trials","diagnostic","certain sepsis induced coagulopathy","alveolar glutathione","ARDS","IV glutathione","silent transmission","validated protocols","hydroxychloroquine","validated screening questionnaire","adverse clinical outcomes","global increase","heparin","randomized controlled trial of blocking NFKappa B","Macrophage Activation Syndrome","high mortality rates","cytokine formation","vital organs","acute respiratory distress syndrome","increased levels of free radical","certain comorbidities","health authorities","Global implementation","symptomatic infection","extreme morbidity","medical literature","lower inflammation","elevated levels of D","increased oxygen delivery","large numbers of individuals","anti-viral properties","online tracking of vital signs","essential health care resources","up-to-date scientific literature review","pulmonary emboli","hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis","zinc","NAC","cysteine","serum","N-acetyl","multiorgan dysfunction","oxygenation","physical distancing","HLH","dimer","alpha lipoic acid","red blood cell","immunomodulatory supplements","Vitamin C","hand washing","carbonic anhydrase inhibition","disseminated intravascular coagulation","curcumin","lessening symptomatology","MAS","ventilators","anticoagulant therapy","digital app","scored questionnaires","oxidative stress","thrombotic events","evaluation of Nrf2 activators","Abstract Purpose Asymptomatic","sulforaphane glucosinolate","Beta glucan","immune function","Deficiency","isolation","antimalarial drugs chloroquine","expansion","general population","pandemic","bacterial pneumonias","Implications","Hypothesis","statistical validation","New ways","patients","diagnosis","criteria","Conclusion","use of acetazolamide","sildenafil","nutraceuticals","disease","novel therapies","anti-inflammatory therapies","nutritional therapies","novel respiratory therapies","treatment","healthy immune response","anticoagulation","pneumonia","early exposure","prevention","NFKappaB","DIC","ivermetin","acetazolamide","COVID","Nrf2 pathways"],"language":"en"},

The diameter in current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population. We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 10X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to row-column group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes.

The simple and rapid detection techniques with high sensitivity and specificity are always urgently needed. However, the current nucleic acid detection techniques are still limited the traditional amplification and hybridization. To overcome the limitation, we here develop a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted DNA detection (CADD). In this detection, DNA sample is incubated with a pair of capture sgRNAs (sgRNAa and sgRNAb) specific to a target DNA, dCas9, a signal readout-related probe, and an oligo-coated solid support beads or microplate at room temperature for 15 min. During this incubation, the dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex is formed and captured on solid support by the capture sequence of sgRNAa and the signal readout-related probe is captured by the capture sequence of sgRNAb. Finally the detection result is reported by a fluorescent or colorimetric signal readout. This detection was verified by detecting DNA of bacteria, cancer cell and virus. Especially, by designing a set of sgRNAs specific to 15 high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), the HPV infection in 64 clinical cervical samples were successfully detected by the method.

Abstract Although bacteria are the main pathogens involved in community-acquired pneumonia, a significant number of community-acquired pneumonia are caused by viruses, either directly or as part of a co-infection. The clinical picture of these different pneumonias can be very similar, but viral infection is more common in the pediatric and geriatric populations, leukocytes are not generally elevated, fever is variable, and upper respiratory tract symptoms often occur; procalcitonin levels are not generally affected. For years, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell culture and antigen detection, but since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques in the clinical setting, identification of these pathogens has increased and new microorganisms such as human bocavirus have been discovered. In general, influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus are still the main pathogens involved in this entity. However, in recent years, outbreaks of deadly coronavirus and zoonotic influenza virus have demonstrated the need for constant alert in the face of new emerging pathogens. Neuraminidase inhibitors for viral pneumonia have been shown to reduce transmission in cases of exposure and to improve the clinical progress of patients in intensive care; their use in common infections is not recommended. Ribavirin has been used in children with syncytial respiratory virus, and in immunosuppressed subjects. Apart from these drugs, no antiviral has been shown to be effective. Prevention with anti-influenza virus vaccination and with monoclonal antibodies, in the case of syncytial respiratory virus, may reduce the incidence of pneumonia.","publish_time":"2015-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Galv\u00E1n, Jos\u00E9 Mar\u00EDa; Rajas, Olga; Aspa, Javier","journal":"Archivos de Bronconeumolog\u00EDa","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28f309f78ae68a7ad40bf2fb1b4cebece70c36e1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289615001076; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289615001076","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["of syncytial respiratory virus","influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus","the incidence of pneumonia","in community","In general","zoonosis de virus influenza","in the clinical setting","virus respiratorio sincitial","transmission in cases of exposure and","and in immunosuppressed subjects","principales virus implicados","influenza virus vaccination and with monoclonal","but since the introduction of","common in the pediatric and geriatric populations","been used in children with syncytial respiratory virus","in recent years","in common infections","outbreaks of deadly coronavirus and zoonotic influenza virus have demonstrated the need for constant alert in the face of new emerging pathogens","improve the clinical progress of patients in intensive care","identification of these pathogens","still the main pathogens","the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell","significant number of community","and antigen detection","The clinical picture of these different pneumonias can be very similar","acquired pneumonia","Neuraminidase inhibitors for viral pneumonia have been shown","either directly or as part of a co","increased and new microorganisms such as","and upper respiratory tract symptoms often occur","For years","bocavirus have been discovered","but viral infection","not generally elevated","not generally affected","not recommended","principales pat\u00F3genos involucrados","evoluci\u00F3n cl\u00EDnica","comunidad","neumon\u00EDas v\u00EDricas","Prevention with anti","Apart from these drugs","be effective","infecciones banales","neumon\u00EDa adquirida","importante n\u00FAmero de neumon\u00EDas adquiridas","incidencia de neumon\u00EDa","nuevos microorganismos","alta letalidad de coronavirus","chain reaction","procalcitonin levels","caused by","may","fever","Cuidados Intensivos","anticuerpos monoclonales","uso","coinfecci\u00F3n","Abstract Although bacteria","frecuencia","epidemias","pacientes","alerta","vacunaci\u00F3n","ni\u00F1os","cultivos celulares","detecci\u00F3n de ant\u00EDgenos","incorporaci\u00F3n","transmisi\u00F3n","casos expuestos","bacterias","PCR","However","entity","cifra de leucocitos","poblaci\u00F3n infantil","medidas de prevenci\u00F3n","s\u00EDntomas de v\u00EDas respiratorias altas","fiebre","irrupci\u00F3n","inhibidores","neuraminidasa","identificaci\u00F3n","diagn\u00F3stico","embargo","Resumen","ribavirina","f\u00E1rmacos","eficacia","procalcitonina"],"language":"es"},

Here we derive a simple and mathematically rigorous criterion for designing optimal transitory non-pharmaceutical interventions. We find that reducing the reproduction number below one is sufficient but not necessary. Instead, our criterion prescribes the required reduction in the reproduction number according to the maximum health services\u0027 capacity. To explore the implications of our theoretical results, we study the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in 16 cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we estimate the minimal reduction of the contact rate in each city that is necessary to control the epidemic optimally. We also compare the optimal start of the intervention with the start of the actual interventions applied in each city.

While the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationship of chloroquine is well established for malaria, there is sparse information regarding its dose-effect relationship in the context of COVID-19. Here, we explore the PK-PD relationship of chloroquine for COVID-19 by modelling both achievable systemic and pulmonary drug concentrations. Our data indicate that the standard anti-malarial treatment dose of 25mg/kg over three days does not deliver sufficient systemic drug exposures for the inhibition of viral replication. In contrast, PK predictions of chloroquine in the lungs using in-vivo data or human physiologically-based PK models, suggest that doses as low as 3mg/kg/day for 3 days could deliver exposures that are significantly higher than reported antiviral-EC90s for up to a week. Moreover, if pulmonary exposure is a driver for prevention, simulations show that chronic daily dosing of chloroquine may be unnecessary for prophylaxis purposes. Instead, once weekly doses of 5mg/kg would be sufficient to achieve a continuous cover of therapeutically active pulmonary exposures. These findings reveal a highly compartmentalised distribution of chloroquine in man that may significantly affect its therapeutic potential against COVID-19. The systemic circulation is shown as one site where chloroquine exposure is insufficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, if therapeutic activity is driven by pulmonary exposure, it should be possible to reduce the chloroquine dose to safe levels. Carefully designed randomized controlled trials are urgently required to address these outstanding issues.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aljayyoussi, G.; Rajoli, R.; Pertinez, H.; Pennington, S.; Hong, W.

A novel pneumonia (COVID-19) which is sweeping the globe was started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Most deaths occurred in severe and critically cases, but information on prognostic risk factors for severe ill patients is incomplete. Further research is urgently needed to guide clinicians, so we prospectively evaluate the clinical outcomes of 114 severe ill patients with COVID-19 for short-term in the Union Hospital in Wuhan, China. Methods. In this single-centered, prospective and observational study, we enrolled 114 severe ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Jan 23, 2020 to February 22, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic and laboratory information were collected at baseline, data on treatment and outcome were collected until the day of death or discharge or for the first 28 days after severe ill diagnosis, whichever was shorter. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of poor outcome. Results. Among enrolled 114 patients, 94 (82.5%) had good outcome while 20 (17.5%) had poor outcome. No significant differences were showed in age, gender and the prevalence of coexisting disorders between outcome groups. Results of multivariate Cox analyses indicated that higher levels of oxygen saturation (HR, 0.123; 95% CI, 0.041-0.369), albumin (HR, 0.060; 95% CI, 0.008-0.460) and arterial partial pressure of oxygen (HR, 0.321; 95% CI, 0.106-0.973) were associated with decreased risk of developing poor outcome within 28 days. In the other hand, higher levels of leucocytes (HR, 5.575; 95% CI, 2.080-14.943), neutrophils (HR, 2.566; 95% CI, 1.022-6.443), total bilirubin (HR, 6.171; 95% CI, 2.458-15.496), globulin (HR, 2.526; 95% CI, 1.027-6.211), blood urea nitrogen (HR, 5.640; 95% CI, 2.193-14.509), creatine kinase-MB (HR, 3.032; 95% CI, 1.203-7.644), lactate dehydrogenase (HR, 4.607; 95% CI, 1.057-20.090), hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (HR, 5.023; 95% CI, 1.921-13.136), lactate concentration (HR,15.721; 95% CI, 2.099-117.777), Interleukin-10 (HR, 3.551; 95% CI, 1.280-9.857) and C-reactive protein (HR, 5.275; 95% CI, 1.517-18.344) were associated with increased risk of poor outcome development. We also found that traditional Chinese medicine can significantly improve the patient\u0027s condition, which is conducive to the transformation from severe to mild. Conclusion. In summary, we firstly reported this single-centered, prospective and observational study for short-term outcome in severe patients with COVID-19. We found that cytokine storm and uncontrolled inflammation responses, liver, kidney, cardiac dysfunction may play important roles in final outcome of severe ill patients with COVID-19. Our study will provide clinicians to be benefit to rapidly estimate the likelihood risk of short-term poor outcome for severe patients.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, X.; Li, P.; Ma, L.; Liang, H.; Lei, J.; Li, W.; Wang, K.; Song, Y.; Li, S.; Yang, W.; Yang, C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fda9e88a710b43076bcf7e1e4cd67f64887d15a6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20078063v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyNzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe patients","short-term outcome","final outcome of severe ill patients","outcome groups","good outcome","severe ill diagnosis","likelihood risk of short-term poor outcome","increased risk of poor outcome development","confirmed COVID","decreased risk","observational study","prognostic risk factors","days","Wuhan","China","clinicians","higher levels of oxygen saturation","Results of multivariate Cox analyses","higher levels of leucocytes","multivariate Cox proportional hazard models","cardiac dysfunction","laboratory information","hazard ratios","lactate dehydrogenase","lactate concentration","hypersensitive cardiac troponin","arterial partial pressure of oxygen","liver","kidney","important roles","uncontrolled inflammation responses","prevalence of coexisting disorders","gender","baseline","cases","cytokine storm","confidence intervals","age","HRs","Union Hospital","data","CIs","clinical outcomes","patient\u0027s condition","traditional Chinese medicine","discharge","hand","transformation","treatment","blood urea nitrogen","creatine kinase-MB","C-reactive protein","significant differences","day of death","novel pneumonia","deaths","total bilirubin","research","summary","albumin","neutrophils","globulin","Interleukin","Conclusion","Objective","globe","Methods"],"language":"en"},

Senescence has been involved in chronic lung diseases, but its role in the acute phase is less known. Acute lung injury activates a large variety of pathogenetic mechanisms that can lead to respiratory insufficiency. In some cases, mechanical ventilation may help to maintain gas exchange, but positive airway pressures can cause regional overdistension of alveolar units and further damage. Here, we report that acute lung injury and alveolar overstretching activate a lung senescent program aimed to limit apoptosis. A systematic pooling of transcriptomic data from animal models of lung injury demonstrates the enrichment of a specific senescence signature. In a clinically relevant, murine model of acid aspiration and mechanical ventilation, we observed the activation of the Tp53/Cdkn1a (p21) senescence pathway, increases in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci in alveolar cells and markers of DNA damage, chromatin reorganization and changes in the nuclear envelope. Autopsy samples from lungs of critically ill patients showed the increase in senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Cell stretch per se was also able to activate the senescence response in an ex-vivo model. Absence of Cdkn1a decreased the senescent response, but worsened lung injury by a significant increase in apoptosis. In opposite, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir led to Cdkn1a overexpression and ameliorated cell apoptosis and lung injury. Collectively, these results suggest that acute injury promotes lung senescence. This response plays a protective role against acute lung injury in the short term, but its long-term consequences remain unexplored.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bl\u00E1zquez-Prieto, Jorge; Huidobro, Covadonga; L\u00F3pez-Alonso, In\u00E9s; Amado-Rodriguez, Laura; Mart\u00EDn-Vicente, Paula; L\u00F3pez-Mart\u00EDnez, Cecilia; Crespo, Irene; Pantoja, Cristina; Fern\u00E1ndez-Marcos, Pablo J; Serrano, Manuel; Sznajder, Jacob I; Albaiceta, Guillermo M","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5965d70bb52767a8249924db080bfa8c23f3e4f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.005983","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung senescence","Acute lung injury","acute injury","worsened lung injury","senescence response","animal models of lung injury","Different forms of lung injury","senescence pathways","lung senescent program","chronic lung diseases","senescence-associated heterochromatin foci","specific senescence signature","acute phase","senescent response","alveolar cells","alveolar overstretching","Cdkn1a overexpression","mechanical ventilation","ameliorated cell apoptosis","Absence of Cdkn1a","regional overdistension of alveolar units","significant increase","protective role","markers of DNA damage","murine model of acid aspiration","chromatin reorganization","positive airway pressures","changes","ritonavir","short term","enrichment","gas exchange","systematic pooling of transcriptomic data","ill patients","large variety of pathogenetic mechanisms","lopinavir","lungs","long-term consequences","activation","Tp53","p21","Autopsy samples","nuclear envelope","opposite","treatment","results","respiratory insufficiency","cases"],"language":"en"},

However, the importance of the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 for virus-induced pathologies, spreading and prognosis remains unknown. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle in human intestinal epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication and production of infectious de-novo virus particles. Importantly, we identified intestinal epithelial cells as the best culture model to propagate SARS-CoV-2. We found that viral infection elicited an extremely robust intrinsic immune response where, interestingly, type III interferon mediated response was significantly more efficient at controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread compared to type I interferon. Taken together, our data demonstrate that human intestinal epithelial cells are a productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggest that the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 may participate in the pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients by contributing in increasing patient viremia and by fueling an exacerbated cytokine response.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stanifer, Megan L.; Kee, Carmon; Cortese, Mirko; Triana, Sergio; Mukenhirn, Markus; Kraeusslich, Hans-Georg; Alexandrov, Theodore; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Boulant, Steeve","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2d313d1056cdedb86144598435934b564bc5abeb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.059667","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjsyOTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","enteric phase of SARS","human intestinal epithelial cells","productive site of SARS","comprehensive analysis of SARS","intestinal epithelium","targets cells","replication","virus-induced pathologies","respiratory infection","viral infection","type","interferon mediated response","COVID","novel therapeutic approaches","exacerbated cytokine response","lung epithelium","global approaches","robust intrinsic immune response","production of infectious de-novo virus particles","potential future emergence of novel pandemic viruses","colon-derived cell lines","primary non-transformed colon organoids","best culture model","lifecycle","unprecedented worldwide health problem","patients","increasing patient viremia","order","results","data","prognosis","evidence","importance"],"language":"en"},

The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time) forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly affect the case fatality rates for different countries.

Design: A cross-sectional survey Setting: Conducted with a nationally representative sample of UK adults within 48 hours of the UK Government advising the public to stop non-essential contact with others and all unnecessary travel. Participants: 2,108 adults living in the UK aged 18 years and over. Data were collected between March 17 and 18 2020. Main outcome measures: Descriptive statistics for all survey questions, including the number of respondents and the weighted percentages. Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic variation in: (1) adoption of social-distancing measures, (2) ability to work from home, and (3) willingness and (4) ability to self-isolate. Results Overall, 1,992 (94.2%) respondents reported taking at least one preventive measure: 85.8% washed their hands with soap more frequently; 56.5% avoided crowded areas and 54.5% avoided social events. Adoption of social-distancing measures was higher in those aged over 70 compared to younger adults aged 18 to 34 years (aOR:1.9; 95% CI:1.1 to 3.4). Those with the lowest household income were six times less likely to be able to work from home (aOR:0.16; 95% CI:0.09 to 0.26) and three times less likely to be able to self-isolate (aOR:0.31; 95% CI:0.16 to 0.58). Ability to self-isolate was also lower in black and minority ethnic groups (aOR:0.47; 95% CI:0.27 to 0.82). Willingness to self-isolate was high across all respondents. Conclusions The ability to adopt and comply with certain NPIs is lower in the most economically disadvantaged in society. Governments must implement appropriate social and economic policies to mitigate this. By incorporating these differences in NPIs among socio-economic subpopulations into mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, our modelling of epidemic outcomes and response to COVID-19 can be improved.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Atchison, Christina J; Bowman, Leigh; Vrinten, Charlotte; Redd, Rozlyn; Pristera, Philippa; Eaton, Jeffrey W; Ward, Helen","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad47f8d46f41eeb6559d89a1addba67699813a6a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050039","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszMTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["aOR","self-isolate","ability","UK Government","adoption of social","distancing measures","representative sample of UK adults","social events","UK adult population","number of respondents","times","younger adults","willingness","years","home","mathematical models of COVID","Main outcome measures","survey questions","certain NPIs","modelling of epidemic outcomes","cross-sectional survey Setting","behavioural responses","Descriptive statistics","socio-economic subpopulations","transmission dynamics","early phase","public","hours","risk perceptions","non-essential contact","minority ethnic groups","lowest household income","economic policies","sociodemographic variation","Design","differences","weighted percentages","Governments","Logistic regression","unnecessary travel","preventive measure","crowded areas","hands","Objective","soap","society","Participants","Conclusions","Data","Results"],"language":"en"},

Here, we map potential hotspots of viral sharing, using a phylogeographic model of the mammal-virus network, and projections of geographic range shifts for 3,870 mammal species under climate change and land use scenarios for the year 2070. Shifting mammal species are predicted to aggregate at high elevations, in biodiversity hotspots, and in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa, sharing novel viruses between 3,000 and 13,000 times.

Methods In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. Results Between March 13th and March 24th 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihoodratio (LR) \u002B 2.81 and LR- 0.16.

The objective of this study determines if it is feasible to use machine learning method to evaluate how much prediction results are close to original data related to Confirmed-Negative-Released-Death cases of Covid-19. For this purpose, a verification method is proposed in this paper that uses the concept of Deep-learning Neural Network. In this framework, Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are also assimilated finally for training the dataset and the prediction results are tally with the results predicted by clinical doctors. The prediction results are validated against the original data based on some predefined metric. The experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is useful in generating suitable results based on the critical disease outbreak. It also helps doctors to recheck further verification of virus by the proposed method. The outbreak of Coronavirus has the nature of exponential growth and so it is difficult to control with limited clinical persons for handling a huge number of patients with in a reasonable time. So it is necessary to build an automated model, based on machine learning approach, for corrective measure after the decision of clinical doctors. It could be a promising supplementary confirmation method for frontline clinical doctors.

However, the viral dynamics, host serologic responses, and their associations with clinical manifestations, have not been well described in prospective cohort. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort and enrolled 67 COVID-19 patients admitting between Jan 26 and Feb 5, 2020. Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool were tested periodically according to standardized case report form with final follow-up on February 27. The routes and duration of viral shedding, antibody response, and their associations with disease severity and clinical manifestations were systematically evaluated. Coronaviral particles in clinical specimens were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were 12 (3-38), 19 (5-37), and 18 (7-26) days in nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and stools, respectively. Only 13 urines (5.6%) and 12 plasmas (5.7%) were viral positive. Prolonged viral shedding was observed in severe patients than that of non-severe patients. Cough but not fever, aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory specimens, meanwhile the positive stool-RNA appeared to align with the proportion who concurrently had cough and sputum production, but not diarrhea. Typical coronaviral particles could be found directly in sputum by TEM. The anti-nucleocapsid-protein IgM started on day 7 and positive rate peaked on day 28, while that of IgG was on day 10 and day 49 after illness onset. IgM and IgG appear earlier, and their titers are significantly higher in severe patients than non-severe patients (p\u003C0.05). The weak responders for IgG had a significantly higher viral clearance rate than that of strong responders (p= 0.011). Conclusions Nasopharyngeal, sputum and stools rather than blood and urine, were the major shedding routes for SARS-CoV-2, and meanwhile sputum had a prolonged viral shedding. Symptom cough seems to be aligned with viral shedding in clinical respiratory and fecal specimens. Stronger antibody response was associated with delayed viral clearance and disease severity.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tan, Wenting; Lu, Yanqiu; Zhang, Juan; Wang, Jing; Dan, Yunjie; Tan, Zhaoxia; He, Xiaoqing; Qian, Chunfang; Sun, Qiangzhong; Hu, Qingli; Liu, Honglan; Ye, Sikuan; Xiang, Xiaomei; Zhou, Yi; Zhang, Wei; Guo, Yanzhi; Wang, Xiu-Hua; He, Weiwei; Wan, Xing; Sun, Fengming; Wei, Quanfang; Chen, Cong; Pan, Guangqiang; Xia, Jie; Mao, Qing; Chen, Yaokai; Deng, Guohong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0b5a3f376d0bf92fe46ee15bfe794fd9046a08a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042382","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjszNjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TEM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["duration of viral shedding","Prolonged viral shedding","Clinical specimens","viral dynamics","RNA shedding","clinical respiratory specimens","non-severe patients","delayed viral clearance","clinical manifestations","higher viral clearance rate","sputum production","major shedding routes","SARS-CoV","IgG","fecal specimens","disease severity","positive rate","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","positive stool-RNA","associations","blood","median duration of SARS","pandemic of coronavirus disease","COVID","nasopharyngeal swabs","stools","Conclusions Nasopharyngeal","prospective cohort","TEM","Symptom cough","Stronger antibody response","Typical coronaviral particles","strong responders","weak responders","anti-nucleocapsid-protein IgM","standardized case report form","host serologic responses","final follow-up","transmission electron microscopy","titers","days","proportion","illness onset","Methods","diarrhea","plasmas","world","urines"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we analyzed genome-wide codon usage patterns in 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different geo-locations (countries) by utilizing different CUB measurements. Nucleotide and di-nucleotide compositions displayed bias toward A/U content in all codon positions and CpU-ended codons preference, respectively. Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) analysis revealed 8 common putative preferred codons among all the 13 isolates. Interestingly, all of the latter codons are A/U-ended (U-ended: 7, A-ended: 1). Cluster analysis (based on RSCU values) was performed and showed comparable results to the phylogenetic analysis (based on their whole genome sequences) indicating that the CUB pattern may reflect the evolutionary relationship between the tested isolates. To investigate the force (mutation and/or selection) influencing the pattern of CUB in SARS-CoV-2 coding sequences, we employed the following; (i). Effective number of codons (ENc), (ii). ENc-GC3 plot, (iii). Neutrality plot, and (iv) Codon adaptation index (CAI). According to their results, natural selection and/or other factors (not investigated in this study) may be the dominant force driving SARS-CoV-2 CUB. It is also worth mentioning that, by using the most expressed genes in human lung tissues as a reference set, some viral genes such as Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, ORF7a protein, and surface glycoprotein had high CAI values which may indicate for selection force acting on their codon usage, as they play important roles in viral assembly and may help viruses avoid the host immune system. The outcome of our study may help in understanding the underlying factors involved in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the interactions with their host. Also, it may aid in vaccine design strategies.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anwar, Ali Mostafa; Khodary, Saif M.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3591e84de6850216abf0e6a6de9a627255ed4d6b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.019463","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CAI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","codon positions","evolution of SARS","CUB pattern","pattern of CUB","Relative Synonymous Codon Usage","selection force","codons preference","genome-wide codon usage patterns","Codon adaptation index","different CUB measurements","RSCU values","viral genes","phylogenetic analysis","Cluster analysis","viruses","genome sequences","tested isolates","dominant force","U content","Effective number of codons","present study","common putative preferred codons","high CAI values","ENc-GC3 plot","expressed genes","viral assembly","causative agent of Coronavirus disease","coding sequences","nucleotide compositions","infectious disease","comparable results","underlying factors","Neutrality plot","different geo-locations","World Health Organization","host immune system","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","countries","surface glycoprotein","ORF7a protein","human lung tissues","reference set","Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein","CpU","evolutionary relationship","important roles","pandemic","bias","COVID","vaccine design strategies","following","interactions","mutation","outcome"],"language":"en"},

It is important to have an estimate of the current state of COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. to develop informed public health strategies. Methods: We estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03/01/2020) in the U.S. from cases imported directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. Detection and quarantine of individual COVID-19 cases in the U.S before 03/01/2020 were also taken into account. We. A SEIR model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in Wuhan area and in the U.S. Results: With the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%CI 2,054-24,241) as of 03/01/2020 if no intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. Assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%CI 107-2,474).

However, the extensive applications of GTs in glycosides formation are limited due to their requirements of expensive nucleotide diphosphate (NDP)-sugars or NDP as the substrates. Here, in an effort to characterize flexible GTs for glycodiversification of natural products, we isolated a cDNA, designated as OcUGT1 from Ornithogalum caudatum, which encoded a flavonoid GT that was able to catalyze the trans-glycosylation reactions, allowing the formation of glycosides without the additions of NDP-sugars or NDP. In addition, OcUGT1 was observed to exhibit additional five types of functions, including classical sugar transfer reaction and three reversible reactions namely NDP-sugar synthesis, sugars exchange and aglycons exchange reactions, as well as enzymatic hydrolysis reaction, suggesting OcUGT1 displays both glycosyltransferase and glycosidase activities. Expression profiles revealed that the expression of OcUGT1 was development-dependent and affected by environmental factors. The unusual multifunctionality of OcUGT1 broadens the applicability of OcUGT1, thereby generating diverse carbohydrate-containing structures.","publish_time":"2018-04-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yuan, Shuai; Yin, Sen; Liu, Ming; Kong, Jian-Qiang","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/083d4f33c62061390ac7dafcc4e9a4e44518df3f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/883d9e249c839788d9c21c7da412175a1314c7c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5897352.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5897352/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NDP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of OcUGT1","applicability of OcUGT1","additions of NDP","NDP-sugar synthesis","unusual multifunctionality of OcUGT1","sugars exchange","reversible reactions","aglycons exchange reactions","trans-glycosylation reactions","glycosides formation","formation of glycosides","flexible GTs","extensive applications of GTs","glycosylation of diverse molecules","classical sugar transfer reaction","diverse carbohydrate","Expression profiles","enzymatic hydrolysis reaction","bidirectional biocatalysts","glycodiversification of natural products","types of functions","requirements of expensive nucleotide diphosphate","development-dependent","Ornithogalum caudatum","cDNA","flavonoid GT","effort","Glycosyltransferases","glycosidase activities","environmental factors","structures","substrates"],"language":"en"},

The RNA as a molecular chaperone (chaperna) activity is intrinsic to some ribozymes and is operational during viral infections. Our purpose was to test whether influenza hemagglutinin (HA) can be assembled in a soluble, trimeric, and immunologically activating conformation by means of an RNA molecular chaperone (chaperna) activity. An RNA-interacting domain (RID) from the host being immunized was selected as a docking tag for RNA binding, which served as a transducer for the chaperna function for de novo folding and trimeric assembly of RID-HA1. Mutations that affect tRNA binding greatly increased the soluble aggregation defective in trimer assembly, suggesting that RNA interaction critically controls the kinetic network in the folding/assembly pathway. Immunization of mice resulted in strong hemagglutination inhibition and high titers of a neutralizing antibody, providing sterile protection against a lethal challenge and confirming the immunologically relevant HA conformation. The results may be translated into a rapid response to a new influenza pandemic. The harnessing of the novel chaperna described herein with immunologically tailored antigen-folding functions should serve as a robust prophylactic and diagnostic tool for viral infections.\u2014Yang, S.

The MutPred, Provean, and PMUT bioinformatic tools were found to have the highest performance in predicting the pathogenicity effects of all 18 characterized missense variants in PITX2, all with sensitivity and specificity \u003E93%. Applying these three programs to assess the likely pathogenicity of 13 previously uncharacterized PITX2 missense variants predicted 12/13 variants as deleterious, except A30V which was predicted as benign variant for all programs. Molecular modeling of the PITX2 homoedomain predicts that of the 31 known PITX2 variants, L54Q, F58L, V83F, V83L, W86C, W86S, and R91P alter PITX2\u2019s structure. In contrast, the remaining 24 variants are not predicted to change PITX2\u2019s structure. The results of molecular modeling, performed on all the PITX2 missense mutations located in the homeodomain, were compared with the findings of eight protein stability programs. CUPSAT was found to be the most reliable in predicting the effect of missense mutations on PITX2 stability. Our results showed that for PITX2, and likely other members of this homeodomain transcription factor family, MutPred, Provean, PMUT, molecular modeling, and CUPSAT can reliably be used to predict PITX2 missense variants pathogenicity.","publish_time":"2018-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Seifi, Morteza; Walter, Michael A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c78f14566e94220797611e80ca9136e070bbe45.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5903617.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5903617/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozk4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMUT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PITX2 structure","PITX2 missense variants pathogenicity","PITX2 stability","known PITX2 variants","likely pathogenicity of PITX2 variants","PITX2 homoedomain","PITX2 missense mutations","uncharacterized PITX2 missense variants","impact of variants","effect of missense mutations","results of molecular modeling","pathogenicity effects","s structure","Provean","MutPred","reliable bioinformatics tools","results of bioinformatics predictions","protein stability programs","CUPSAT","PMUT bioinformatic tools","homeodomain transcription factor family","F58L","V83F","members","L54Q","W86C","V83L","W86S","R91P","genetic disorders","A30V","findings","Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome","highest performance","benign variant","sensitivity","function","contrast","specificity"],"language":"en"},

However, the characteristics of cancer patients with CAP admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) are not well established. In a retrospective observational study, patients admitted to a London university hospital ICU between January 2006 and October 2011 with a primary diagnosis of CAP were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected from the ICU and hospital pathology databases. The analysis included 96 patients with CAP, 19 of whom had an existing diagnosis of cancer. Patients with cancer had a longer median time interval between hospital and ICU admission (1 vs 2 days, p = 0.049). On admission to ICU, there were no differences in white cell count, C-reactive protein, clotting, renal function, liver function, heart rate, temperature, systolic blood pressure or oxygenation index between patients with or without cancer. However, patients with cancer had significantly lower haemoglobin levels (median 8.6 vs 10.0 g/dl, p = 0.010) and lowest diastolic blood pressure (median 40 vs 50 mmHg, p = 0.026), and higher sodium levels (median 142 vs 139 mmol/l), p = 0.020), APACHE II (median 25 vs 20, p = 0.009), SAPS II (median 51 vs 43, p = 0.039) and SOFA (median 12 vs 9, p = 0.018) scores. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation or renal support, the duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU or hospital length of stay. Patients with cancer were more likely to receive vasopressors (89.5% vs 63.6%, p = 0.030) and had increased ICU (68.4% vs 31.2%, p = 0.004) and hospital (78.9% vs 33.8%, p = 0.001) mortality. The limitations of this study are its relatively small sample size and those associated with the retrospective study design. In conclusion, cancer patients with CAP had an increased risk of death that was associated with increased illness severity and prevalence of septic shock at the time of ICU admission, suggesting there may be a delay in recognition for the need for intensive care support in these patients.","publish_time":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jos\u00E9, Ricardo J.

Human milk IgG originates mainly from blood, therefore a SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibody (Ab) response in milk would be expected (1). However, IgG comprises only ~2% of milk Ab, with most milk Abs originating from mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (1). Therefore, the extent of the milk immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is unknown (2). This response is critical for infants and young children, who tend not to suffer greatly from COVID-19 pathology but are likely responsible for significant virus transmission (3-5). Perhaps even more significant is the fact that milk Abs could be purified and used as a COVID-19 therapeutic, given they would likely be of the secretory (s) class and highly resistant to proteolytic degradation in the respiratory tissue (2, 6). In this preliminary report, 15 milk samples obtained from donors previously-infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as 10 negative control samples obtained prior to December 2019 were tested for reactivity to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein by ELISAs measuring IgA, IgG, IgM, and secretory Ab. Eighty percent of samples obtained post-COVID-19 exhibited IgA reactivity, and all these samples were also positive for secretory Ab reactivity, suggesting the IgA is predominantly sIgA. COVID-19 group mean OD values of undiluted milk were significantly greater for IgA (p\u003C0.0001), secretory-type Abs (p\u003C0.0001), and IgG (p=0.017), but not for IgM, compared to pre-pandemic group mean values. Overall, these data indicate that there is strong sIgA-dominant SARS-CoV-2 immune response in human milk after infection in the majority of individuals, and that a comprehensive study of this response is highly warranted.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fox, A.; Marino, J.; Amanat, F.; Krammer, F.; Hahn-Holbrook, J.; Zolla-Pazner, S.; Powell, R.

We prospectively enrolled a cohort of 41 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome on mechanical ventilation. Patients blood was obtained at enrollment and outcome measures were liberation from mechanical ventilation and hospital-free days. We determined the expression levels of 44 circulating cytokines/chemokines and found 13 of them associated with worse outcomes. After correcting for multiple comparisons/false discovery rate, only one chemokine (CCL19) remained significantly associated with outcomes (p=0.009). Although not described in association with COVID19, this chemokine was previously found elevated in an animal model of SARS-CoV. Moreover, CCL19 seems to be relevant for bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) maintenance and for lung immunity to influenza virus.

We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P\u003C0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed.

The WHO has more recently formally named the 2019-nCoV as coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19). Within one month, the novel coronavirus rapidly spread across the whole of China through droplet transmission and contact transmission, and the reported number of confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrated a rising trend. Radiological examinations, especially computed tomography CT, were confirmed as effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of infected cases. Reports stated that many radiologists and technologists were being infected when examining patients with COVID-19. In order to clarify the imaging features of COVID-19 and reduce the infection risk of medical personnel in radiology departments, we summarized the experience on radiological examinations and infection prevention for COVID-19, aiming to guide virus prevention, diagnosis and control within radiology departments.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Jinli; Liu, Yaou; Fu, Haihong; Gao, Jianbo; Zhao, Xin; Zheng, Junhui; Sun, Wenge; Ma, Xinwu; Feng, Ji; Liang, Pan; Wu, Aiqin; Liu, Jie; Wang, Yun; Geng, Pengfei; Chen, Yong; Li, Hongjun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c75fe1f4c9f38f76925b048dc3a97e532a6e16da.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352621120300188; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352621120300188?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["novel coronavirus","coronavirus Diseases","imaging features of COVID","reported number of confirmed COVID","infection prevention","radiology departments","Radiological examinations","diagnosis of infected cases","nCoV","China","contact transmission","droplet transmission","cluster of patients","virus prevention","infection risk of medical personnel","experience","emerging pneumonia of unknown etiology","computed tomography CT","screening","control","effective methods","Wuhan city","technologists","radiologists","World Health Organization","Laboratory examination","rising trend","order","Reports","month","Abstract"],"language":"en"},

Design Retrospective case series. Setting A COVID-19 ward of a secondary Hospital in Wuhan, China. Participants Consecutively hospitalized COVID-19 patients between Jan 3, 2020 and Feb 27, 2020. Outcomes were followed up to discharge or death. Results Of 121 patients included, 66 (54.6%) were males. The median age was 59 (IQR: 46 to 67) years, and hypertension (33 patients; 27.3%) the leading comorbidity. Lymphopenia (83 of 115 patients; 72.2%) frequently occurred and then normalized on day 4 (IQR: 3 to 6) after admission in the survivors, with lung lesion absorbed gradually on day 8 (IQR: 6 to10) after onset (33 of 57 patients; 57.9%). The real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for SARS-CoV-2 were positive in 78 (78/108; 72.2%) patients, and a false-negative RT-PCR occurred in 15 (13.9%) patients. Hypoxemia occurred in 94 (94/117; 80.3%) patients, and supplemental oxygen was given in 88 (72.7%) patients, and mon-invasive or invasive ventilation in 20 (16.5%) cases. Corticosteroid use might link to death. The case fatality rates were 4.4% (one of 23 patients), 29.3% (12/41), 22.8% (13/57) or 45% (9/20) for patients with moderate, severe, critical illness or on ventilator. The length of hospital stay was 14 (IQR: 10 to 20) days, and selfcare ability worsened in 21 patients (21/66; 31.8%) cases. Patients over 60 years were most likely to have poorer outcomes, and increasing in age by one-year increased risk for death by 18% (CI: 1.04-1.32). Conclusions In management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, especially the elderly with hypertension, close monitoring and appropriate supportive treatment should be taken earlier and aggressively to prevent from developing severe or critical illness. Corticosteroid use might link to death. Repeated RT-PCR tests or novel detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 should be adopted to improve diagnostic efficiency.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, H.; Lu, Y.; Lv, Q.; Wu, X.; Hu, T.; Wang, K.; Liu, Y.; Hu, Y.; Yu, L.; Fei, H.; Ba, Z.; Lin, X.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c7d5729de41f77ab8f7ee793830ccf560ce3c94.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.12.20099739v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lymphopenia"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["management of patients","IQR","SARS-CoV","death risk factors","case fatality rates","Repeated RT-PCR tests","false-negative RT-PCR","hypertension","critical illness","years","Corticosteroid use","cases","secondary Hospital","Design Retrospective case series","median age","poorer outcomes","hospitalized COVID","invasive ventilation","year increased risk","length of hospital stay","novel detection methods","close monitoring","real-time polymerase chain reaction","assays","appropriate supportive treatment","Wuhan","elderly","ward","pneumonia","lung lesion","survivors","China","days","to10","selfcare ability","ventilator","Objectives","Participants","Conclusions","onset","admission","supplemental oxygen","discharge","leading comorbidity","diagnostic efficiency","Results","Lymphopenia","males","Hypoxemia"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we compare outcomes for two northern Italian regions which had almost simultaneous initial outbreaks: Lombardy, which had a patient-centered approach that relied on primary care physicians and hospital care, and Veneto, which focused on community-based diagnosis and care. Methods We used numerator and denominator data from public Italian government sources to calculate reported rates of COVID-19 testing/1000, COVID-19 cases/100,000 overall and for health care workers (HCWs) and non-HCWs, deaths per 100,000, and the percent of cases admitted to hospitals and ICUs for February 24-April 1, 2020. Results As of April 1, 2020, Lombardy experienced 44,733 cases and 7,539 deaths; for Veneto, the corresponding values were 9,625 and 499. The cumulative case rate was 445/100,000 for Lombardy and 196/100,000 for Veneto, a 2.3-fold difference. Mortality rates were 7.5 times higher in Lombardy than in Veneto (75/100,000 and 10/100,000, respectively). Cumulative rates of testing were nearly twice as high in Veneto and were 2.7 times higher in the first week of the epidemic. In Lombardy, 51.5% of patients were admitted, including, 5.2% to intensive care units; for Veneto, the corresponding figures were 25.1% and 4.3%, respectively. HCWs account for 14.3% of all cases in Lombardy compared with 4.4% in Veneto. In Lombardy, the rate among HCWs was 19.1 times higher than in the general population (6,924 versus 362 per 100,000), while in Veneto it was 3.9 times higher (676 versus 172/100,000). Discussion The community-based approach in Veneto appears to be associated with substantially reduced rates of cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and infection in HCWs compared with the patient-centered approach in Lombardy. Our findings suggest that the impact of COVID-19 can be reduced through strong and aggressive public health efforts to confirm and isolate cases and contacts in a timely way and to minimize unnecessary contact between HCWs and cases through home-based testing and pro-active home follow-up.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Binkin, Nancy; Salmaso, Stefania; Michieletto, Federica; Russo, Francesca","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/32c2180a0dab56e736d58b505e741ac4c2110f2d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060707","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Veneto","Lombardy"],"keyphrases":["Veneto","Lombardy","rates of cases","isolate cases","times higher","percent of cases","non-HCWs","HCWs account","health care workers","hospital care","deaths","Cumulative rates of testing","reported rates of COVID","community-based approach","Mortality rates","impact of COVID","public health services","primary care physicians","intensive care units","patient-centered approach","aggressive public health efforts","home-based testing","community-based diagnosis","public Italian government sources","northern Italian regions","cumulative case rate","corresponding values","corresponding figures","denominator data","timely way","unnecessary contact","pandemic","numerator","simultaneous initial outbreaks","pro-active home follow-up","outcomes","contacts","organization","curative","infection","hospitalizations","overriding national strategy","Methods","hospitals","week","general population","Discussion","Introduction Italy","response","findings","ICUs","fold difference","epidemic","paper","Results","patients"],"language":"en"},

Two previous case series from China have suggested that cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, but the reports were limited by small numbers and few clinical information. Objective: To study clinical characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Four designated COVID-16 hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Medical records of 67 cancer patients admitted to hospitals between Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020 were included. Measurements: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected. Survival data of the cohort was cut-off on Mar 10, 2020. Results: Of the 67 patients (median age: 66 years), the median age of patients who had severe illness was older than that of patients who had mild symptoms (P\u003C0.001). Forty-three (64.2%) patients had other concurrent chronic diseases, and the proportion of severe patients had co-morbidities was higher than patients with mild disease (P=0.004). Twenty-three (34.3%) patients were still at the anticancer treatment phase, but no tumour progression and recurrence was observed for all the patients during the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. About 70% of these patients had fever (n=53, 79.1%) and/or cough (n=50, 74.6%). Lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19, and 39 (58.2%) patients have been discharged. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) with COVID-19 was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5/15). We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095). Limitation: This is a retrospective study with only 67 cases from four hospitals. And some specific clinical information was insufficient. Conclusion: This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. The tendency of poor prognosis was more obvious in patients at anticancer treatment phase. We should pay more intensive attentions to cancer patients infected with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, H.-Y.; Wang, L.-W.; Chen, Y.-Y.; Shen, X.-K.; Wang, Q.; Yan, Y.-Q.; Yu, Y.; Wu, Q.; Wang, X.; Zhong, Y.-H.; Chua Lee Kiang, M.; Xie, C.-H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/eb7b4ccca9d355e7ccc6cf801de47abb97ac6e99.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.21.20037127v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsxMzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["outcomes of cancer patients","proportion of severe patients","median age of patients","treatment of COVID","designated COVID","highest proportion COVID","higher risk of COVID","Lung cancer","anticancer treatment phase","treatment data","common cancer type","higher proportion of severe cases","hospitals","pneumonia","Retrospective study","severe illness","follow-up phase","clinical characteristics","specific clinical information","median age of survivors","better prognosis","poorer prognosis","China","tendency of poor prognosis","mild disease","main laboratory","resulted deaths","mild symptoms","Survival data","global pandemic of coronavirus disease","increased C-reactive protein","co-morbidities","Wuhan","procalcitonin","years","tumour progression","concurrent chronic diseases","Hubei province","small numbers","Demographic","Medical records","previous case series","intensive attentions","present","cohort","cut-off","reports","Participants","Measurements","recurrence","Lymphocytopenia","Objective","Setting","Limitation","Conclusion","fever","Background","cough","Results"],"language":"en"},

In wild-type hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers bronchopneumonia and a strong inflammatory response in the lungs with neutrophil infiltration and edema. We further assess SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology in hamsters by micro-CT alike used in clinical practice. Finally, we identify an exuberant innate response as key player in immune pathogenesis, in which STAT2 signaling plays a double-edged role, driving severe lung injury on the one hand, yet restricting systemic virus dissemination on the other.

There is no evidence that BCG vaccination, smoking prevalence, and PM25 pollution have any link to COVID-19 mortality. These estimation results are robust to alternative specifications and after controlling for confounding factors and excluding outliers.

Abstract Emerging infectious diseases like Covid-19 cause a major threat to global health. When confronted with new pathogens, individuals generate several beliefs about the epidemic phenomenon. Many studies have shown that individual protective behaviors largely depend on these beliefs. Due to the absence of treatment and vaccine against these emerging pathogens, the relation between these beliefs and these behaviors represents a crucial issue for public health policies. In the premises of the Covid-19 pandemic, several preliminary studies have highlighted a delay in the perception of risk by individuals, which potentially holds back the implementing of the necessary precautionary measures: people underestimated the risks associated with the virus, and therefore also the importance of complying with sanitary guidelines. During the peak of the pandemic, the salience of the threat and of the risk of mortality could then have transformed the way people generate their beliefs. This potentially leads to upheavals in the way they understand the world. Here, we propose to explore the evolution of beliefs and behaviors during the Covid-19 crisis, using the theory of predictive coding and the theory of terror management, two influential frameworks in cognitive science and in social psychology.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bottemanne, Hugo; Morla\u00E0s, Orph\u00E9e; Schmidt, Liane; Fossati, Philippe","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bc2977217bb477bf5a087b9d382ba788271a2bd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300981; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300981?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["the pandemic","the threat","the implementing","the evolution","the salience","In the premises","to the absence","using the theory","During the peak","behaviors during the Covid","delay in the perception","people underestimated the risks associated with the virus","the relation between these beliefs","therefore also the importance","the necessary precautionary measures","This potentially leads to upheavals in the way they understand the world","transformed the way people generate their beliefs","individuals generate several beliefs about the epidemic phenomenon","individus","nombreuses croyances","\u00E9volution des croyances","these behaviors represents","in social psychology","vaccine against these emerging pathogens","major threat to global health","Abstract Emerging infectious diseases like Covid","importance des mesures","perception du risque","comportements individuels","two influential frameworks in cognitive science","several preliminary studies","When confronted with new pathogens","complying with sanitary guidelines","enjeu crucial","Many studies","saillance de la menace","absence de traitement","menace majeure","th\u00E9orie de la gestion","risque de mortalit\u00E9","sant\u00E9 mondiale","\u00E9tudes pr\u00E9liminaires","pic de la pand\u00E9mie","pr\u00E9misses de la pand\u00E9mie","which potentially holds","crucial issue for public health policies","nouveaux agents pathog\u00E8nes","mesures de pr\u00E9caution n\u00E9cessaires","th\u00E9orie du codage pr\u00E9dictif","politiques de sant\u00E9 publique","shown that individual protective behaviors largely depend","cause","terror management","mortality could then","predictive coding","highlighted","treatment","crisis","sciences cognitives","conceptions influentes","terreur","informations associ\u00E9es","propos du ph\u00E9nom\u00E8ne \u00E9pid\u00E9mique","place","tendance","maladies infectieuses \u00E9mergentes","difficult\u00E9","retard","psychologie sociale","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","protection","mani\u00E8re","risques associ\u00E9s","fa\u00E7on","raison","pr\u00E9vention","bouleversements","explorer","crise","monde"],"language":"fr"},

Objectives: Here we investigate the prevalence of loss of smell and taste among COVID-19 diagnosed individuals and we identify the combination of symptoms, besides loss of smell and taste, most likely to correspond to a positive COVID-19 diagnosis in non-severe cases. Design: Community survey. Setting and Participants: Subscribers of RADAR COVID-19, an app that was launched for use among the UK general population asking about COVID-19 symptoms. Main Exposure: Loss of smell and taste. Main Outcome Measures: COVID-19. Results: Between 24 and 29 March 2020, 1,573,103 individuals reported their symptoms via the app; 26% reported suffering from one or more symptoms of COVID-19. Of those, n=1702 reported having had a RT-PCR COVID-19 test and gave full report on symptoms including loss of smell and taste; 579 were positive and 1123 negative. In this subset, we find that loss of smell and taste were present in 59% of COVID-19 positive individuals compared to 18% of those negative to the test, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 diagnosis of OR[95%CI]=6.59[5.25; 8.27], P= 1.90x10-59 . We also find that a combination of loss of smell and taste, fever, persistent cough, fatigue, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite is predictive of COVID-19 positive test with sensitivity 0.54[0.44; 0.63], specificity 0.86[0.80; 0.90], ROC-AUC 0.77[0.72; 0.82] in the test set, and cross-validation ROC-AUC 0.75[0.72; 0.77]. When applied to the 410,598 individuals reporting symptoms but not formally tested, our model predicted that 13.06%[12.97%;13.15] of these might have been already infected by the virus. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study suggests that loss of taste and smell is a strong predictor of having been infected by the COVID-19 virus. Also, the combination of symptoms that could be used to identify and isolate individuals includes anosmia, fever, persistent cough, diarrhoea, fatigue, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. This is particularly relevant to healthcare and other key workers in constant contact with the public who have not yet been tested for COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Menni, Cristina; Valdes, Ana; Freydin, Maxim B; Ganesh, Sajaysurya; El-Sayed Moustafa, Julia; Visconti, Alessia; Hysi, Pirro; Bowyer, Ruth C E; Mangino, Massimo; Falchi, Mario; Wolf, Jonathan; Steves, Claire; Spector, Tim","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1e48223ccda9ec1fa91dc5f2348e40c217c513e7.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20048421","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyMjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Community","UK"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["symptoms of COVID","positive COVID","loss of taste","loss of smell","predictive of COVID","ongoing COVID","combination of loss","loss of appetite","prevalence of loss","Subscribers of RADAR COVID","RT-PCR COVID","positive individuals","combination of symptoms","infected individuals","positive test","isolate individuals","diagnosed individuals","test set","fatigue","diarrhoea","persistent cough","fever","abdominal pain","diagnosis","virus","cross-validation ROC-AUC","Main Exposure","Main Outcome Measures","key workers","need of extensive bio-specimen testing","anosmia","constant contact","UK general population","healthcare","use","non-severe cases","study","report","public","Relevance","epidemic","Participants","infections","odds ratio","strong predictor","sensitivity","Design","Community survey","Conclusions","suffering","Importance","strategy","90x10","Objectives","subset","Results","specificity","model"],"language":"en"},

Methods: This observational study included data from all patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the Hankou Hospital, Wuhan, China between January 5 and March 8, 2020. Data were extracted from clinical and laboratory records. Follow-up was cutoff on March 8, 2020. Results: A total of 274 patients, 75 with hypertension and 199 without hypertension, were included in the analysis. Patients with hypertension were older and were more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease than patients without hypertension. Moreover, patients with hypertension tended to have higher positive COVID-19 PCR detection rates. Patients with hypertension who had previously taken ACEI/ARB drugs for antihypertensive treatment have an increased tendency to develop severe pneumonia after infection with SARS-COV-2 (P = 0.064). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients with hypertension were significantly older and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease. Patients with hypertension who had taken ACEI/ARB drugs for antihypertensive treatment have an increased tendency to develop severe pneumonia after infection with SARS-COV-2.

With over 200,000 confirmed cases to date, this pandemic continues to expand, spurring research to discover vaccines and therapies. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for this disease. It initiates entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S). Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to ACE2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells, presenting a new modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptide-based binders are an attractive solution to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contact interface. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently solved ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-RBD co-crystal structure, we observed that the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD) \u03B11 helix is important for binding SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Using automated fast-flow peptide synthesis, we chemically synthesized a 23-mer peptide fragment of the ACE2 PD \u03B11 helix composed entirely of proteinogenic amino acids. Chemical synthesis of this human derived sequence was complete in 1.5 hours and after work up and isolation \u003E20 milligrams of pure material was obtained. Bio-layer interferometry revealed that this peptide specifically associates with the SARS-CoV-2-RBD with low nanomolar affinity. This peptide binder to SARS-CoV-2-RBD provides new avenues for COVID-19 treatment and diagnostic modalities by blocking the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with ACE2 and thus precluding virus entry into human cells.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, G.; Pomplun, S.; Loftis, A.

We implemented a \u0022care map\u0022, as a standardized multidisciplinary approach to improve patients monitoring using: uniform patient selection for ICU admission, a low-PEEP strategy and a pharmacologic strategic thromboembolism management. Methods A standardized protocol for managing COVID-19 patients and ICU admissions was implemented through accurate Early Warning Score (EWS) monitoring and thromboembolism prophylaxis at hospital admission. Dyspnea, mental confusion or SpO2 less than 85% were criteria for ICU admission. Ventilation approach employed low PEEP values (about 10 cmH2O in presence of lung compliance \u003E 40 mL/cmH2O) and FiO2 as needed. In presence of lower lung compliance (\u003C 40 mL/cmH2O) PEEP value was increased to about 14 cmH2O. Results From March 16th to April 12nd 2020, 41 COVID-19 patients were admitted to our ICU from a total of 310 patients. 83% (34) of them needed mechanical ventilation. The ventilation approach chosen employed low PEEP value based on BMI (PEEP 11\u002B/- 3.8 (10-12) cmH2O if BMI \u003C 30 Kg/m2; PEEP 15\u002B/- 3.26 (12-18) cmH2O if BMI \u003E30 Kg/m2). To date, ten patients (24%) died, four (9.7%) received mechanical ventilation, two were transferred to another hospital and 25 (60.9%) were discharged from ICU after a median of nine days. Discussion A multimodal approach for COVID-19 patients is mandatory. The knowledge of this multi-organ disease is growing rapidly, requiring improvements in the standard of care. Our approach implements an accurate pre-ICU monitoring and strict selection for ICU admission, and allows to reduce mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and mortality.

Lanaken is situated in the Belgian province with the highest COVID-19 prevalence. participants: residents (N=108) and staff members (N=93) of the nursing home outcomes: PCR, IgM and IgG results: the prevalence of COVID-19, based on PCR test was 34% (N=40) for residents and 13% (N=11) for staff members, respectively. Of the residents, 13% showed positive IgM results and 15% positive IgG results. In 17% of the residents, at least one of the antibodies was positive.

We compare up-to-date, real-time SARS-CoV-2 cases and death measurements from public databases to air pollution data monitored across over 120 sites in different regions. We found that the levels of some markers of poor air quality, nitrogen oxides and ozone, are associated with COVID-19 lethality in different English regions.

Alongside COVID-19, diabetes is a long-standing global epidemic. The diabetes population has been reported to suffer adverse outcomes if infected by COVID-19. The aim was to summarise information and resources available on diabetes and COVID-19, highlighting special measures that individuals with diabetes need to follow. Methods A search using keywords \u201CCOVID-19\u201D and \u201CDiabetes\u201D was performed using different sources, including PubMed and World Health Organization. Results COVID-19 may enhance complications in individuals with diabetes through an imbalance in angiotension-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activation pathways leading to an inflammatory response. ACE2 imbalance in the pancreas causes acute \u03B2-cell dysfunction and a resultant hyperglycemic state. These individuals may be prone to worsened COVID-19 complications including vasculopathy, coagulopathy as well as psychological stress. Apart from general preventive measures, remaining hydrated, monitoring blood glucose regularly and monitoring ketone bodies in urine if on insulin is essential. All this while concurrently maintaining physical activity and a healthy diet. Different supporting entities are being set up to help this population. Conclusion COVID-19 is a top priority. It is important to remember that a substantial proportion of the world\u0027s population is affected by other co-morbidities such as diabetes. These require special attention during this pandemic to avoid adding on to the burden of countries\u0027 healthcare systems.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cuschieri, Sarah; Grech, Stephan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/274b3921b824ee68e17a618d98299cdc8d440708.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1056872720303962; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1056872720303962?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjsyOTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diabetes population","worsened COVID","Results COVID","Conclusion COVID","individuals","complications","ACE2 imbalance","special measures","world\u0027s population","different sources","special attention","monitoring ketone bodies","World Health Organization","general preventive measures","Different supporting entities","acute \u03B2-cell dysfunction","pancreas","blood glucose","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","activation pathways","urine","PubMed","enzyme","vasculopathy","Abstract Background","resultant hyperglycemic state","resources available","insulin","coagulopathy","substantial proportion","information","angiotension","co-morbidities","burden of countries\u0027 healthcare systems","physical activity","healthy diet","inflammatory response","Methods","search","keywords","long-standing global epidemic","psychological stress","adverse outcomes","aim","pandemic","storm","priority"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset. Results: The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile).

Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidemic. Thus, serious supervision of domestic transport networks is warranted even after restricting international migration.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pujari, Bhalchandra S; Shekatkar, Snehal M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6fa5d6c8514f9b7840bd59ee3295eee7360aadeb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035386","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["populations of individual cities","railway networks","domestic transportation","empirical transportation networks","existing models","international migration","serious supervision of domestic transport networks","SIR model","account populations","reliable epidemiological modeling","efficient hybrid approach","crucial ways","self-consistent determination of coupling parameters","coronavirus","incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays","turn","nCov","urgent necessity","Indian aviation","COVID","results project","significant population","ongoing pandemic","days","onset of epidemic","treatment"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin).

Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4\u00B115.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15\u00B117.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217). Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.","publish_time":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Yu; Luo, Sihui; Zheng, Xueying; Ling, Ping; Yue, Tong; Liu, Zhirong; Weng, Jianping","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a09c1ad0f05bbcc256cd667ad7411e6690134370.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024661","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjszNTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Spearman"],"organizations":["Baidu Migration","Major Public Health Emergencies"],"locations":["Shenzhen"],"keyphrases":["Hefei vs Shenzhen","different patterns of population migration","proportion of population inflow","cities","Aggregated data of population migration","epidemic focus","change of R0","confirmed cases","disease control of Coronavirus Disease","Different patterns of disease spread","Baidu Migration","consistent decline of R0","proportion of imported cases","impact of different patterns of migration flow","significant association","novel infectious disease","initial stage of response","basic reproduction number R0","epidemiological information of confirmed COVID","Level","years","weak association","average age","female","controlling policy","Significant difference","differentiated controlling policies","Major Public Health Emergencies","Prevention","municipal Centers","Spearman correlation analysis","insight","rate","consideration","period","Methods","Objective","order","Conclusion","CDC","situation","Background","total"],"language":"en"},

In the absence of wide-spread testing, we provide one approach to infer prevalence based on the assumption that the fraction of true infections needing hospitalization is fixed and that all hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara are identified. Our goal is to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. the true number of people currently infected with the virus, divided by the total population size. Our analysis suggests that as of March 17, 2020, there are 6,500 infections (0.34% of the population) of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Based on adjusting the parameters of our model to be optimistic (respectively pessimistic), the number of infections would be 1,400 (resp. 26,000), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.08% (resp. 1.36%). If the shelter-in-place led to R0 \u003C 1, we would expect the number of infections to remain about constant for the next few weeks.

Few studies have compared these clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 to other acute respiratory illnesses. Methods: We examined all patients presenting to an emergency department in San Francisco, California between February 3 and March 31, 2020 with an acute respiratory illness who were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We determined COVID-19 status by PCR and metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). We compared demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory results including viral diagnostics using PCR and mNGS. Among those hospitalized, we determined differences in treatment (antibiotics, antivirals, respiratory support) and outcomes (ICU admission, ICU interventions, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury). Findings: In a cohort of 316 patients, 33 (10%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 31 patients, all without COVID-19, tested positive for another respiratory virus (16%). Among patients with additional viral testing, no co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 were identified by PCR or mNGS. Patients with COVID-19 reported longer symptoms duration (median 7 vs. 3 days), and were more likely to report fever (82% vs. 44%), fatigue (85% vs. 50%), and myalgias (61% vs 27%); p\u003C0.001 for all comparisons. Lymphopenia (55% vs 34%, p=0.018) and bilateral opacities on initial chest radiograph (55% vs. 24%, p=0.001) were more common in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were more often hospitalized (79% vs. 56%, p=0.014). Of 186 hospitalized patients, patients with COVID-19 had longer hospitalizations (median 10.7d vs. 4.7d, p\u003C0.001) and were more likely to develop ARDS (23% vs. 3%, p\u003C0.001). Most comorbidities, home medications, signs and symptoms, vital signs, laboratory results, treatment, and outcomes did not differ by COVID-19 status. Interpretation: While we found differences in clinical features of COVID-19 compared to other acute respiratory illnesses, there was significant overlap in presentation and comorbidities. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to the hospital, have longer hospitalizations and develop ARDS, and were unlikely to have co-existent viral infections. These findings enhance understanding of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison to other acute respiratory illnesses.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah, S.

We use equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation to study the dynamics of the complex. We perform end-state binding energy calculations to gain a residue-level insight into the binding process and use the information to incorporate point mutations into the peptide. We demonstrate using binding energy calculations that the peptide with certain point mutations, especially E17L, shows a stronger binding to the RBD as compared to the wild type peptide.

COVID-19-associated deaths are mainly attributed to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. Recent work demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lung. To better understand ACE2 abundance and expression patterns in the lung we interrogated our in-house single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset containing 70,085 EPCAM\u002B lung epithelial cells from paired normal and lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a diverse repertoire of airway lineages that included alveolar type I and II, bronchioalveolar, club/secretory, quiescent and proliferating basal, ciliated and malignant cells as well as rare populations such as ionocytes. While the fraction of lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 was low (1.7% overall), alveolar type II (AT2, 2.2% ACE2\u002B) cells exhibited highest levels of ACE2 expression among all cell subsets. Further analysis of the AT2 compartment (n = 27,235 cells) revealed a number of genes co-expressed with ACE2 that are important for lung pathobiology including those associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; HHIP), pneumonia and infection (FGG and C4BPA) as well as malarial/bacterial (CD36) and viral (DMBT1) scavenging which, for the most part, were increased in smoker versus light or non-smoker cells. Notably, DMBT1 was highly expressed in AT2 cells relative to other lung epithelial subsets and its expression positively correlated with ACE2. We describe a population of ACE2-positive AT2 cells that co-express pathogen (including viral) receptors (e.g. DMBT1) with crucial roles in host defense thus comprising plausible phenotypic targets for treatment of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Guangchun; Sinjab, Ansam; Treekitkarnmongkol, Warapen; Brennan, Patrick; Hara, Kieko; Chang, Kyle; Bogatenkova, Elena; Sanchez-Espiridion, Beatriz; Behrens, Carmen; Gao, Boning; Girard, Luc; Zhang, Jianjun; Sepesi, Boris; Cascone, Tina; Byers, Lauren; Gibbons, Don L.; Chen, Jichao; Moghaddam, Seyed Javad; Ostrin, Edwin J.; Fujimoto, Junya; Shay, Jerry; Heymach, John V.; Minna, John D.; Dubinett, Steven; Scheet, Paul A.; Wistuba, Ignacio I.; Hill, Edward; Telesco, Shannon; Stevenson, Christopher; Spira, Avrum E.; Wang, Linghua; Kadara, Humam","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f0276f8af41b2f0e69f864edb06a4c1d2a5b146.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.045617","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fraction of lung epithelial cells","malignant cells","non-smoker cells","ACE2 abundance","population of ACE2","positive AT2 cells","AT2 cells relative","lung epithelial subsets","lung pathobiology","highest levels of ACE2 expression","lung adenocarcinoma tissues","DMBT1","AT2 compartment","expression patterns","cell subsets","treatment of COVID","alveolar type","ongoing pandemic COVID","severe pneumonia","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","Transcriptomic analysis","associated deaths","co-express pathogen","number of genes co-","in-house single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset","EPCAM","host defense","plausible phenotypic targets","HHIP","COPD","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","diverse repertoire of airway lineages","crucial roles","bronchioalveolar","receptors","C4BPA","infection","causative agent","binds","CD36","rare populations","angiotensin","club","FGG","respiratory failure","Recent work","enzyme","ionocytes"],"language":"en"},

Case 1: A 46-year-old-man with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 infection was being administered favipiravir. Fentanyl, propofol, and rocuronium were also given. On day 3, midazolam administration was initiated for deep sedation. On day 5, his high body temperature increased to 41.2 \u00B0C, creatine kinase level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS was suspected, and supportive therapy was initiated. High-grade fever persisted for 4 days and subsided on day 9. Case 2: A 44-year-old-man with ARDS caused by COVID-19 infection was being treated with favipiravir. On day 5, risperidone was started for delirium. On day 7, his body temperature suddenly increased to 40.8 \u00B0C, his CK level elevated, and he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, altered consciousness, and diaphoresis. NMS diagnosis was confirmed, and both, favipiravir and risperidone were discontinued on day 8. On the same day, his CK levels decreased, and his body temperature normalized on day 9. Patients with COVID-19 infection frequently require deep sedation and develop delirium; therefore, more attention should be paid to the development of NMS in patients who are being administered such causative agents. The mechanism underlying the occurrence of NMS in COVID-19 patients treated with favipiravir remains unknown. Therefore, careful consideration of NMS development is necessary in the management of COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"So, Mitsuhito; Hifumi, Toru; Isokawa, Shutaro; Shimizu, Masato; Otani, Norio; Ishimatsu, Shinichi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9527ae87a515c82ad344f5c315d77a9c1d629458.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720303843; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720303843?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NMS","ARDS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["favipiravir","development of NMS","management of COVID","occurrence of NMS","NMS diagnosis","Patients","infection","careful consideration of NMS development","high body temperature","tachycardia","ARDS","year-old","CK level elevated","tachypnea","altered consciousness","deep sedation","diaphoresis","attention","delirium","risperidone","creatine kinase level elevated","CK levels","neuroleptic malignant syndrome","acute respiratory distress syndrome","midazolam administration","cases of Coronavirus Disease","days","Fentanyl","propofol","rocuronium","High-grade fever","intensive care","supportive therapy","mechanism","causative agents"],"language":"en"},

However, little has been done to account for the potential confounding effects of these factors. Using a large multivariate analysis, this study illuminates modulators of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in U.S. counties while controlling for risk factors across multiple domains. Methods: Data on COVID-19 and various risk factors in all U.S. counties was collected from publicly available data sources through April 14, 2020. Counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases were included in case analyses and those with at least 10 deaths were included in mortality models. The 661 counties meeting inclusion criteria for number of cases were grouped into quartiles and comparisons of risk factors were made using t-tests between the highest and lowest quartiles. Similar comparisons for 217 counties were made for above average and below average deaths/100,000. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of factors that significantly impacted cases and deaths. Results: Univariate analyses demonstrated numerous significant differences between cohorts for both cases and deaths. Risk factors associated with increased cases and/or deaths per 100,000 included increased GDP per capita, decreased social distancing, increased age, increased percent Black, decreased percent Hispanic, decreased percent Asian, decreased health, increased poverty, increased diabetes, increased coronary heart disease, increased physical inactivity, increased alcohol consumption, increased tobacco use, and decreased access to primary care. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcome independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other mitigating factors. Lower daily temperatures was also an independent risk factor in case load but not deaths. Conclusions: U.S. counties with a higher proportion of Black residents are associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. However, the various suggested mechanisms, such as socioeconomic and healthcare predispositions, did not appear to drive the effect of race in our model. Counties with higher average daily temperatures are also associated with decreased COVID-19 cases but not deaths. Several theories are posited to explain these findings, including prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Additional studies are needed to further understand these effects.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Adam Y; Hannah, Theodore C; Durbin, John; Dreher, Nickolas; McAuley, Fiona M; Marayati, Naoum Fares; Spiera, Zachary; Ali, Muhammad; Gometz, Alex; Kostman, JT; Choudhri, Tanvir F","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/575314e1eaae3a145537f63a9e12d07a34782ae8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20069708v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs0Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["increased COVID","increased cases","increased poverty","decreased COVID","increased diabetes","increased age","increased GDP","increased percent Black","various risk factors","comparisons of risk factors","average deaths","decreased health","independent effects of factors","mitigating factors","increased tobacco use","increased alcohol consumption","decreased access","independent risk factor","worse COVID","number of cases","impacted cases","case analyses","decreased percent Asian","decreased percent Hispanic","health care","social determinants of health","Multivariate regression analyses","social distancing","Black race","study illuminates modulators of COVID","Univariate analyses","counties meeting inclusion criteria","logistic regression analyses","higher average daily temperatures","underlying health conditions","case load","higher proportion of Black residents","outcome independent of comorbidities","Lower daily temperatures","potential confounding effects","Coronavirus disease","primary care","lowest quartiles","effect of race","Similar comparisons","mortality models","coronary heart disease","large multivariate analysis","various suggested mechanisms","available data sources","physical inactivity","environmental variables","numerous significant differences","cohorts","patient demographics","adherence","incidence","t-tests","findings","Results","prevalence of vitamin D deficiency","multiple domains","healthcare predispositions","Objectives","death rates","Methods","Conclusions","world","Additional studies","theories"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, we implemented immunoinformatics approach to design an efficient multi-epitopes vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Results The designed vaccine construct has several immunodominant epitopes from structural proteins of Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope. These peptides promote cellular and humoral immunity and Interferon gamma responses. In addition, these epitopes have antigenicity ability and no allergenicity probability. To enhance the vaccine immunogenicity, we used three potent adjuvants; Flagellin, a driven peptide from high mobility group box 1 as HP-91 and human beta defensin 3 protein. The physicochemical and immunological properties of the vaccine structure were evaluated. Tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and refined by I-Tasser and galaxi refine and validated using Rampage and ERRAT. Results of Ellipro showed 242 residues from vaccine might be conformational B cell epitopes. Docking of vaccine with Toll-Like Receptors 3, 5 and 8 proved an appropriate interaction between the vaccine and receptor proteins. In silico cloning demonstrated that the vaccine can be efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli. Conclusions The designed multi epitope vaccine is potentially antigenic in nature and has the ability to induce humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.

The direct RT-qPCR approach correctly identified 92% of NP samples (n = 155) demonstrated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by traditional clinical diagnostic RT-qPCR that included an RNA extraction. Thus, direct RT-qPCR could be a front-line approach to identify the substantial majority of COVID-19 patients, reserving a repeat test with RNA extraction for those individuals with high suspicion of infection but an initial negative result. This strategy would drastically ease supply chokepoints of COVID-19 testing and should be applicable throughout the world.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bruce, Emily A.; Huang, Meei-Li; Perchetti, Garrett A.; Tighe, Scott; Laaguiby, Pheobe; Hoffman, Jessica J.; Gerrard, Diana L.; Nalla, Arun K.; Wei, Yulun; Greninger, Alexander L.; Diehl, Sean A.; Shirley, David J.; Leonard, Debra G.

METHODS: Between October 2013 and December 2014, 276 patients with esophageal cancer in our department were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized into two groups: FTS pathway group and conventional pathway group. The postoperative hospital stay, hospitalization expenditure, and postoperative complications were recorded. The markers of inflammatory and immune function were measured before operation as well as on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th postoperative days (POD), including serum level of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum globulin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA) and lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3 lymphocytes, CD4 lymphocytes, CD8 lymphocytes and the CD4/CD8 ratio) in the patients between the two groups. RESULTS: In all, 260 patients completed the study: 128 in the FTS group and 132 in the conventional group. We found implementation of FTS pathway decreases postoperative length of stay and hospital charges (P \u003C 0.05). In addition, inflammatory reactions, based on IL-6 and CRP levels, were less intense following FTS pathway compared to conventional pathway on POD1 and POD3 (P \u003C 0.05). On POD1 and POD3, the levels of IgG, IgA, CD3 lymphocytes, CD4 lymphocytes and the CD4/CD8 ratio in FTS group were significantly higher than those in control group (All P \u003C 0.05). However, there were no differences in the level of IgM and CD8 lymphocytes between the two groups.

An important challenge in infectious disease research is to understand molecular similarities and differences in mammalian host response to diverse sets of pathogens. Recently, systems biology studies have produced rich collections of omic profiles measuring host response to infectious agents such as influenza viruses at multiple levels. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory network driving host response to multiple infectious agents, we integrated host transcriptomes and proteomes using a network-based approach. Our approach combines expression-based regulatory network inference, structured-sparsity based regression, and network information flow to infer putative physical regulatory programs for expression modules. We applied our approach to identify regulatory networks, modules and subnetworks that drive host response to multiple influenza infections. The inferred regulatory network and modules are significantly enriched for known pathways of immune response and implicate apoptosis, splicing, and interferon signaling processes in the differential response of viral infections of different pathogenicities. We used the learned network to prioritize regulators and study virus and time-point specific networks. RNAi-based knockdown of predicted regulators had significant impact on viral replication and include several previously unknown regulators. Taken together, our integrated analysis identified novel module level patterns that capture strain and pathogenicity-specific patterns of expression and helped identify important regulators of host response to influenza infection.","publish_time":"2016-07-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chasman, Deborah; Walters, Kevin B.; Lopes, Tiago J.

Csk partially colocalized with viral replication compartments. Dengue infection was drastically reduced in cells lacking the three ubiquitous src family kinases, Src, Fyn and Yes. Csk knock-down in these cells failed to block dengue virus replication suggesting that the effect of Csk is via regulation of Src family kinases. Csk was found to be hyper-phosphorylated during dengue infection and inhibition of protein kinase A led to a block in Csk phosphorylation and dengue virus replication.

Alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) play an important role in orchestrating the pulmonary antiviral host response. After IV infection they release a cascade of immune mediators, one of which is granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF is known to promote differentiation, activation and mobilization of myeloid cells. In the lung, GM-CSF drives immune functions of alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) and also improves epithelial repair processes through direct interaction with AECs.

In addition, IAV have been implicated in occasional pandemics with inordinate health and economic consequences.

To circumvent this requirement, replication-competent IAV expressing an easily traceable reporter protein can be used. Here we discuss the development and applications of recombinant replication-competent IAV harboring diverse fluorescent or bioluminescent reporter genes in different locations of the viral genome. These viruses have been employed for in vitro and in vivo studies, such as the screening of neutralizing antibodies or antiviral compounds, the identification of host factors involved in viral replication, cell tropism, the development of vaccines, or the assessment of viral infection dynamics. In summary, reporter-expressing, replicating-competent IAV represent a powerful tool for the study of IAV both in vitro and in vivo.","publish_time":"2016-06-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Breen, Michael; Nogales, Aitor; Baker, Steven F.; Mart\u00EDnez-Sobrido, Luis","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/649b2f2aba88c512775160f197a250e51ac8bc14.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4974514.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4974514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["study of IAV","viral replication","applications of recombinant replication-competent IAV","viral genome","viruses","bioluminescent reporter genes","traceable reporter protein","development of vaccines","assessment of viral infection dynamics","diverse fluorescent","cause annual seasonal human respiratory disease epidemics","antiviral compounds","different locations","identification of host factors","occasional pandemics","cell tropism","inordinate health","powerful tool","screening of neutralizing antibodies","use of laborious secondary methodologies","economic consequences","virus-infected cells","Influenza","requirement","studies","summary","addition"],"language":"en"},

The extensive expression of CFTR in the enteric ganglia suggests that CFTR may play a role in the physiology of the innervation of the gastro-intestinal tract. The presence of dysfunctional CFTRs in enteric ganglia could, to a certain extent, explain the gastrointestinal symptoms frequently experienced by CF patients.","publish_time":"2016-08-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xue, Ruiqi; Gu, Huan; Qiu, Yamei; Guo, Yong; Korteweg, Christine; Huang, Jin; Gu, Jiang","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9a13ccd6be3536af404c25e748c34eac997c5d16.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4974654.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4974654/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFTR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CFTR expression","Expression of CFTR protein","extensive expression of CFTR","enteric ganglia","distribution of CFTR","human gastrointestinal tract","sympathetic ganglia","gastrointestinal symptoms","gastro-intestinal tract","CF patients","formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal gastrointestinal tract samples","surgical patients","cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator","anion selective transmembrane ion channel","microdissection","nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction","cecum","ileum","laser","appendix","jejunum","gene","innervation","stomach","segments","chloride transport","spinal cord","certain extent","colon","situ hybridization","duodenum","Fresh tissue","neurons","presence of dysfunctional CFTRs","mRNA","brain","physiology","Immunohistochemistry","rectum","autopsy cases","mutations","role","epithelia of various organs","study"],"language":"en"},

Here, we show that the absence of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in genetic knock-out mice strongly abrogates pyroptosis in AMs and alleviates the LPS-induced lung injury and systemic inflammation. Our study demonstrates that IRF-1 contributes to caspase-1 activation and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain pyroptosome formation in AMs and leads to downstream inflammatory cytokine release, including that of IL-1\u03B2, IL-18, and HMGB1. The nuclear translocation of IRF-1 is linked to the presence of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Our findings suggest that pyroptosis and the downstream inflammatory response in AMs induced by LPS is a process that is dependent on TLR4-mediated up-regulation of IRF-1.

Despite these recommendations, limited empirical information exists on the frequency and characteristics of mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks occurring in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review to identify articles about mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks occurring in the United States from 2005 to 2014. A standard form was used to abstract information from relevant articles identified from six medical, behavioral and social science literature databases. We also analyzed data from the National Outbreaks Reporting System (NORS), maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2009, to estimate the frequency of mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks reported to the system. RESULTS: We identified 21 published articles describing 72 mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks. Of these 72, 40 (56%) were associated with agriculture fairs and Influenza A H3N2v following probable swine exposure, and 25 (35%) with youth summer camps and pandemic Influenza A H1N1. Outbreaks of measles (n = 1) and mumps (n = 2) were linked to the international importation of disease. Between 2009 and 2013, 1,114 outbreaks were reported to NORS, including 96 respiratory disease outbreaks due to Legionella. None of these legionellosis outbreaks was linked to a mass gathering according to available data. CONCLUSION: Mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks may be uncommon in the United States, but have been reported from fairs (zoonotic transmission) as well as at camps where participants have close social contact in communal housing. International importation can also be a contributing factor. NORS collects information on certain respiratory diseases and could serve as a platform to monitor mass gathering-related respiratory outbreaks in the future.","publish_time":"2016-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rainey, Jeanette J.; Phelps, Tiffani; Shi, Jianrong","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b8797e77d9c91dd2cab19ba2e67cf32b6dd97bf6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/81d66de97e0d60ca4e91efa3aa95f684b914a865.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4990208.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4990208/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Outbreaks Reporting System","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","NORS"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["related respiratory disease outbreaks","related respiratory outbreaks","National Outbreaks","Outbreaks of measles","legionellosis outbreaks","mass gatherings","frequency of mass","Disease Control","characteristics of mass","international importation of disease","infectious disease transmission","certain respiratory diseases","NORS","United States","pandemic Influenza","relevant articles","published articles","empirical information","social science literature databases","large gatherings","severe pandemic","zoonotic transmission","agriculture fairs","available data","close social contact","youth summer camps","systematic literature review","environments conducive","H3N2v","public health officials","participants","communal housing","probable swine exposure","H1N1","Centers","Prevention","BACKGROUND","platform","CONCLUSION","future","Legionella","contributing factor","METHODS","standard form","recommendations","RESULTS","mumps"],"language":"en"},

Such research, when conducted by responsible scientists, usually aims to improve understanding of disease causing agents, their interaction with human hosts, and/or their potential to cause pandemics. The ultimate objective of such research is to better inform public health and preparedness efforts and/or development of medical countermeasures. Despite these important potential benefits, GOF research (GOFR) can pose risks regarding biosecurity and biosafety. In 2014 the administration of US President Barack Obama called for a \u201Cpause\u201D on funding (and relevant research with existing US Government funding) of GOF experiments involving influenza, SARS, and MERS viruses in particular. With announcement of this pause, the US Government launched a \u201Cdeliberative process\u201D regarding risks and benefits of GOFR to inform future funding decisions\u2014and the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) was tasked with making recommendations to the US Government on this matter. As part of this deliberative process the National Institutes of Health commissioned this Ethical Analysis White Paper, requesting that it provide (1) review and summary of ethical literature on GOFR, (2) identification and analysis of existing ethical and decision-making frameworks relevant to (i) the evaluation of risks and benefits of GOFR, (ii) decision-making about the conduct of GOF studies, and (iii) the development of US policy regarding GOFR (especially with respect to funding of GOFR), and (3) development of an ethical and decision-making framework that may be considered by NSABB when analyzing information provided by GOFR risk-benefit assessment, and when crafting its final recommendations (especially regarding policy decisions about funding of GOFR in particular). The ethical and decision-making framework ultimately developed is based on the idea that there are numerous ethically relevant dimensions upon which any given case of GOFR can fare better or worse (as opposed to there being necessary conditions that are either satisfied or not satisfied, where all must be satisfied in order for a given case of GOFR to be considered ethically acceptable): research imperative, proportionality, minimization of risks, manageability of risks, justice, good governance (i.e., democracy), evidence, and international outlook and engagement. Rather than drawing a sharp bright line between GOFR studies that are ethically acceptable and those that are ethically unacceptable, this framework is designed to indicate where any given study would fall on an ethical spectrum\u2014where imaginable cases of GOFR might range from those that are most ethically acceptable (perhaps even ethically praiseworthy or ethically obligatory), at one end of the spectrum, to those that are most ethically problematic or unacceptable (and thus should not be funded, or conducted), at the other. The aim should be that any GOFR pursued (and/or funded) should be as far as possible towards the former end of the spectrum.","publish_time":"2016-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Selgelid, Michael J.","journal":"Sci Eng Ethics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f19ee7acbb2ad1c239249b6daea63a46d6178279.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4996883.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4996883/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozcw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Barack Obama"],"organizations":["US Government","GOFR","National Institutes of Health","Ethical Analysis White Paper"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["funding of GOFR","benefits of GOFR","GOFR studies","given case of GOFR","GOF research","imaginable cases of GOFR","relevant research","ethical spectrum","existing US Government funding","GOFR risk-benefit assessment","development of US policy","research imperative","analysis of existing ethical","manageability of risks","minimization of risks","evaluation of risks","future funding decisions","decision-making frameworks relevant","summary of ethical literature","GOF experiments","Ethical Analysis White Paper","conduct of GOF studies","US National Science Advisory Board","policy decisions","relevant dimensions","administration of US President Barack Obama","biosecurity","deliberative process","important potential benefits","NSABB","given study","pause","National Institutes of Health","development of medical countermeasures","public health","final recommendations","SARS","influenza","proportionality","agents","justice","good governance","preparedness efforts","evidence","interaction","democracy","MERS viruses","information","sharp bright line","function","identification","respect","international outlook","human hosts","engagement","understanding of disease","review","experimentation","order","responsible scientists","transmissibility","virulence of pathogens","idea","Gain","ultimate objective","biosafety","announcement","matter","necessary conditions","pandemics","aim"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We monitored the plasma levels of type III IFNs in relation to the phenotype and the function of NK cells in a cohort of people who inject drugs (PWID) during acute HCV infection with different outcomes.

The Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse reference population is a promising model for pharmacogenomic studies because of its large amount of genetic variation, genetic reproducibility, and dense recombination sites. While the CC lines are phenotypically diverse, their genetic diversity in drug disposition processes, such as detoxification reactions, is still largely uncharacterized. Here we systematically measured RNA-sequencing expression profiles from livers of 29 CC lines under baseline conditions. We then leveraged a reference collection of metabolic biotransformation pathways to map potential relations between drugs and their underlying expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). By applying this approach on proximal eQTLs, including eQTLs acting on the overall expression of genes and on the expression of particular transcript isoforms, we were able to construct the organization of hepatic eQTL-drug connectivity across the CC population. The analysis revealed a substantial impact of genetic variation acting on drug biotransformation, allowed mapping of potential joint genetic effects in the context of individual drugs, and demonstrated crosstalk between drug metabolism and lipid metabolism.

Agreement with taxonomy should be taken as a major criterion to estimate prokaryotic phylogenetic trees.","publish_time":"2011-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zuo, Guanghong; Xu, Zhao; Yu, Hongjie; Hao, Bailin","journal":"Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ce53771489f0701f2753a2bb49c861c5f73bc461.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5054193.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5054193/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE2NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["alignment-free approach","parameter-free method","agreement","prokaryotic phylogenetic trees","time-consuming statistical re-sampling tests","Composition vector trees","corresponding taxonomy","inferred phylogeny","self-consistency of CVTrees","viewpoint","bootstrap","objective justification","major criterion","stability","genome data","ultimate goal","work"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The expression of autophagy-related genes in HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma and non-HBV-HCC cell lines and human liver tissues was examined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. The silencing of target genes was used to examine the function of various genes in apoptosis and cell cycle progression. RESULTS: The expression of autophagy related genes ATG5, ATG12, ATG9A and ATG4B expression was analyzed in HepG2.2.15 cells and compared with HepG2 and THLE cells. We found that ATG5 and ATG12 mRNA expression was significantly increased in HepG2.2.15 cells compared to HepG2 cells (P \u003C 0.005). Moreover, ATG5-ATG12 protein levels were increased in tumor liver tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues mainly from HCC patients with HBV infection. We also analyzed the function of ATG12 in cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased by 11.4% in ATG12-silenced HepG2.2.15 cells (P \u003C 0.005) but did not change in ATG12-silenced HepG2 cells under starvation with Earle\u2019s balanced salt solution.

Tracing the evolutionary ancestry of HEV has proved difficult since its identification in 1992, it has been reclassified several times, and confusion remains surrounding its origins and ancestry. RESULTS: To reveal close protein relatives of the Hepeviridae family, similarity searching of the GenBank database was carried out using a complete Orthohepevirus A, HEV genotype I (GI) ORF1 protein sequence and individual proteins. The closest non-Hepeviridae homologues to the HEV ORF1 encoded polyprotein were found to be those from the lepidopteran-infecting Alphatetraviridae family members. A consistent relationship to this was found using a phylogenetic approach; the Hepeviridae RdRp clustered with those of the Alphatetraviridae and Benyviridae families. This puts the Hepeviridae ORF1 region within the \u201CAlpha-like\u201D super-group of viruses. In marked contrast, the HEV GI capsid was found to be most closely related to the chicken astrovirus capsid, with phylogenetic trees clustering the Hepeviridae capsid together with those from the Astroviridae family, and surprisingly within the \u201CPicorna-like\u201D supergroup. These results indicate an ancient recombination event has occurred at the junction of the non-structural and structure encoding regions, which led to the emergence of the entire Hepeviridae family. The Astroviridae capsid is also closely related to the Tymoviridae family of monopartite, T = 3 icosahedral plant viruses, whilst its non-structural region is related to viruses of the Potyviridae; a large family of plant-infecting viruses with a flexible filamentous rod-shaped virion. Thus, we identified a separate inter-viral family recombination event, again at the non-structural/structural junction, which likely led to the creation of the Astroviridae. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we have shown that new viral families have been created though recombination at the junction of the genome that encodes non-structural and structural proteins, and such recombination events are implicated in the genesis of important human pathogens; HEV, astrovirus and rubella virus.

However, its general application has been hampered by difficulty in identifying a specific ligand-responsive pseudoknot that also functions as a ligand-dependent -1 PRF stimulator. We addressed this problem by using the \u22121 PRF stimulation pseudoknot of SARS-CoV (SARS-PK) to build a ligand-dependent \u22121 PRF stimulator. In particular, the extra stem of SARS-PK was replaced by an RNA aptamer of theophylline and designed to couple theophylline binding with the stimulation of \u22121 PRF.

Moreover, many of these viruses are select agents (SAs), and their genomes are also considered SAs. For this reason, cDNAs and/or their derivatives must be tested to ensure the absence of infectious virus and/or viral RNA before transfer out of the BSL-3/4 and/or SA laboratory. This tremendously limits the capacity to conduct viral genomic research, particularly the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Here, we present a sequence-independent method to rapidly amplify viral genomic RNA while simultaneously abolishing both viral and genomic RNA infectivity across multiple single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ssRNA\u002B) virus families. The process generates barcoded DNA amplicons that range in length from 300 to 1,000 bp, which cannot be used to rescue a virus and are stable to transport at room temperature. Our barcoding approach allows for up to 288 barcoded samples to be pooled into a single library and run across various NGS platforms without potential reconstitution of the viral genome. Our data demonstrate that this approach provides full-length genomic sequence information not only from high-titer virion preparations but it can also recover specific viral sequence from samples with limited starting material in the background of cellular RNA, and it can be used to identify pathogens from unknown samples. In summary, we describe a rapid, universal standard operating procedure that generates high-quality NGS libraries free of infectious virus and infectious viral RNA. IMPORTANCE This report establishes and validates a standard operating procedure (SOP) for select agents (SAs) and other biosafety level 3 and/or 4 (BSL-3/4) RNA viruses to rapidly generate noninfectious, barcoded cDNA amenable for next-generation sequencing (NGS). This eliminates the burden of testing all processed samples derived from high-consequence pathogens prior to transfer from high-containment laboratories to lower-containment facilities for sequencing. Our established protocol can be scaled up for high-throughput sequencing of hundreds of samples simultaneously, which can dramatically reduce the cost and effort required for NGS library construction. NGS data from this SOP can provide complete genome coverage from viral stocks and can also detect virus-specific reads from limited starting material. Our data suggest that the procedure can be implemented and easily validated by institutional biosafety committees across research laboratories.","publish_time":"2016-06-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moser, Lindsey A.; Ramirez-Carvajal, Lisbeth; Puri, Vinita; Pauszek, Steven J.; Matthews, Krystal; Dilley, Kari A.; Mullan, Clancy; McGraw, Jennifer; Khayat, Michael; Beeri, Karen; Yee, Anthony; Dugan, Vivien; Heise, Mark T.; Frieman, Matthew B.; Rodriguez, Luis L.; Bernard, Kristen A.; Wentworth, David E.; Stockwell, Timothy B.; Shabman, Reed S.","journal":"mSystems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ad724f7660b9d84da71a1855f411b5a450aa309e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5069770.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5069770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzE5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS","SOP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infectious viral RNA","viral genomic RNA","viral genome","viral genomic research","viral stocks","NGS data","specific viral sequence","genomic RNA infectivity","single-stranded RNA viruses","barcoded samples","high-consequence pathogens","positive-sense RNA","absence of infectious virus","background of cellular RNA","high-quality NGS libraries free of infectious virus","high-containment laboratories","virus families","NGS library construction","processed samples","generation sequencing","unknown samples","SAs","BSL","high-throughput sequencing of hundreds","virus-specific reads","various NGS platforms","single library","biosafety level","full-length genomic sequence information","limited starting material","SOP","universal standard operating procedure","high-titer virion preparations","research laboratories","genomes","agents","transfer","sequence-independent method","barcoded cDNA amenable","barcoded DNA amplicons","institutional biosafety committees","containment facilities","barcoding approach","complete genome coverage","potential reconstitution","ssRNA","application","effort","report","permissive cells","cost","capacity","cDNAs","room temperature","burden","SA laboratory","established protocol","reason","derivatives","IMPORTANCE","bp","summary"],"language":"en"},

Methods: In 2015, using snowball sampling, 16 US health care volunteers who had recently returned from West Africa were recruited for this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect information associated with each phase of deployment (pre, peri, and post). Results: Participants reported that they were motivated to volunteer because of a sense of responsibility and feelings of empathy and altruism. Immediately prior to deployment, most reported fear of contagion and death, as well as doubts regarding the adequacy of their training. Family members and close friends expressed high levels of concern regarding participants\u2019 decisions to volunteer. During the deployment, participants were fearful of exposure and reported feeling emotionally and physically exhausted. They also reported feeling frustrated by extreme resource limitations, poor management of the mission, lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and inability to provide high quality care. Upon return home, participants felt a sense of isolation, depression, stigmatization, interpersonal difficulties, and extreme stress. Conclusion: Preparedness of volunteers was suboptimal at each stage of deployment. All stakeholders, including volunteers, sponsoring organizations, government agencies, and professional organizations have a shared responsibility in ensuring that volunteers to medical missions are adequately prepared.

We have previously shown that local type I interferon response within the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in the protection of mice against tick-borne flavivirus infection. However, the cells responsible for mounting this protective response are not defined. METHODS: Primary astrocytes were isolated from wild-type (WT) and interferon alpha receptor knock out (IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212)) mice and infected with neurotropic flaviviruses. Viral replication and spread, IFN induction and response, and cellular viability were analyzed. Transcriptional levels in primary astrocytes treated with interferon or supernatant from virus-infected cells were analyzed by RNA sequencing and evaluated by different bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Here, we show that astrocytes control viral replication of different TBEV strains, JEV, WNV, and ZIKV. In contrast to fibroblast, astrocytes mount a rapid interferon response and restrict viral spread. Furthermore, basal expression levels of key interferon-stimulated genes are high in astrocytes compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Bioinformatic analysis of RNA-sequencing data reveals that astrocytes have established a basal antiviral state which contributes to the rapid viral recognition and upregulation of interferons. The most highly upregulated pathways in neighboring cells were linked to type I interferon response and innate immunity. The restriction in viral growth was dependent on interferon signaling, since loss of the interferon receptor, or its blockade in wild-type cells, resulted in high viral replication and virus-induced cytopathic effects. Astrocyte supernatant from TBEV-infected cells can restrict TBEV growth in astrocytes already 6 h post infection, the effect on neurons is highly reinforced, and astrocyte supernatant from 3 h post infection is already protective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the combination of an intrinsic constitutive antiviral response and the fast induction of type I IFN production by astrocytes play an important role in self-protection of astrocytes and suppression of flavivirus replication in the CNS.

Chronic intermittent hypoxia is used to model the arterial hypoxemia seen in SA, and through this paradigm, the mechanisms that underlie SA-induced hypertension are becoming clear. Cyclic hypoxic exposure during sleep chronically stimulates the carotid chemoreflexes, inducing sensory long-term facilitation, and drives sympathetic outflow from the hindbrain. The elevated sympathetic tone drives hypertension and renal sympathetic activity to the kidneys resulting in increased plasma renin activity and eventually angiotensin II (Ang II) peripherally. Upon waking, when respiration is normalized, the sympathetic activity does not diminish. This is partially because of adaptations leading to overactivation of the hindbrain regions controlling sympathetic outflow such as the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The sustained sympathetic activity is also due to enhanced synaptic signaling from the forebrain through the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). During the waking hours, when the chemoreceptors are not exposed to hypoxia, the forebrain circumventricular organs (CVOs) are stimulated by peripherally circulating Ang II from the elevated plasma renin activity. The CVOs and median preoptic nucleus chronically activate the PVN due to the Ang II signaling. All together, this leads to elevated nocturnal mean arterial pressure (MAP) as a response to hypoxemia, as well as inappropriately elevated diurnal MAP in response to maladaptations.","publish_time":"2016-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shell, Brent; Faulk, Katelynn; Cunningham, J.

To date, HEV infections can only be treated with ribavirin (RBV). Major drawbacks of this therapy are that RBV is not approved for administration to pregnant women and that the virus can acquire mutations, which render the intra-host population less sensitive or even resistant to RBV. One of the proposed modes of action of RBV is a direct mutagenic effect on viral genomes, inducing mismatches and subsequent nucleotide substitutions. These transition events can drive the already error-prone viral replication beyond an error threshold, causing viral population extinction. In contrast, the expanded heterogeneous viral population can facilitate selection of mutant viruses with enhanced replication fitness. Emergence of these mutant viruses can lead to therapeutic failure. Consequently, the onset of RBV treatment in chronically HEV-infected individuals can result in two divergent outcomes: viral extinction versus selection of fitness-enhanced viruses. Following an overview of RNA viruses treated with RBV in clinics and a summary of the different antiviral modes of action of this drug, we focus on the mutagenic effect of RBV on HEV intrahost populations, and how HEV is able to overcome lethal mutagenesis.","publish_time":"2016-10-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Todt, Daniel; Walter, Stephanie; Brown, Richard J.

We aimed to determine the prevalence and the causes of shock with no diagnosis 24 hours after its onset, and to compare the outcomes of patients with early-confirmed septic shock to those of others. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, prospective, multicenter observational cohort study in ten intensive care units (ICU) in France. We included all consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with suspected septic shock defined by clinical suspicion of infection leading to antibiotic prescription plus acute circulatory failure requiring vasopressor support. RESULTS: A total of 508 patients were admitted with suspected septic shock. Among them, 374 (74 %) had early-confirmed septic shock, while the 134 others (26 %) had no source of infection identified nor microbiological documentation retrieved 24 hours after shock onset. Among these, 37/134 (28 %) had late-confirmed septic shock diagnosed after 24 hours, 59/134 (44 %) had a condition mimicking septic (septic shock mimicker, mainly related to adverse drug reactions, acute mesenteric ischemia and malignancies) and 38/134 (28 %) had shock of unknown origin by the end of the ICU stay. There were no differences between patients with early-confirmed septic shock and the remainder in ICU mortality and the median duration of ICU stay, of tracheal intubation and of vasopressor support. The multivariable Cox model showed that the risk of day-60 mortality did not differ between patients with or without early-confirmed septic shock. A sensitivity analysis was performed in the subgroup (n = 369/508) of patients meeting the Sepsis-3 definition criteria and displayed consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of the patients admitted in the ICU with suspected septic shock had no infection identified 24 hours after its onset and almost half of them were eventually diagnosed with a septic shock mimicker. Outcome did not differ between patients with early-confirmed septic shock and other patients.

The present study aims to investigate the roles of prealbumin (PA) in CAP in children and further determine the usefulness of PA in diagnosis and severity assessment of CAP in children. This was a retrospective analysis of 174 cases of hospitalized children with CAP. The following indicators were recorded: vital sign, inflammatory indexes, PA, and respiratory pathogens immunoglobulin M antibody test results. A total of 33 healthy children were selected as the control group. The results of laboratory tests between CAP and control groups were compared. CAP group was further divided into mild CAP and severe CAP groups, and vital signs and laboratory examination results of 2 groups were compared. The total positive rate of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in this study was 27.4%, and there was no significant difference in different seasons (P = 0.356). Compared with controls, there was no significant difference between procalcitonin and C-reactive protein in CAP group (P = 0.355, 0.061). The white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophils, neutrophil count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the CAP group were significantly higher than those in control group, and PA was significantly lower than that in the control group (all P \u003C 0.05). In the traditional cutoff value (\u003C170 mg/L), the sensitivity of PA for the diagnosis of CAP was 0.847, which was significant higher than traditional inflammatory indicators. Moreover, it was found that PA was an independent protective factor for CAP in children based on multivariate analysis (odds ratio: 0.974; 95% confidence interval: 0.956\u20130.993; P = 0.008). PA level in severe CAP group was significantly lower than in mild CAP group (P = 0.001). With a cutoff value of 125 mg/L, the sensitivity and specificity of PA for the severity assessment of CAP were 0.703 and 0.714, respectively. Combined with traditional inflammatory markers, PA may improve the diagnostic efficacy of CAP in children.

We have examined the preventive effects of carnosine on tissue injury, oedema and inflammation in a murine model for ARDS. Oral administration of carnosine suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular permeability, tissue injury and inflammation in the lung. In vivo imaging analysis revealed that LPS administration increased the level of ROS and that this increase was inhibited by carnosine administration. Carnosine also suppressed LPS-induced neutrophilic inflammation (evaluated by activation of myeloperoxidase in the lung and increased extracellular DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid). Furthermore, carnosine administration suppressed the LPS-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress response in vivo.

A number of international academic groups have developed and parameterized mathematical models of disease spread to forecast the trajectory of the outbreak. These modeling efforts often relied on limited epidemiological data to derive key transmission and severity parameters, which are needed to calibrate mechanistic models. Here, we provide a perspective on some of the challenges and lessons drawn from these efforts, focusing on (1) data availability and accuracy of early forecasts; (2) the ability of different models to capture the profile of early growth dynamics in local outbreaks and the importance of reactive behavior changes and case clustering; (3) challenges in forecasting the long-term epidemic impact very early in the outbreak; and (4) ways to move forward. We conclude that rapid availability of aggregated population-level data and detailed information on a subset of transmission chains is crucial to characterize transmission patterns, while ensemble-forecasting approaches could limit the uncertainty of any individual model. We believe that coordinated forecasting efforts, combined with rapid dissemination of disease predictions and underlying epidemiological data in shared online platforms, will be critical in optimizing the response to current and future infectious disease emergencies.","publish_time":"2017-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chowell, Gerardo; Viboud, C\u00E9cile; Simonsen, Lone; Merler, Stefano; Vespignani, Alessandro","journal":"BMC Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/201371596cb4ae2f74e14bac9e4061d8cc2228a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5331683.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5331683/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa"],"keyphrases":["data availability","modeling efforts","coordinated forecasting efforts","limited epidemiological data","caveats of forecasting approaches","key transmission","transmission patterns","parameterized mathematical models of disease","challenges","mechanistic models","rapid availability of aggregated population-level data","rapid dissemination of disease predictions","subset of transmission chains","accuracy of early forecasts","long-term epidemic impact","ability of different models","future infectious disease emergencies","profile of early growth dynamics","Ebola epidemic","unprecedented impact","local outbreaks","detailed information","importance of reactive behavior changes","case clustering","shared online platforms","unique opportunity","West Africa","response","performances","number of international academic groups","real time","severity parameters","evidence","uncertainty","ensemble","individual model","trajectory","lessons","policy","ways","perspective"],"language":"en"},

Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for influenza virus and other respiratory viruses. We assessed risk factors for clinical severity and conducted clustering analysis to identify viral clusters in children with viral codetection. RESULTS: Hospital-attended influenza virus\u2013positive SARI incidence was 2.0 cases per 10 000 children annually; it was highest among children aged \u003C1 year (6.3 cases per 10 000), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\u2013infected children aged 5\u20139 years (6.0 cases per 10 000). A total of 605 SARI cases (26.8%) had warning signs, which were positively associated with HIV infection (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4\u20133.9), respiratory syncytial virus infection (aRR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3\u20133.0) and rainy season (aRR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6\u20133.8).

A synergistic action of the innate and the adaptive immune system of the host is essential for mounting a durable protective immunity through vaccination. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the transcriptome profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to characterize the innate and the adaptive immune response to PRRS Virus (PRRSV) vaccination in Pietrain pigs. The Affymetrix gene chip porcine gene 1.0 ST array was used for the transcriptome profiling of PBMCs collected at immediately before (D0), at one (D1) and 28 days (D28) post PRRSV vaccination with three biological replications. With FDR \u003C0.05 and log2 fold change \u00B11.5 as cutoff criteria, 295 and 115 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed in PBMCs during the stage of innate and adaptive response, respectively. The microarray expression results were technically validated by qRT-PCR. The gene ontology terms such as viral life cycle, regulation of lymphocyte activation, cytokine activity and inflammatory response were enriched during the innate immunity; cytolysis, T cell mediated cytotoxicity, immunoglobulin production were enriched during adaptive immunity to PRRSV vaccination. Significant enrichment of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, signaling by interleukins, signaling by the B cell receptor (BCR), viral mRNA translation, IFN-gamma pathway and AP-1 transcription factor network pathways were indicating the involvement of altered genes in the antiviral defense. Network analysis revealed that four network modules were functionally involved with the transcriptional network of innate immunity, and five modules were linked to adaptive immunity in PBMCs. The innate immune transcriptional network was found to be regulated by LCK, STAT3, ATP5B, UBB and RSP17. While TGF\u00DF1, IL7R, RAD21, SP1 and GZMB are likely to be predictive for the adaptive immune transcriptional response to PRRSV vaccine in PBMCs.

However, a substantial gap in knowledge still exists regarding differing temporal pattern and potential of transmission of ZIKV in different regions of the world. METHODS: We use a phenomenological model to ascertain the temporal patterns and transmission potential of ZIKV in various countries/territories, by fitting the model to Zika case data from Yap Island and French Polynesia in the Oceania region and 11 countries/territories with confirmed case data, namely, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, and Suriname, to pinpoint the waves of infections in each country/territory and to estimate the respective basic reproduction number R(0). RESULTS: Six of these time series datasets resulted in statistically significant model fit of at least one wave of reported cases, namely that of French Polynesia, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Suriname and Saint Martin. However, only Colombia and Guatemala exhibited two waves of cases while the others had only one wave. Temporal patterns of the second wave in Colombia and the single wave in Suriname are very similar, with the respective turning points separated by merely a week. Moreover, the mean estimates of R(0) for Colombia, Guatemala and Suriname, all land-based populations, range between 1.05 and 1.75, while the corresponding mean estimates for R(0) of island populations in French Polynesia, Puerto Rico and Saint Martin are significantly lower with a range of 5.70\u20136.89. We also fit the Richards model to Zika case data from six main archipelagos in French Polynesia, suggesting the outbreak in all six island populations occurred during the same time, albeit with different peak time, with mean R(0) range of 3.09\u20135.05. DISCUSSION: Using the same modeling methodology, in this study we found a significant difference between transmissibility (as quantified by R(0)) in island populations as opposed to land-based countries/territories, possibly suggesting an important role of geographic heterogeneity in the spread of vector-borne diseases and its future course, which requires further monitoring. Our result has potential implications for planning respective intervention and control policies targeted for island and land-based populations.","publish_time":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Ying-Hen","journal":"PeerJ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcededebc295dbf0fa5130e94002b7fe0a921f51.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5363263.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5363263/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzQ3NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Saint Martin"],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Oceania","Ecuador","Guadeloupe","Mexico","Puerto Rico","Colombia","Guatemala","Suriname"],"keyphrases":["island populations","Colombia","French Polynesia","territories","Guatemala","Suriname","mean R","land-based populations","transmission potential of ZIKV","land-based countries","mean estimates of R","Puerto Rico","French Guiana","Zika case data","potential of transmission","Yap Island","Saint Martin","significant model","range","wave of reported cases","various countries","temporal patterns","phenomenological model","Richards model","single wave","confirmed case data","respective basic reproduction number R","potential implications","respective intervention","different peak time","Zika virus","Oceania region","waves of cases","corresponding mean","differing temporal pattern","time series datasets","respective turning points","World Health Organization","different regions","significant difference","waves of infections","Public Health Emergency of International Concern","Panama","Guillain","microcephaly","Mexico","Guadeloupe","Nicaragua","main archipelagos","control policies","spread of vector","medical complications","knowledge","Ecuador","important role of geographic heterogeneity","diseases","Barr\u00E9 Syndrome","study","territory","outbreak","future course","strong association","modeling methodology","GBS","country","Americas","transmissibility","BACKGROUND","substantial gap","DISCUSSION","monitoring","week","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Increased lethality in men was evident in the first large reports from ChinaCDC and WHO-China, and the gender gap appeared even wider in the early Italian outbreak. Newspapers and scientific journals alike have commented on this finding and the preexisting conditions, biological processes, and gender role behavior differences that may underlie it. However, as for other diseases, and in spite of years of advocating for the collection of raw epidemiological data and the analysis of clinical trial data sets by sex, very little appeared to be released about sex differences in characteristics of the epidemics beyond infection and death rates, such as severity of disease, comorbidities, rate of recovery, length of hospital stay, or number of tests for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. These data are critical not only for scientists to understand the pathophysiology of disease, but also to inform decision-making by countries and healthcare systems on how to prioritize testing and best allocate scarce resources and relief funds. Systematic analysis of official websites for the 20 countries and 6 US states reporting the highest number of cases on March 21, 2020, revealed a wide disparity in sex-disaggregated data made available to the public and scholars. Only a handful of the countries reported cases by sex separately. None of the other characteristics, including fatality rates, were stratified by sex at the time. Beyond suboptimal sex disaggregation, our analysis found a paucity of usable raw data sets and a generalized lack of standardization of captured data, making comparisons difficult. A second round of data capture in April found more complete, but even more disparate, information. Our analysis revealed a wide range of sex ratios among confirmed cases, which changed over time. In countries where a male-biased sex ratio was initially reported, the reported proportion of women among cases dramatically increased in under 3 weeks. In contrast, men were consistently over-represented in severe cases, intensive care admissions, and deaths. We also show that the sex ratio varies with age, with a complex pattern, reproduced across the 6 countries for which data were found. Accurate, peer-reviewed, statistical analysis of harmonized, sex-disaggregated data for other characteristics of epidemics, such as availability of testing, suspected source of infection, or comorbidities will be critical to understand where the observed disparities come from and to generate evidence-based recommendations for decision-making by institutions and governments around the world.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kocher, K.

Abstract A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) highlighted at the end of 2019 in China is spreading across all continents. Most often at the origin of a mild infectious syndrome, associating mild symptoms (fever, cough, myalgia, headache and possible digestive disorders) to different degrees, SARS-Covid-2 can cause serious pulmonary pathologies and sometimes death. Data on the consequences during pregnancy are limited. The first Chinese data published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women are the same as those of the general population. There are no cases of intrauterine maternal-fetal transmission, but cases of newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum or neonatal transmission. Induced prematurity and cases of respiratory distress in newborns of infected mothers have been described. Pregnancy is known as a period at higher risk for the consequences of respiratory infections, as for influenza, so it seems important to screen for Covid-19 in the presence of symptoms and to monitor closely pregnant women. In this context of the SARS-Covid-2 epidemic, the societies of gynecology-obstetrics, infectious diseases and neonatalogy have proposed a French protocol for the management of possible and proven cases of SARS-Covid-2 in pregnant women. These proposals may evolve on a daily basis with the advancement of the epidemic and knowledge in pregnant women. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of cases in pregnant women will be necessary in order to improve knowledge on the subject.","publish_time":"2020-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peyronnet, V.; Sibiude, J.; Deruelle, P.; Huissoud, C.; Lescure, X.; Lucet, J.-C.; Mandelbrot, L.; Nisand, I.; Vayssi\u00E8re, C.; Yazpandanah, Y.; Luton, D.; Picone, O.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e40beae137874d4b123990c812531672004a0c9.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468718920301100; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468718920301100","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Chine","China"],"keyphrases":["the SARS","in the presence","the epidemic","the management","the societies","the subject","Covid","the general population","The first Chinese","an in","knowledge in pregnant women","the same as those","highlighted at the end","the consequences during pregnancy","\u00E9pid\u00E9mie de SARS","published seem to show that the symptoms in pregnant women","Most often at the origin","cases in pregnant women will be necessary in order to improve knowledge","In this context","daily basis with the advancement","respiratory distress in newborns","cas de nouveau","to monitor closely pregnant women","but cases","proven cases","no cases","cas de transmission maternof\u0153tale","femme enceinte","fetal transmission","neonatal transmission","nouveau coronavirus","to different degrees","cas de d\u00E9tresses respiratoires","associating mild symptoms","mild infectious syndrome","respiratory infections","Pregnancy is known as","charge des cas possibles","transmission verticale per","cons\u00E9quences des infections respiratoires","pr\u00E9sence de sympt\u00F4mes","grossesse","risque","continents","so it seems important to screen","origine de pathologies pulmonaires graves","newborns infected early suggest that there could be vertical perpartum","period at higher risk","infected mothers","infectious diseases","diff\u00E9rents degr\u00E9s des sympt\u00F4mes b\u00E9nins","syndrome infectieux","fa\u00E7on rapproch\u00E9e","fa\u00E7on quotidienne","m\u00E8res infect\u00E9es","new coronavirus","population g\u00E9n\u00E9rale","formes graves","possible digestive disorders","is spreading across","femmes enceintes infect\u00E9es","premi\u00E8res donn\u00E9es chinoises publi\u00E9es","can cause serious pulmonary pathologies","depth analysis","influenza","intrauterine maternal","myalgies","fi\u00E8vre","myalgia","headache","fever","cough","proposed","French protocol","c\u00E9phal\u00E9es","neonatalogy","toux","obstetrics","\u00E9ventuels troubles digestifs","gynecology","These proposals may evolve","sometimes death","protocole fran\u00E7ais de prise","gyn\u00E9cologie-obst\u00E9trique","Induced prematurity","n\u00E9onatalogie","avanc\u00E9e","soci\u00E9t\u00E9s savantes","Subsequently","p\u00E9riode","connaissances","limited","pr\u00E9maturit\u00E9 induite","fin","ann\u00E9e","infectiologie","\u00E9vidence","d\u00E9c\u00E8s","described","grippe","Abstract","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","contexte","propositions"],"language":"fr"},

There are variations in how much testing has been done across countries. South Korea, Germany, and Iceland take the bet of massive testing of their population. Whereas tests were not performed widely in southern European countries. As the former undergo a lower case-fatality rate due to the COVID-19 than the latter, the impact of the testing strategy must be investigated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of testing on the case fatality rate. Methods We use data on inpatients across French geographic areas and propose a novel methodology that exploits policy discontinuities at region borders to estimate the effect of COVID-19 tests on the case-fatality rate. In France, testing policies are determined locally. We compare all contiguous department pairs located on the opposite sides of a region border. The heterogeneity in testing rate between department pairs together with the similarities in other dimensions allow us to mimic the existence of treatment and control groups and to identify the impact of testing on mortality. Results The increase of one percentage point in the test rate is associated with a decrease of 0.001 percentage point in the death rate. In other words, for each additional 1000 tests, one person would have remained alive. Conclusion Massive population testing could have a significant effect on mortality in different ways. Mass testing may help decision-makers to implement healthcare measures to limit the spread of the disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Terriau, A.; Albertini, J.; Poirier, A.; LE BASTARD, Q.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f8d59261474f6961ad9b59f0bef8e67b6fc6734.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.26.20080531v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea","Germany","France"],"keyphrases":["testing rate","impact of testing","Mass testing","testing policies","testing strategy","case fatality rate","bet of massive testing","test rate","death rate","Conclusion Massive population testing","lower case-fatality rate","tests","percentage point","effect of COVID","mortality","contiguous department pairs","significant effect","healthcare measures","region border","southern European countries","variety of public health measures","novel methodology","Iceland","French geographic areas","opposite sides","governments","data","inpatients","decision-makers","SARS-CoV2 pandemic","response","Germany","policy discontinuities","control groups","different ways","decrease","heterogeneity","existence of treatment","South Korea","spread","person","similarities","dimensions","Background","Methods","words","increase","France","disease","variations","study"],"language":"en"},

Here we report a 382-nt deletion covering almost the entire open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from eight hospitalized patients in Singapore. The deletion also removes the ORF8 transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the N gene. We also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks. During the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population [1], and similar variation has since been observed across SARS-related CoVs in humans and bats. Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in ORF8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus [2]. This is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human SARS cases possessed an ORF8 deletion that may be associated with host adaptation [1].

Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating T-cells via the HLA complex. SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all overlapping peptides in vitro to deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested 19 epitope-HLA-binding prediction tools, and using an in vitro peptide MHC stability assay, we assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC allotypes. In this investigation of potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allotype in question. Designing a COVID-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is therefore a very challenging task. Here, we present 174 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with high prediction binding scores, validated to bind stably to 11 HLA allotypes.

Data were obtained from 16 young healthy adults (12 women, four men; mean [SD] age 23.0 [2.6] years). Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the resting vastus medialis, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, medial and lateral hamstring, and medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles on the right side of the body using bipolar surface electrodes. TMS was delivered through a 110-mm double-cone coil at 63 sites over the left hemisphere. Location and size of the cortical representation and the number of discrete peaks were quantified for each muscle. Within the quadriceps muscle group there was a main effect of muscle on anterior-posterior centre of gravity (p = 0.010), but the magnitude of the difference was very small. Within the quadriceps there was a main effect of muscle on medial-lateral hotspot (p = 0.027) and map volume (p = 0.047), but no post-hoc tests were significant. The topography of each lower-limb muscle was complex, displaying multiple peaks that were present across the stimulation grid, and variable across individuals. The results of this study indicate that TMS delivered with a 110-mm double-cone coil could not reliably identify discrete cortical representations of resting lower-limb muscles when responses were measured using bipolar surface electromyography.

However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. Study design: Rapid evidence review. Methods: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science for published literature on the reasons for and factors associated with adherence to quarantine during an infectious disease outbreak. Results: We found 3163 papers and included 14 in the review. Adherence to quarantine ranged from as little as 0 up to 92.8%. The main factors which influenced or were associated with adherence decisions were the knowledge people had about the disease and quarantine procedure, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine and perceived risk of the disease, as well as practical issues such as running out of supplies or the financial consequences of being out of work. Conclusions: People vary in their adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks. To improve this, public health officials should provide a timely, clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; emphasise social norms to encourage this altruistic behaviour; increase the perceived benefit that engaging in quarantine will have on public health; and ensure that sufficient supplies of food, medication and other essentials are provided.","publish_time":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Webster, Rebecca; Brooks, Samantha; Smith, Louise; Woodland, Lisa; Wessely, Simon; Rubin, James","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037408","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["quarantine procedure","perceived benefits of quarantine","vexed issue of quarantine","adherence decisions","infectious disease outbreaks","rapid review","social norms","perceived risk","likelihood of people","protocols","knowledge people","Rapid evidence","main factors","public health officials","outbreak of coronavirus","sufficient supplies of food","best available evidence","information","Web of Science","PsycINFO","published literature","clear rationale","reasons","altruistic behaviour","countries","Medline","medication","spotlight","citizens","financial consequences","Study design","practical issues","work","essentials","Methods","papers","Conclusions","contact","infection","Results","Objectives"],"language":"en"},

We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R_0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R_0 will be under-estimated. We also show that as the length of asymptomatic generation intervals increase, estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase of the epidemic decrease. Our analysis provides a rationale for assessing the duration of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in addition to their prevalence in the population.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Sang Woo; Cornforth, Daniel M; Dushoff, Jonathan; Weitz, Joshua S","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/de3fd3cfd3a9480198e1bc24e563d87efbcbbaa5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033514","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["impact of asymptomatic transmission","asymptomatic individuals","generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission","duration of asymptomatic cases of COVID","length of asymptomatic generation intervals","realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission","shorter generation interval","expected number of secondary cases","longer generation interval","basic reproduction number","fraction of new secondary cases attributable","epidemic decrease","susceptible population","epidemic potential of novel respiratory pathogens","exponential phase","average primary case","time","addition","rationale","prevalence","analysis","person"],"language":"en"},

But there were some challenges during mNGS implementation in clinical settings such as time consuming manipulation and lack of comprehensive analytical validation. Methods: We set up CATCH that was a mNGS method based on RNA and DNA hybrid tagmentation via Tn5 transposon. Seven respiratory RNA viruses and three subtypes of Influenza A virus had been used to test capabilities of CATCH on detection and quantification. Analytical performance of SARS CoV 2 and Influenza A virus had been determined with reference standards. We compared accuracy of CATCH with quantitative real time PCR by using clinical 98 samples from 64 COVID19 patients. Results: We minimized the library preparation process to 3 hours and handling time to 35 minutes. Duplicate filtered RPM of 7 respiratory viruses and 3 Influenza A virus subtypes were highly correlated with viral concentration. LOD of SARS CoV 2 was 39.2 copies/test and of Influenza A virus was 278.1 copies/mL. Comparing with quantitative real time PCR, the overall accuracy of CATCH was 91.4%. Sensitivity was 84.5% and specificity was 100%. Meanwhile, there were significant difference of microbial profile in oropharyngeal swabs among critical, moderate patients and healthy controls. Conclusion: Although further optimization is needed before CATCH can be rolled out as a routine diagnostic test, we highlight the potential impact of it advancing molecular diagnostics for respiratory pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, F.; Yu, Y.; Hu, Z.; Wang, R.; Guo, X.; Jin, H.; Guo, S.; Ouyang, Y.; Shi, Y.; Jin, R.; Chen, D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1603a553cc87cf9766a8786d2d5652628ebd2b27.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.12.20099754v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs1OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","LOD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","virus subtypes","subtypes of Influenza","respiratory RNA viruses","capabilities of CATCH","overall accuracy of CATCH","handling time","quantitative real time PCR","respiratory pathogens","LOD of SARS CoV","Analytical performance of SARS CoV","time consuming manipulation","Acute respiratory infection","mNGS implementation","mNGS method","copies","routine diagnostic test","clinical settings","moderate patients","COVID19 patients","lack of comprehensive analytical validation","oropharyngeal swabs","hours","DNA hybrid tagmentation","significant difference of microbial profile","molecular diagnostics","samples","library preparation process","Tn5 transposon","potential impact","healthy controls","powerful tool","challenges","world","Duplicate filtered RPM","ethological diagnosis","Background","minutes","detection","quantification","main diseases","viral concentration","Results","optimization","reference standards","Sensitivity","specificity","Conclusion","Methods"],"language":"en"},

As a consequence of restrictive public health measures like isolation, quarantine, and community containment, the provision of mental health services is a major challenge. Evidence from past virus epidemics and the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak indicate high prevalence rates of mental health problems (MHP) as short- and long-term consequences. However, a broader picture of MHP among different populations is still lacking. Methods: We conducted a rapid review on MHP prevalence rates published since 2000, during and after epidemics, including the general public, health care workers, and survivors. Any quantitative articles reporting on MHP rates were included. Out of 2855 articles screened, a total of 74 were included in this review. Results: Most original studies on MHP were conducted in China in the context of SARS-CoV-1, and reported on anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms/disorder, general psychiatric morbidity, and psychological symptoms. The MHP rates across studies, populations, and epidemics vary substantially. While some studies show high and persistent rates of MHP in populations directly affected by isolation, quarantine, threat of infection, infection, or life-threatening symptoms (e.g. health care workers), other studies report minor effects. Furthermore, even less affected populations (e.g. distant to epidemic epicenter, no contact history with suspected or confirmed cases) can show high rates of MHP. Discussion: MHP vary largely across countries and risk-groups in reviewed studies. The results call attention to potentially high MHP during epidemics. Individuals affected directly by an epidemic might be at a higher risk of short or even long-term mental health impairments. This study delivers insights stemming from a wide range of psychiatric instruments and questionnaires. The results call for the use of validated and standardized instruments, reference norms, and pre-post measurements to better understand the magnitude of the MHP during and after the epidemics. Nevertheless, emerging MHP should be considered during epidemics including the provision of access to mental health care to mitigate potential mental impairments.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zuercher, S.

ARBs and/or ACEi treatments, and hypertension, diabetes, cancer, COPD, renal and major cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were extracted from clinical charts and electronic health records, up to two years before infection. The sample consisted of 1603 subjects (mean age 58.0y; 47.3% males): 454 (28.3%) had severe symptoms, 192 (12.0%) very severe or lethal disease (154 deaths; mean age 79.3 years; 70.8% hypertensive, 42.2% with CVD).

This included scheduled outpatient cardiac surgical and interventional procedures that required the use of intensive care units, ventilators, and skilled critical care personnel, given that these procedures would draw from the same pool of resources required for critically ill COVID-19 patients. We adapted the COVID-19 Resource Estimator (CORE) decision analytic model by adding a cardiac component to determine the impact of various policy decisions on the incremental waitlist growth and estimated waitlist mortality for three key groups of cardiovascular disease patients; coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias. We provided predictions based on COVID-19 epidemiology available in real-time, in 3 phases. First, in the initial crisis phase, in a worst case scenario, we showed that the potential number of waitlist related cardiac deaths would be orders of magnitude less than those who would die of COVID-19 if critical cardiac care resources were diverted to the care of COVID-19 patients. Second, with better local epidemiology data, we predicted that across five regions of Ontario, there may be insufficient resources to resume all elective outpatient cardiac procedures. Finally in the recovery phase, we showed that the estimated incremental growth in waitlist for all cardiac procedures is likely substantial. These outputs informed timely, data-driven decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the provision of cardiovascular care.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tam, Derrick Y.; Naimark, David; Natarajan, Madhu K.; Woodward, Graham; Oakes, Garth; Rahal, Mirna; Barrett, Kali; Khan, Yasin A.; Ximenes, Raphael; Mac MBiotech, Stephen; Sander, Beate; Wijeysundera, Harindra C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4a3c93ec6a9f56cea1965cca7bf3bd1d91c9f28.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0828282X20305031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0828282X20305031?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COVID-19 Resource Estimator"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["care of COVID","critical cardiac care resources","ill COVID","elective outpatient cardiac procedures","cardiac component","cardiac deaths","interventional procedures","provision of cardiovascular care","incremental waitlist growth","acute care hospitals","scheduled outpatient cardiac surgical","skilled critical care personnel","estimated waitlist mortality","potential number of waitlist","non-essential procedures","use of intensive care units","key groups of cardiovascular disease patients","estimated incremental growth","insufficient resources","pool of resources","coronary artery disease","valvular heart disease","data-driven decisions","potential surge","epidemiology available","better local epidemiology data","recovery phase","regions of Ontario","initial crisis phase","impact of various policy decisions","ventilators","decision analytic model","CORE","anticipation","Resource Estimator","pandemic","worst case scenario","words","outputs","arrhythmias","Unstructured Abstract","phases","directive","magnitude","predictions"],"language":"en"},

Here we assessed SARS-CoV2 from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia alongside sequences of SARS-CoV, bat SARS-like CoVs and MERS-CoV, the latter currently detected in this region. Phylogenetic analysis, natural selection investigation and genome recombination analysis were performed. Our analysis showed that all Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences are of the same origin and closer proximity to bat SARS-like CoVs, followed by SARS-CoVs, however quite distant to MERS-CoV. Moreover, genome recombination analysis revealed two recombination events between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-like CoVs. This was further assessed by S gene recombination analysis. These recombination events may be relevant to the emergence of this novel virus. Moreover, positive selection pressure was detected between SARS-CoV-2, bat SL-CoV isolates and human SARS-CoV isolates. However, the highest positive selection occurred between SARS-CoV-2 isolates and 2 bat-SL-CoV isolates (Bat-SL-RsSHC014 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45). This further indicates that SARS-CoV-2 isolates were adaptively evolved from bat SARS-like isolates, and that a virus with originating from bats triggered this pandemic. This study thuds sheds further light on the origin of this virus. AUTHOR SUMMARY The emergence and subsequent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is a unique challenge to countries all over the world, including Saudi Arabia where cases of the related MERS are still being reported. Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences were found to be likely of the same or similar origin. In our analysis, SARS-CoV-2 were more closely related to bat SARS-like CoVs rather than to MERS-CoV (which originated in Saudi Arabia) or SARS-CoV, confirming other phylogenetic efforts on this pathogen. Recombination and positive selection analysis further suggest that bat coronaviruses may be at the origin of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The data shown here give hints on the origin of this virus and may inform efforts on transmissibility, host adaptation and other biological aspects of this virus.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nour, Islam; Alanazi, Ibrahim O.; Hanif, Atif; Kohl, Alain; Eifan, Saleh","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66b16f35496816d1091009e6df08945485e57ffc.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.093971","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs2OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Saudi Arabia"],"keyphrases":["bat SARS","Saudi SARS-CoV","emerged SARS-CoV","SARS-CoVs","origin of SARS","sequences of SARS","human SARS-CoV isolates","MERS-CoV","SARS-CoV2","bat SL-CoV isolates","subsequent pandemic of SARS","bat-SL","bat coronaviruses","genome recombination analysis","Phylogenetic analysis","positive selection analysis","recombination events","S gene recombination analysis","Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","similar origin","novel virus","related MERS","positive selection pressure","highest positive selection","emergence","phylogenetic efforts","RsSHC014","host adaptation","transmissibility","world","cases","investigation","biological aspects","closer proximity","underlying cause of COVID","AUTHOR SUMMARY","Betacoronavirus","light","Coronaviridae","unique challenge","disease","countries","originating","bats","hints","CoVZC45","study thuds","pathogen","data","region"],"language":"en"},

Since the outbreak of severe acute and Middle East respiratory syndromes coronavirus was not reported to cause human infections. Now, it become an epidemic proportion with growing number of cases and deaths. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework. In this scoping review, 50 records published before 28 March, 2020 were included and discussed to better understand the current epidemiology, pathogenesis, immunological response, diagnosis, evasion mechanisms and suggested strategies to boost the immune system, challenges, treatment, and future preventions of the virus. PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, Global Health and google scholars were searched comprehensively for articles, preprints, grey literatures, reports, websites, conference proceedings and expert information. Studies conducted in human and published in the English language were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements of the review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in citations. Results: We identified 360 records, of which 50 studies met the inclusion criteria. We synthesized the data from the included records and dig out the deep insights of them and pooled into this review. The burden of the outbreak is worsening due to overcrowding, presence of asymptomatic carriers, scarcity of test kits, the immune escaping ability of the virus and lack of awareness. Conclusions and recommendations: Due to the fast-spreading nature of COVID-19 the prevention and control strategies become challenging. It is imposing social, psychological, and socio-economic impacts. We recommended that following social distancing, isolation suspects, using personal protective equipment, health education and introducing handwashing practices, avoiding contact with animals, vaccine development and treatment for controlling and prevention.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Berhe, Brhane; Legese, Haftom; Degefa, Hagos; Adhanom, Gebre; Gebrewahd, Aderajew; Mardu, Fitsum; Tesfay, Kebede; Welay, Miglas; Negash, Hadush","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53726a84035f04167440dde803026c996d8794c0.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.02.20051052","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs3MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Health"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["scoping review","included records","published information","health education","Global Health","treatment","respiratory infections","human infections","Studies","public health problem","outbreak of severe acute","immune system","suggested strategies","novel coronavirus","control strategies","expert information","social distancing","Middle East respiratory syndromes coronavirus","immune escaping ability","immunological response","websites","diagnosis","scarcity of test kits","personal protective equipment","reports","animals","isolation suspects","evasion mechanisms","grey literatures","conference proceedings","handwashing practices","presence of asymptomatic carriers","growing number of cases","contact","pathogenesis","MedRxiv","challenges","vaccine development","epidemic proportion","articles","preprints","current epidemiology","BioRxiv","overcrowding","scholars","future preventions","nature of COVID","deaths","PubMed","English language","socio-economic impacts","lack of awareness","statements","deep insights","methodological framework","recommendations","analysis","inclusion criteria","Background","findings","citations","Methods","data","Conclusions","Results"],"language":"en"},

Small animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 disease are desperately needed to rapidly evaluate medical countermeasures (MCMs). SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wildtype laboratory mice due to inefficient interactions between the viral spike (S) protein and the murine ortholog of the human receptor, ACE2. We used reverse genetics to remodel the S and mACE2 binding interface resulting in a recombinant virus (SARS-CoV-2 MA) that could utilize mACE2 for entry. SARS-CoV-2 MA replicated in both the upper and lower airways of both young adult and aged BALB/c mice. Importantly, disease was more severe in aged mice, and showed more clinically relevant phenotypes than those seen in hACE2 transgenic mice. We then demonstrated the utility of this model through vaccine challenge studies in immune competent mice with native expression of mACE2. Lastly, we show that clinical candidate interferon (IFN) lambda-1a can potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human airway epithelial cells in vitro, and both prophylactic and therapeutic administration diminished replication in mice.

Summary The spectrum of respiratory viruses is expanding and emerging diseases have been described regularly over the last fifteen years. The origin of these emerging respiratory viruses may be zoonotic (by crossing species barrier, after changes to RNA viruses such as avian influenza virus type A or coronaviruses), or related to the use of new identification techniques (metapneumovirus, bocavirus). The relationship between bronchiolitis and asthma is now better understood thanks to prospective follow up of birth cohorts. The role of rhinovirus has become predominant with respect to respiratory syncytial virus. The identification of predisposing factors immunological, functional, atopic and genetic, for the onset of asthma after rhinovirus infection suggests that viral infection reveals a predisposition rather than itself being a cause of asthma. The role of bacteria in the natural history of asthma is also beginning to be better understood. The results of the COPSAC Danish cohort have shown the frequency of bacterial identification during wheezy episodes before 3 years, and the impact of bacterial colonization at the age of one month on the onset of asthma by age 5 years. The role of bacterial infections in severe asthma in young children is also discussed.","publish_time":"2017-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Blic, J.; Brouard, J.; Vabret, A.; Deschildre, A.","journal":"Revue des Maladies Respiratoires","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a175bd0d34a3c0d79e4e99613d332f4013ec74fd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0761842517300311; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0761842517300311","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["The identification","The role","the onset","the impact","The origin","The results","shown the frequency","Summary The spectrum","or related to the","the COPSAC Danish cohort","described regularly over the","The relationship between bronchiolitis","bacterial colonization at the age","bacteria in the natural history","spectre des virus","virus respiratoire syncytial","r\u00F4le des rhinovirus","asthma is also beginning to be better understood","virus aviaires influenza de type","identification de facteurs","virus respiratoires \u00E9mergents","respiratory viruses is expanding","asthma after rhinovirus infection suggests that viral infection reveals","new identification techniques","become predominant with respect to respiratory syncytial virus","asthma is now better understood thanks to prospective follow","infection virale","bacterial infections in severe asthma in young children is also discussed","after changes to RNA viruses such as avian influenza virus type","r\u00F4le des infections bact\u00E9riennes","asthme s\u00E9v\u00E8re du jeune enfant","bacterial identification during wheezy episodes before","fifteen years","survenue","\u00E2ge","bocavirus","r\u00F4le des bact\u00E9ries","ans","origine","these emerging respiratory viruses may be zoonotic","emerging diseases","or coronaviruses","nouvelles techniques","tropisme respiratoire","fr\u00E9quence des identifications bact\u00E9riennes","impact de la colonisation bact\u00E9rienne","r\u00E9sultats de la cohorte danoise COPSAC","crossing species barrier","predisposition rather than itself being","atopic","month","predisposing factors immunological","functional","cause","ARN tels","genetic","rapport","pr\u00E9dispositions immunologiques","zoonotique","mutations","cohortes de nouveau","suivi prospectif","birth cohorts","franchissement de barri\u00E8re","maladies \u00E9mergentes","\u00E9pisodes sifflants","gr\u00E2ce","esp\u00E8ce","histoire naturelle","m\u00E9tapneumovirus","metapneumovirus","mois","quinzaine","R\u00E9sum\u00E9","ann\u00E9es","terrain","bronchiolite"],"language":"fr"},

Also, mass group testing is not used regardless to existing shortage of tests. I propose new strategy for early detection of superspreaders with reasonable number of RT-PCR tests, which can dramatically mitigate development COVID-19 pandemic and even turn it endemic. Methods I used stochastic social-epidemiological SEIAR model, where S-suspected, E-exposed, I-infectious, A-admitted (confirmed COVID-19 positive, who are admitted to hospital or completely isolated), R-recovered. The model was applied to real COVID-19 dynamics in London, Moscow and New York City. Findings Viral loading data measured by RT-PCR were fitted by broad log-normal distribution, which governed high importance of superspreaders. The proposed full scale model of a metropolis shows that top 10% spreaders (100\u002B higher viral loading than median infector) transmit 45% of new cases. Rapid isolation of superspreaders leads to 4-8 fold mitigation of pandemic depending on applied quarantine strength and amount of currently infected people. High viral loading allows efficient group matrix pool testing of population focused on detection of the superspreaders requiring remarkably small amount of tests. Interpretation The model and new testing strategy may prevent thousand or millions COVID-19 deaths requiring just about 5000 daily RT-PCR test for big 12 million city such as Moscow.

Observation model accounts for delays in reporting cases and deaths. Model parameters were initially estimated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, by using the data of the city of Rio de Janeiro from February 28, 2020 to April 29, 2020. These estimations were used as initial input values for the solution of the state estimation problem for the city of Rio de Janeiro. Algorithm of Liu \u0026 West for the Particle Filter was used for the solution of the state estimation problem because it allows the simultaneous estimation of state variables and model parameters. State estimation problem was solved with the data of the city of Rio de Janeiro, from February 28, 2020 to May 05, 2020. Monte Carlo simulations were run for 20 future days, considering uncertainties in the model parameters and state variables. Initial conditions were given by the state variables and corresponding distributions estimated with the particle filter on May 05, 2020.

Data of the city of Rio de Janeiro, from May 06, 2020 to May 15, 2020, were used for the validation of the solution of the state estimation problem. The present model, with the parameters obtained with the Particle Filter, accurately fits the number of reported cases and the number of reported deaths, for 10 days ahead of the period used for the solution of the state estimation problem.

However, as yet, there is limited understanding of its impact on the mental health of the general population. The aim of this study is to examine the mental health of the Japanese general population by conducting the first systematic survey during the pandemic (N=1,000), with a particular focus on identifying the most vulnerable groups. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that the mental health of young and middle-aged individuals was significantly worse than that of older individuals during the pandemic. There was also some indication that individuals who were not currently working were significantly more likely to report a high level of anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Mathematical modelling of reported and unreported COVID-19 infected cases","doi":"10.1101/2020.05.21.20108621","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"medrxiv","abstract":"Starting from the city of Wuhan in China in late December 2019, the pandemic quickly spread to the rest of the world along the main intercontinental air routes. At the time of writing this article, there are officially about five million infections and more than 300 000 deaths. Statistics vary widely from country to country, revealing significant differences in anticipation and management of the crisis. We propose to examine the COVID-19 epidemic in Tunisia through mathematical models, which aim to determine the actual number of infected cases and to predict the course of the epidemic. As of May 11, 2020, there are officially 1032 COVID-19 infected cases in Tunisia. 45 people have died. Using a mathematical model based on the number of reported infected cases, the number of deaths, and the effect of the 18-day delay between infection and death, this study estimates the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Tunisia as 2555 cases. This paper analyses the evolution of the epidemic in Tunisia using population dynamics with an SEIR model combining susceptible cases S(t), asymptomatic infected cases A(t), reported infected cases V (t), and unreported infected cases U(t). This work measures the basic reproduction number R0, which is the average number of people infected by a COVID-19 infected person. The model predicts an R0 = 2.73. Strict containment measures have led to a significant reduction in the reproduction rate. Contact tracing and respect for isolation have an impact: at the current time, we compute that Tunisia has an Rt = 0.42 (95% CI 0.14-0.70). These values depend on physical separation and can vary over time depending on the management of suspicious cases. Their objective estimation and the study of their evolution are however necessary to understand the pandemic and to reduce their unintended damage (due to an absence of symptoms, or the confusion of certain symptoms with less contagious diseases, or unavailable or unreliable tests).","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abdeljaoued-Tej, I.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/811f5517c169b6d7fdf5823bae1f8d6b8850395a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.21.20108621v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs4NzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SEIR"],"locations":["Wuhan","China","Tunisia"],"keyphrases":["actual number of infected cases","asymptomatic infected cases","infected cases V","unreported infected cases U","Tunisia","infected person","management of suspicious cases","susceptible cases S","actual number of COVID","number of deaths","average number of people","epidemic","basic reproduction number R0","country","study","SEIR model","evolution","current time","pandemic","significant differences","significant reduction","absence of symptoms","reproduction rate","mathematical models","confusion of certain symptoms","Strict containment measures","contagious diseases","population dynamics","world","anticipation","main intercontinental air routes","respect","isolation","day delay","impact","effect","work","unreliable tests","city of Wuhan","China","Contact tracing","unintended damage","rest","physical separation","course","objective estimation","values","crisis","Statistics","paper","infections","article"],"language":"en"},

Within a few weeks, the disease caused by SARA-CoV-2, which is named COVID-19, has escalated into an unprecedented ongoing outbreak with frightening speed, becoming a global health emergency. This study aimed to exam the prevalence and risk factors of acute posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Chinese people shortly after the massive outbreak of COVID-19. Method An online anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted in mainland China between 30 January and 3 February, 2020. The survey consisted of two self-administered questionnaires: one was designed to require personal information (gender, age, education background), current location, recent exposure history of Wuhan, the classification of population, and subjective sleep quality; the other was the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), which was to assess PTSS referring to the outbreak. Results A total of 2091 Chinese participated in the current study. The prevalence of PTSS among the public in mainland China 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 4.6%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that gender (p \u003C 0.001), exposure history of Wuhan (p = 0.047), classification of population (p \u003C 0.001), and subjective sleep quality (p \u003C 0.001) could be regarded as predictor factors for PTSS. Conclusions The results showed that some Chinese showed acute PTSS during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, comprehensive psychological intervention needs further implementation. Furthermore, females, people who having recent exposure history of Wuhan, those at high risk of infection or with poor sleep quality deserve special attention.","publish_time":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Luna; Sun, Zhuoer; Wu, Lili; Zhu, Zhenwen; Zhang, Fan; Shang, Zhilei; Jia, Yanpu; Gu, Jingwen; Zhou, Yaoguang; Wang, Yan; Liu, Nianqi; Liu, Weizhi","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032425","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMxLmNzdjs5MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1996437,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:01Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"jf2m71ytt1MZp6uTqwdXUA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_31.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PTSS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["acute PTSS","prevalence of PTSS","massive outbreak of COVID","recent exposure history of Wuhan","subjective sleep quality","Chinese people","mainland China","poor sleep quality","unprecedented ongoing outbreak","gender","classification of population","current study","SARA-CoV","results","risk factors of acute posttraumatic stress symptoms","current location","education background","predictor factors","high risk of infection","online anonymous questionnaire survey","frightening speed","age","public","month","Multiple linear regression analysis","Method","special attention","exam","global health emergency","personal information","DSM","comprehensive psychological intervention","implementation","PTSD Checklist","disease","novel coronavirus","females","PCL","self-administered questionnaires","weeks","Conclusions","total"],"language":"en"},

Without effective treatments, outbreaks in such facilities will become commonplace and will result in severe morbidity and mortality. The effectiveness of doxycycline (DOXY) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) combination therapy in high risk COVID-19 patients in long-term care facilities is not yet understood. Objective: The goal of this analysis is to describe outcomes after use of DOXY-HCQ combination in high-risk COVID-19 patients in LTCF. Design: Case-series analysis. Setting: Three (3) LTCFs in New York. Participants: From March 19 to March 30, 2020, fifty-four (54) patients, residents of three (3) LTCFs in New York and diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19, were included in this analysis. Exposure: All patients who were diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19 received DOXY-HCQ combination therapy along with standard of care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients characteristics, clinical recovery, radiological improvements, medication side-effects, hospital transfer, and death were assessed as outcome measures. Results: A series of fifty-four (54) high-risk patients, who developed a sudden onset of fever, cough, and shortness of breath (SOB) and were diagnosed or presumed to have COVID-19, were started with a combination of DOXY-HCQ and 85% (n=46) patients showed clinical recovery defined as: resolution of fever and SOB, or a return to baseline setting if patients are ventilator-dependent. A total of 11% (n=6) patients were transferred to acute care hospitals due to clinical deterioration and 6% (n=3) patients died in the facilities.

Mortalities can reach 100% and have resulted in an 80% decline in the number of hatcheries actively producing M. rosenbergii. To investigate a causative agent for the mortalities, a disease challenge was carried out using infected material from a hatchery experiencing mortalities. Moribund larvae from the challenge were prepared for metatranscriptomic sequencing. De novo virus assembly revealed a 29 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with similarities in key protein motif sequences to yellow head virus (YHV), an RNA virus that causes mass mortalities in marine shrimp aquaculture, and other viruses in the Nidovirales order. Primers were designed against the novel virus and used to screen cDNA from larvae sampled from hatcheries in the South of Bangladesh from two consecutive years. Larvae from all hatcheries screened from both years were positive by PCR for the novel virus, including larvae from a hatchery that at the point of sampling appeared healthy, but later experienced mortalities. These screens suggest that the virus is widespread in M. rosenbergii hatchery culture in southern Bangladesh, and that early detection of the virus can be achieved by PCR. The hypothesised protein motifs of MrGV suggest that it is likely to be a new species within the Nidovirales order.

Ambra1 regulates the targeting of active phospho-Src away from focal adhesions into autophagic structures that cancer cells use to survive adhesion stress. Ambra1 binds to both FAK and Src in cancer cells. When FAK is present, Ambra1 is recruited to focal adhesions, promoting FAK-regulated cancer cell direction-sensing and invasion. However, when Ambra1 cannot bind to FAK, abnormally high levels of phospho-Src and phospho-FAK accumulate at focal adhesions, positively regulating adhesion and invasive migration. Spatial control of active Src requires the trafficking proteins Dynactin one and IFITM3, which we identified as Ambra1 binding partners by interaction proteomics. We conclude that Ambra1 is a core component of an intracellular trafficking network linked to tight spatial control of active Src and FAK levels, and so crucially regulates their cancer-associated biological outputs.

The conversion of Ang II to the septapeptide Ang-(1-7) is of particular interest as the latter also confers organ protection. The conversion is catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and other enzymes that selectively cleave the peptide bond between the proline and the phenylalanine at the carboxyl terminus of Ang II. The contribution of various enzyme activities that collectively lead to the formation of Ang-(1-7) from Ang II, in both normal conditions and in disease states, remains only partially understood. This is largely due to the lack of a reliable and sensitive method to detect these converting activities in complex samples, such as blood and tissues. Here, we report a fluorometric method to measure carboxypeptidase activities that cleave the proline-phenylalanine dipeptide bond in Ang II. This method is also suitable for measuring the conversion of apelin-13. The assay detects the release of phenylalanine amino acid in a reaction with the yeast enzyme of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL).

In conclusion, H(2)S could ameliorate adenine-induced CRF in rats by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation through ROS/mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways.","publish_time":"2017-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Dongdong; Luo, Ning; Wang, Lianqu; Zhao, Zhijun; Bu, Hongmin; Xu, Guoliang; Yan, Yongjun; Che, Xinping; Jiao, Zhiling; Zhao, Tengfu; Chen, Jingtao; Ji, Ailing; Li, Yanzhang; Lee, Garrick D.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9700deed61ea92d41891cf29eccddac0ee0ca15.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5428696.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5428696/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["kidney of CRF rats","function of CRF rats","protein levels of p50","protein levels of Bax","adenine-induced CRF","S alleviated gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity","mitogen-activated protein kinase","kidney structure","levels of malondialdehyde","monocyte chemoattractant protein","normal rat kidney","phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase","Caspase","expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","N-terminal kinase","mediated apoptosis","p-p65","expression of Bcl","Chronic renal failure","nuclear factor-kappa B","reactive oxygen species","p38","important roles","activities of superoxide dismutase","interleukin","inflammation","pathophysiological processes","glutathione peroxidase","pathways","major public health problem","E cells","Hydrogen sulfide","Treatment","conclusion","study"],"language":"en"},

The structure of the postfusion conformation of gB has been solved for several herpesviruses; however, the gB prefusion crystal structure and the details of how the protein refolds from a prefusion to a postfusion form to mediate fusion have not been determined. Using structure-based mutagenesis, we previously reported that three mutations (I671A, H681A, and F683A) in the C-terminal arm of the gB ectodomain greatly reduced cell-cell fusion. This fusion deficit could be rescued by the addition of a hyperfusogenic mutation, suggesting that the gB triple mutant was not misfolded. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), we constructed two independent herpes simplex virus 1 mutant strains (gB 3A) carrying the three arm mutations. The gB 3A viruses have 200-fold smaller plaques than the wild-type virus and demonstrate remarkably delayed entry into cells. Single-step and multistep growth curves show that gB 3A viruses have delayed replication kinetics. Interestingly, incubation at 40\u00B0C promoted the entry of the gB 3A viruses. We propose that the gB 3A viruses\u2019 entry deficit is due to a loss of interactions between residues in the gB C-terminal arm and the coiled-coil core of gB. The results suggest that the triple alanine mutation may destabilize the postfusion gB conformation and/or stabilize the prefusion gB conformation and that exposure to elevated temperatures can overcome the defect in gB 3A viruses.","publish_time":"2017-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Qing; Kopp, Sarah J.; Connolly, Sarah A.; Longnecker, Richard","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/798d2643cbdd17b150ec009bd4b735e08f8f8e40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5433099.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5433099/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzU1NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gB ectodomain","prefusion gB conformation","postfusion conformation of gB","postfusion gB conformation","gB triple mutant","gB C-terminal arm","gB prefusion crystal structure","coiled-coil core of gB","delayed entry","fusion deficit","entry of herpesviruses","arm mutations","viruses\u2019 entry deficit","reduced cell-cell fusion","postfusion form","conserved herpesvirus fusion protein","triple alanine mutation","structure-based mutagenesis","mutant strains","hyperfusogenic mutation","wild-type virus","delayed replication kinetics","independent herpes simplex virus","multistep growth curves","elevated temperatures","residues","exposure","details","smaller plaques","Single-step","F683A","loss of interactions","defect","bacterial artificial chromosome","I671A","H681A","addition","results","Glycoprotein B","cells","incubation"],"language":"en"},

We previously demonstrated exacerbation of JE following CD11c(hi) dendritic cell (DC) ablation in CD11c-DTR transgenic mice. Moreover, CD11c(hi) DC ablation led to abnormal differentiation of CD11b(\u002B)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and enhanced permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in promoting the progression of JE. Here, we examined changes in lymphoid and myeloid-derived leukocyte subpopulations associated with pro- and anti-inflammation during JE progression. The analyses of this study focused on regulatory CD4(\u002B)Foxp3(\u002B) regulatory T cells (Tregs), IL-17(\u002B)CD4(\u002B) Th17 cells, and CD11b(\u002B)Ly-6C(hi) and Ly-6C(lo) monocytes. CD11c(hi) DC ablation resulted in the accumulation of IL-17(\u002B)CD4(\u002B) Th17 cells in the CNS, thereby leading to lower ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells. This result was corroborated by the higher expression levels of IL-17 and ROR\u03B3T in CD4(\u002B) T cells from the brains of CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice. In addition, CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice showed higher frequency and total number of inflammatory CD11b(\u002B)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes, whereas CD11b(\u002B)Ly-6C(lo) monocytes were detected with lower frequency and total number in CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice.

As a vital component of the host innate immune system, the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing receptor, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a critical role against H1N1 viral infection. However, the function of NLRP3 inflammasome in host immunological responses to the lethal H7N9 virus is still obscure. Here, we demonstrated that mice deficient for NLRP3 inflammasome components, including NLRP3, caspase-1, and Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), were less susceptible to H7N9 viral challenge than wild type (WT) controls. Inflammasome deficiency in these animals led to significantly milder mortality and less pulmonary inflammation compared with WT mice. Furthermore, IL-1 receptor deficient mice also exhibited a higher survival rate than WT controls. Thus, our study reveals that the NLRP3 inflammasome is deleterious for the host during H7N9 infection in mice, which is due to an overwhelming inflammatory response via caspase-1 activation and associated IL-1 signal. Therefore, fine-tuning the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome or IL-1 signaling may be beneficial for the host to control H7N9 associated lethal pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2017-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Rongrong; Wu, Shuxian; Cai, Jialin; Yang, Yuqin; Ren, Xiaonan; Feng, Yanling; Chen, Lixiang; Qin, Boyin; Xu, Chunhua; Yang, Hua; Song, Zhigang; Tian, Di; Hu, Yunwen; Zhou, Xiaohui; Meng, Guangxun","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e54de72c3927b67883b14ac669e30b8b3bb4282e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5548739.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5548739/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzY2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NLRP3 inflammasome components","function of NLRP3 inflammasome","activity of NLRP3 inflammasome","H7N9 infection","WT mice","Inflammasome deficiency","associated IL","lethal H7N9 virus","mice deficient","H7N9 viral challenge","receptor deficient mice","WT controls","host immunological responses","caspase","Apoptosis-associated speck","H1N1 viral infection","pyrin domain","lethal pathogenesis","nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat","wild type","immune system","IAV","activation","higher survival rate","critical role","considerable number of human infections","high rates of death","protein","pulmonary inflammation","avian origin influenza","milder mortality","animals","overwhelming inflammatory response","vital component","CARD","ASC","emergence","signal","study"],"language":"en"},

Fluorescent signal was generated from the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 hydrolysis of HFman probe by HF DNA polymerase before elongation initiation. Mismatches between probe/primer and template have less influence on the amplification efficiency of the new method.

METHODS: Eight electronic databases (Embase, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, PsycArticles, The Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, and Google Scholar) were searched. All study designs were included, and no date limits were set. Studies were included if they were published in English, and explored the psychological health of any EDC operatives, across fire, police, and emergency medical services. Studies were excluded if they related solely to other emergency workers, such as police officers or paramedics. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using checklists adapted from the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. A narrative synthesis was conducted, using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 16 articles were included in the review. Two overarching themes were identified during the narrative synthesis: \u2018Organisational and Operational Factors\u2019 and \u2018Interactions with Others\u2019. Stressors identified included being exposed to traumatic calls, lacking control over high workload, and working in under-resourced and pressured environments. Lack of support from management and providing an emotionally demanding service were additional sources of stress. Peer support and social support from friends and family were helpful in managing work-related stress. DISCUSSION: EDC operatives experience stress as a result of their work, which appears to be related to negative psychological health outcomes. Future research should explore the long-term effects of this stress, and the potential for workplace interventions to alleviate the negative impacts on psychological health.

The present study compares the kinetics of [(18)F]FDG and three other PET tracers with relevance for infection imaging. METHODS: A juvenile porcine osteomyelitis model was used. Eleven pigs underwent PET/CT with 60-minute dynamic PET imaging of [(18)F]FDG, [(68)Ga]Ga-citrate, [(11)C]methionine, and/or [(11)C]donepezil, along with blood sampling. For infectious lesions, kinetic modelling with one- and two-tissue-compartment models was conducted for each tracer. RESULTS: Irreversible uptake was found for [(18)F]FDG and [(68)Ga]Ga-citrate; reversible uptake was found for [(11)C]methionine (two-tissue model) and [(11)C]donepezil (one-tissue model). The uptake rate for [(68)Ga]Ga-citrate was slow and diffusion-limited. For the other tracers, the uptake rate was primarily determined by perfusion (flow-limited uptake). Net uptake rate for [(18)F]FDG and distribution volume for [(11)C]methionine were significantly higher for infectious lesions than for correspondingly noninfected tissue. For [(11)C]donepezil in pigs, labelled metabolite products appeared to be important for the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The kinetics of the four studied tracers in infection was characterized. For clinical applications, [(18)F]FDG remains the first-choice PET tracer. [(11)C]methionine may have a potential for detecting soft tissue infections. [(68)Ga]Ga-citrate and [(11)C]donepezil were not found useful for imaging of osteomyelitis.","publish_time":"2017-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"J\u00F8dal, Lars; Jensen, Svend B.; Nielsen, Ole L.; Afzelius, Pia; Borghammer, Per; Alstrup, Aage K.

To induce protective responses against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\u2014a highly prevalent childhood pathogen without a licensed vaccine\u2014we previously engineered a pre-fusion-stabilized trimeric RSV F (pre-F) \u201CDS-Cav1\u201D immunogen, which induced high titer RSV-neutralizing antibodies, in mice and non-human primates, when formulated with adjuvants Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC), respectively. To assess the impact of different adjuvants, here we formulated RSV F DS-Cav1 with multiple adjuvants and assessed immune responses. Very high RSV-neutralizing antibody responses (19,006 EC(50)) were observed in na\u00EFve mice immunized with 2 doses of DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Sigma adjuvant system (SAS), an oil-in-water adjuvant, plus Carbopol; high responses (3658\u20137108) were observed with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with Alum, SAS alone, Adjuplex, Poly (I:C) and Poly (IC:LC); and moderate responses (1251\u20132129) were observed with DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with the TLR4 agonist MPLA, Alum plus MPLA or AddaVax. In contrast, DS-Cav1 without adjuvant induced low-level responses (6). A balanced IgG1 and IgG2a (Th2/Th1) immune response was elicited in most of the high to very high response groups (all but Alum and Adjuplex). We also tested the immune response induced by DS-Cav1 in elderly mice with pre-existing DS-Cav1 immunity; we observed that DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with SAS plus Carbopol boosted the response 2-3-fold, whereas DS-Cav1 adjuvanted with alum boosted the response 5-fold. Finally, we tested whether a mixture of ISA 71 VG and Carbopol would enhanced the antibody response in DS-Cav1 immunized calves. While pre-F-stabilized bovine RSV F induced very high titers in mice when adjuvanted with SAS plus Carbopol, the addition of Carbopol to ISA 71 VG did not enhance immune responses in calves. The vaccine response to pre-F-stabilized RSV F is augmented by adjuvant, but the degree of adjuvant-induced enhancement appears to be both context-dependent and species-specific.","publish_time":"2017-10-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sastry, Mallika; Zhang, Baoshan; Chen, Man; Joyce, M.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated experiences in preparedness among stakeholders of both curative and public health sectors to formulate recommendations for optimizing preparedness protocols. Timeliness of referred patients with suspected EVD was used as indicator for preparedness. DESIGN: In focus group sessions and semistructured interviews, experiences of curative and public health stakeholders about the regional and national process of preparedness and response were listed. Timeliness recordings of all referred patients with suspected EVD (13) were collected from first date of illness until arrival in the referral academic hospital. RESULTS: Ebola preparedness was considered extensive compared with the risk of an actual patient, however necessary. Regional coordination varied between regions. More standardization of regional preparation and operational guidelines was requested, as well as nationally standardized contingency criteria, and the National Centre for Infectious Disease Control was expected to coordinate the development of these guidelines. For the timeliness of referred patients with suspected EVD, the median delay between first date of illness until triage was 2.0 days (range: 0-10 days), and between triage and arrival in the referral hospital, it was 5.0 hours (range: 2-7.5 hours). In none of these patients Ebola infection was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Coordination between the public health sector and the curative sector needs improvement to reduce delay in patient management in emerging infectious diseases. Standardization of preparedness and response practices, through guidelines for institutional preparedness and blueprints for regional and national coordination, is necessary, as preparedness for emerging infectious diseases needs a multidisciplinary approach overarching both the public health sector and the curative sector. In the Netherlands a national platform for preparedness is established, in which both the curative sector and public health sector participate, in order to implement the outcomes of this study.","publish_time":"2017-11-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Swaan, Corien M.; \u00D6ry, Alexander V.; Schol, Lianne G.

Recent studies suggest that ZIKV can also be transmitted sexually, further increasing the exposure risk for this virus. Associated with this spread is a dramatic increase in cases of microcephaly and additional congenital abnormalities in infants of ZIKV-infected mothers, as well as a rise in the occurrence of Guillain Barre\u2019 syndrome in infected adults. Importantly, there are no licensed therapies or vaccines against ZIKV infection. In this study, we generate and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of a novel, synthetic, DNA vaccine targeting the pre-membrane\u002Benvelope proteins (prME) of ZIKV. Following initial in vitro development and evaluation studies of the plasmid construct, mice and non-human primates were immunised with this prME DNA-based immunogen through electroporation-mediated enhanced DNA delivery. Vaccinated animals were found to generate antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity and neutralisation activity. In mice lacking receptors for interferon (IFN)-\u03B1/\u03B2 (designated IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212)) immunisation with this DNA vaccine induced, following in vivo viral challenge, 100% protection against infection-associated weight loss or death in addition to preventing viral pathology in brain tissue. In addition, passive transfer of non-human primate anti-ZIKV immune serum protected IFNAR(\u2212/\u2212) mice against subsequent viral challenge. This study in NHP and in a pathogenic mouse model supports the importance of immune responses targeting prME in ZIKV infection and suggests that additional research on this vaccine approach may have relevance for ZIKV control and disease prevention in humans.","publish_time":"2016-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Muthumani, Karuppiah; Griffin, Bryan D; Agarwal, Sangya; Kudchodkar, Sagar B; Reuschel, Emma L; Choi, Hyeree; Kraynyak, Kimberly A; Duperret, Elizabeth K; Keaton, Amelia Anne; Chung, Christopher; Kim, Yinho K; Booth, Stephanie A; Racine, Trina; Yan, Jian; Morrow, Matthew P; Jiang, Jingjing; Lee, Brian; Ramos, Stephanie; Broderick, Kate E; Reed, Charles C; Khan, Amir S; Humeau, Laurent; Ugen, Kenneth E; Park, Young K; Maslow, Joel N; Sardesai, Niranjan Y; Joseph Kim, J; Kobinger, Gary P; Weiner, David B","journal":"NPJ Vaccines","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3cff423d90d10aed4310a7d726a6a873d37b2693.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5707885.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5707885/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozc4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Guillain Barre"],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZIKV infection","infants of ZIKV","ZIKV control","DNA vaccine","mice","prME DNA-based immunogen","passive transfer of non-human primate anti-ZIKV immune serum","vaccine approach","rapid global spread of infection","infection-associated weight loss","viral pathology","enhanced DNA delivery","subsequent viral challenge","study","non-human primates","additional research","disease prevention","evaluation studies","infected adults","infected mothers","designated IFNAR","Recent studies","Zika virus","importance of immune responses","additional congenital abnormalities","cases of microcephaly","plasmid construct","electroporation","death","pre-membrane","humoral immunity","relevance","protection","antigen-specific cellular","occurrence of Guillain Barre","pathogenic mouse model","envelope proteins","owing","syndrome","mosquito","neutralisation activity","dramatic increase","rise","NHP","development","interferon","novel","humans","licensed therapies","vaccines","brain tissue","receptors","Significant concerns","Vaccinated animals","efficacy","exposure risk","immunisation"],"language":"en"},

The outbreak magnitude and occurrence of multiple Ebola cases in at least seven countries beyond Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, hinted at the possibility of broad-scale transmission of Ebola. MAIN TEXT: Using a modeling tool developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Ebola outbreak, we estimated the number of Ebola cases that might have occurred had the disease spread beyond the three countries in West Africa to cities in other countries at high risk for disease transmission (based on late 2014 air travel patterns). We estimated Ebola cases in three scenarios: a delayed response, a Liberia-like response, and a fast response scenario. Based on our estimates of the number of Ebola cases that could have occurred had Ebola spread to other countries beyond the West African foci, we emphasize the need for improved levels of preparedness and response to public health threats, which is the goal of the Global Health Security Agenda. Our estimates suggest that Ebola could have potentially spread widely beyond the West Africa foci, had local and international health workers and organizations not committed to a major response effort. Our results underscore the importance of rapid detection and initiation of an effective, organized response, and the challenges faced by countries with limited public health systems. Actionable lessons for strengthening local public health systems in countries at high risk of disease transmission include increasing health personnel, bolstering primary and critical healthcare facilities, developing public health infrastructure (e.g. laboratory capacity), and improving disease surveillance. With stronger local public health systems infectious disease outbreaks would still occur, but their rapid escalation would be considerably less likely, minimizing the impact of public health threats such as Ebola. CONCLUSIONS: The Ebola outbreak could have potentially spread to other countries, where limited public health surveillance and response capabilities may have resulted in additional foci. Health security requires robust local health systems that can rapidly detect and effectively respond to an infectious disease outbreak.

Here, we validate various scores supposed to predict mortality and develop an optimized categorical model. METHODS: In a derivation cohort, 108 ARDS patients (2010\u20132015) on veno-venous ECMO were retrospectively analysed to assess four established risk scores (ECMOnet-Score, RESP-Score, PRESERVE-Score, Roch-Score) for mortality prediction (receiver operating characteristic analysis) and to identify by multivariable logistic regression analysis independent variables for mortality to yield the new PRESET-Score (PREdiction of Survival on ECMO Therapy-Score). This new score was then validated both in independent internal (n = 82) and external (n = 59) cohorts. RESULTS: The median (25%; 75% quartile) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 14 (12; 16), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 62.5 (57; 72.8), median intensive care unit stay was 17 days (range 1\u2013124), and mortality was 62%. Only the ECMOnet-Score (area under curve (AUC) 0.69) and the RESP-Score (AUC 0.64) discriminated survivors and non-survivors. Admission pH(a), mean arterial pressure, lactate, platelet concentrations, and pre-ECMO hospital stay were independent predictors of death and were used to build the PRESET-Score. The score\u2019s internal (AUC 0.845; 95% CI 0.76\u20130.93; p \u003C 0.001) and external (AUC 0.70; 95% CI 0.56\u20130.84; p = 0.008) validation revealed excellent discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: While our data confirm that both the ECMOnet-Score and the RESP-Score predict mortality in ECMO-treated ARDS patients, we propose a novel model also incorporating extrapulmonary variables, the PRESET-Score. This score predicts mortality much better than previous scores and therefore is a more precise choice for decision support in ARDS patients to be placed on ECMO.","publish_time":"2017-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hilder, Michael; Herbstreit, Frank; Adamzik, Michael; Beiderlinden, Martin; B\u00FCrschen, Markus; Peters, J\u00FCrgen; Frey, Ulrich H.","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d69c6ce8184ae8b05cb2be5818e26c2f4f02178.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5728043.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5728043/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzgxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","ECMO","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RESP-Score","ECMOnet-Score","new score","Roch-Score","PRESERVE-Score","ECMO Therapy-Score","new PRESET-Score","Acute Physiology Score","mortality prediction","Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score","AUC","ECMO-treated ARDS patients","veno-venous ECMO","pre-ECMO hospital stay","previous scores","various scores","multivariable logistic regression analysis independent variables","independent predictors of death","established risk scores","PREdiction of Survival","extrapulmonary variables","characteristic analysis","novel model","non-survivors","score\u2019s internal","median intensive care unit stay","optimized categorical model","acute respiratory distress syndrome","platelet concentrations","lactate","days","quartile","precise choice","decision support","life","receiver","arterial pressure","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","BACKGROUND","derivation cohort","area","curve","validation","range","excellent discrimination","METHODS","data","complications","cohorts","Admission pH","CONCLUSIONS","costs","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Background Surveillance for influenza viruses within live bird markets (LBMs) has been recognized as an effective tool for detecting circulating avian influenza viruses (AIVs). In Sub\u2010Saharan Africa, limited data exist on AIVs in animal hosts, and in Kenya the presence of influenza virus in animal hosts has not been described. Objectives This surveillance project aimed to detect influenza A virus in poultry traded in five LBMs in Kenya. Methods We visited each market monthly and collected oropharyngeal and cloacal specimens from poultry and environmental specimens for virological testing for influenza A by real time RT\u2010PCR. On each visit, we collected information on the number and types of birds in each market, health status of the birds, and market practices. Results During March 24, 2009\u2013February 28, 2011, we collected 5221 cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs. Of the 5199 (99\u00B76%) specimens tested, influenza A virus was detected in 42 (0\u00B78%), including 35/4166 (0\u00B78%) specimens from chickens, 3/381 (0\u00B78%) from turkeys, and 4/335 (1\u00B72%) from geese. None of the 317 duck specimens were positive. Influenza was more commonly detected in oropharyngeal [33 (1\u00B73%)] than in cloacal [9 (0\u00B74%)] specimens. None of the 485 environmental specimens were positive. Virus was detected in all five markets during most (14/22) of the months. Ducks and geese were kept longer at the market (median 30 days) than chickens (median 2 days). Conclusions Influenza A was detected in a small percentage of poultry traded in LBMs in Kenya. Efforts should be made to promote practices that could limit the maintenance and transmission of AIVs in LBMs.","publish_time":"2012-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Munyua, Peninah M.; Githinji, Jane W.; Waiboci, Lilian W.; Njagi, Leonard M.; Arunga, Geoffrey; Mwasi, Lydia; Murithi Mbabu, R.; Macharia, Joseph M.; Breiman, Robert F.; Kariuki Njenga, M.; Katz, Mark A.","journal":"Influenza Other Respir Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16519fe598d255bb46c40f7f08d79bf21b3a7ff2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5780755.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5780755/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["Detection of influenza","Conclusions Influenza","presence of influenza virus","cloacal specimens","avian influenza viruses","environmental specimens","LBMs","Kenya","duck specimens","market practices","market monthly","live bird markets","animal hosts","Respiratory Viruses","transmission of AIVs","days","chickens","oropharyngeal swabs","geese","small percentage of poultry","types of birds","surveillance project","Background Surveillance","limited data","virological testing","real time RT","Sub\u2010Saharan Africa","health status","maintenance","effective tool","information","PCR","number","Munyua","Objectives","Methods","paper","visit","Ducks","Efforts","turkeys","months","Results"],"language":"en"},

Tobacco smoking remains the most important risk factor for both cancer and heart diseases. This study was initiated due to the lack of published data concerning the real progress in research output in the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for tobacco cessation. This study was aimed to use bibliometric analysis to estimate the NRT literature indexed in Scopus database at global level. METHODS: Core of the search strategy was the documents that contained specific words or phrases regarding NRT as keywords in the title. Publication output of most prolific countries was adjusted to the gross domestic product and population size. All citations analysis were accomplished on December 22, 2017. RESULTS: A total of 2138 references were retrieved and published from 56 countries, which were published between 1970 and 2016. The USA has the most number of published articles accounted to 986, followed by the UK (312 publications) and then Australia (102 publications), and Sweden (102 publications). No data related to NRT were published from 156 countries. No significant correlation was found between the country population size or 2016 gross domestic product values and the number of publications of the top-10 most prolific countries in the field of NRT (r = \u2212 0.156, P = 0.664; and r = \u2212 0.173, P = 0.632, respectively). Furthermore, there is no correlation between prevalence of tobacco smoking and number of publications of the top-10 most prolific countries in the field of NRT (r = \u2212 0.235, P = 0.514). CONCLUSIONS: The present data reveal a solid mass of research activity on NRT. The USA was by far the predominant country in the amount of NRT-based research activity. NRT-based research activities were low or not available in most countries. The results of this study delineate a framework for better understanding the situations of current NRT research and prospective directions of the research in this field which could be applied for managing and prioritizing future research efforts in NRT research.","publish_time":"2018-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zyoud, Sa\u2019ed H.","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c0beb565af7a9bcad425207e8b5141540ff3778.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5791372.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5791372/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NRT","USA","UK"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["field of NRT","NRT literature","NRT-based research activity","NRT-based research activities","situations of current NRT research","research output","prolific countries","number of publications","Tobacco use","future research efforts","solid mass of research activity","lack of published data","number of published articles","study","tobacco cessation","prevalence of tobacco smoking","country population size","present data","RESULTS","USA","gross domestic product values","use of nicotine replacement therapy","Publication output","predominant country","bibliometric analysis","significant correlation","citations analysis","real progress","prospective directions","important risk factor","cancer","documents","Scopus database","phrases","specific words","search strategy","major healthcare problem","keywords","heart diseases","global level","METHODS","Core","framework","BACKGROUND","total","references","CONCLUSIONS","title","Australia","Sweden","UK"],"language":"en"},

To date the mechanism for how MxA exerts its antiviral activity is unclear, however, additional cellular factors are believed to be essential for this activity. To identify MxA cofactors we performed a genome-wide siRNA-based screen in human airway epithelial cells (A549) constitutively expressing MxA using an H5N1 reporter virus. These data were complemented with a proteomic screen to identify MxA-interacting proteins. The combined data identified SMARCA2, the ATPase subunit of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, as a crucial factor required for the antiviral activity of MxA against IAV. Intriguingly, our data demonstrate that although SMARCA2 is essential for expression of some IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and the establishment of an antiviral state, it is not required for expression of MxA, suggesting an indirect effect on MxA activity. Transcriptome analysis of SMARCA2-depleted A549-MxA cells identified a small set of SMARCA2-regulated factors required for activity of MxA, in particular IFITM2 and IGFBP3. These findings reveal that several virus-inducible factors work in concert to enable MxA restriction of IAV.","publish_time":"2018-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dornfeld, Dominik; Dudek, Alexandra H.; Vausselin, Thibaut; G\u00FCnther, Sira C.; Hultquist, Judd F.; Giese, Sebastian; Khokhlova-Cubberley, Daria; Chew, Yap C.; Pache, Lars; Krogan, Nevan J.; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo; Schwemmle, Martin; Shaw, Megan L.","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39ac63ed0923e3bc5533c2f7998d5b62a828173a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/25621281691205eb015383cbac839182b838514f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5794779.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5794779/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2Ozg4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAV","BAF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MxA activity","antiviral activity of MxA","expression of MxA","MxA cofactors","MxA restriction of IAV","induced MxA protein","broad antiviral activity","depleted A549-MxA cells","antiviral state","key antiviral host restriction factor","small set of SMARCA2","regulated factors","Transcriptome analysis of SMARCA2","virus-inducible factors","combined data","additional cellular factors","H5N1 reporter virus","human airway epithelial cells","RNA viruses","crucial factor","human interferon","proteomic screen","IFN-stimulated genes","genome-wide siRNA-based screen","ATPase subunit","BAF chromatin remodeling complex","concert","pathogenic avian influenza","indirect effect","ISGs","particular IFITM2","establishment","IGFBP3","H7N7 subtype","findings","proteins","mechanism"],"language":"en"},

To date, spatial resolution has only rarely been analyzed in computational/biophysical descriptions of virus replication dynamics. However, it is widely acknowledged that intracellular spatial dependence is a crucial component of virus life cycles. The hepatitis C virus-encoded NS5A protein is an endoplasmatic reticulum (ER)-anchored viral protein and an essential component of the virus replication machinery. Therefore, we simulate NS5A dynamics on realistic reconstructed, curved ER surfaces by means of surface partial differential equations (sPDE) upon unstructured grids. We match the in silico NS5A diffusion constant such that the NS5A sPDE simulation data reproduce experimental NS5A fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) time series data. This parameter estimation yields the NS5A diffusion constant. Such parameters are needed for spatial models of HCV dynamics, which we are developing in parallel but remain qualitative at this stage. Thus, our present study likely provides the first quantitative biophysical description of the movement of a viral component.

The World Health Organization (WHO) supports countries in preparing for and responding to public health emergencies, which often require developing new guidance in short timelines with scarce evidence. The objective of this study was to understand frontline physicians\u2019 and nurses\u2019 perspectives about personal protective equipment (PPE) use during the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa and to incorporate these findings into the development process of a WHO rapid advice guideline. Methods : We surveyed frontline physicians and nurses deployed to West Africa between March and September of 2014. Results: We developed the protocol, obtained ethics approval, delivered the survey, analysed the data and presented the findings as part of the evidence-to-decision tables at the expert panel meeting where the recommendations were formulated within eight weeks. Forty-four physicians and nurses responded to the survey. They generally felt at low or extremely low risk of virus transmission with all types of PPE used. Eye protection reduced the ability to provide care, mainly due to impaired visibility because of fogging. Heat and dehydration were a major issue for 76% of the participants using goggles and for 64% using a hood. Both gowns and coveralls were associated with significant heat stress and dehydration. Most participants (59%) were very confident that they were using PPE correctly. Conclusion : Our study demonstrated that it was possible to incorporate primary data on end-users\u2019 preferences into a rapid advice guideline for a public health emergency in difficult field conditions. Health workers perceived a balance between transmission protection and ability to care for patients effectively while wearing PPE.

The nucleoprotein (NP) is conserved among all influenza A viruses (IAVs) and has no cellular equivalent. Therefore, NP is an ideal target for the development of new IAV inhibitors. In this study, we identified a novel anti\u2010influenza compound, ZBMD\u20101, from a library of 20,000 compounds using cell\u2010based influenza A infection assays. We found that ZBMD\u20101 inhibited the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A virus strains in vitro, with an IC (50) ranging from 0.41\u20131.14 \u03BCM. Furthermore, ZBMD\u20101 inhibited the polymerase activity and specifically impaired the nuclear export of NP. Further investigation indicated that ZBMD\u20101 binds to the nuclear export signal 3 (NES3) domain and the dimer interface of the NP pocket. ZBMD\u20101 also protected mice that were challenged with lethal doses of A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) virus, effectively relieving lung histopathology changes, as well as strongly inhibiting the expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, without inducing toxicity effects in mice. These results suggest that ZBMD\u20101 is a promising anti\u2010influenza compound which can be further investigated as a useful strategy against IAVs in the future.","publish_time":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Feng; Chen, Jingliang; Zhang, Junsong; Tan, Likai; Lu, Gui; Luo, Yongjie; Pan, Ting; Liang, Juanran; Li, Qianwen; Luo, Baohong; Zhang, Hui; Lu, Gen","journal":"J Cell Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/693a08804a5da83a38bff8f67201eb50817e557e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5824420.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5824420/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkwMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ZBMD","based influenza","H3N2 influenza","treatment of influenza infection","novel anti\u2010influenza compound","promising anti\u2010influenza compound","nuclear export of NP","NP pocket","new antiviral drugs","IAVs","mice","nuclear export signal","virus strains","infection assays","replication of H1N1","resistant viruses","development of new IAV inhibitors","chemokines","NES3","emergence of drug","urgent requirement","domain","dimer interface","binds","relieving lung histopathology changes","ideal target","expression of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines","compounds","toxicity effects","polymerase activity","useful strategy","future","lethal doses","library","cellular equivalent","study","investigation","nucleoprotein","results","\u03BCM"],"language":"en"},

We applied a convolutional neural network to dermoscopy images of acral melanoma and benign nevi on the hands and feet and evaluated its usefulness for the early diagnosis of these conditions. METHODS: A total of 724 dermoscopy images comprising acral melanoma (350 images from 81 patients) and benign nevi (374 images from 194 patients), and confirmed by histopathological examination, were analyzed in this study. To perform the 2-fold cross validation, we split them into two mutually exclusive subsets: half of the total image dataset was selected for training and the rest for testing, and we calculated the accuracy of diagnosis comparing it with the dermatologist\u2019s and non-expert\u2019s evaluation. RESULTS: The accuracy (percentage of true positive and true negative from all images) of the convolutional neural network was 83.51% and 80.23%, which was higher than the non-expert\u2019s evaluation (67.84%, 62.71%) and close to that of the expert (81.08%, 81.64%).

Here, we reported the case of a woman co-infected by influenza A H7N9 and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, whose treatment process was a little bit longer and a little bit complicated as well. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was an 80-year-old Chinese woman who presented with fever, cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. A computed tomography scan showed obvious infiltrations at lower parts of both lungs. Arterial blood gas analysis confirmed a severe respiratory failure (type I). Her sputum and throat swabs were checked for nucleic acid of influenza A and the result was positive for influenza A H7N9. She was diagnosed as having severe influenza A H7N9 and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and was admitted to an intensive care unit. She was given comprehensive treatment, including oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, immunoglobulin, gastric protection, and noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Her condition improved 4 days later. However, some symptoms exacerbated again 2 days later with ground-glass changes appearing in upper area of right lung and the titer of antibody to Mycoplasma pneumoniae rising from 1:80 to 1:640. She was reasonably considered to be infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well, and azithromycin and moxifloxacin were added to her treatment. Oseltamivir was discontinued because of three consecutive negative results of nucleic acid for influenza A H7N9, but anti-Mycoplasma treatment was continued. Although her symptoms and abnormal changes on computed tomography scan slowly went away, she finally recovered from the mixed infection after a total of 33 days of management. CONCLUSION: In patients with confirmed influenza A H7N9 infection whose condition worsens again, especially with new infiltration or lung ground-glass infiltration, one should suspect infection by other pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae.","publish_time":"2018-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Haili; Wang, Shaohong; Yuan, Tongmei; Liu, Jingtao; Yao, Ling; Pan, Xianguo; Long, Xuemei; Wu, Juncheng; Shen, Feng","journal":"J Med Case Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/19f173644fedca02ff9795142e60544165825213.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5853085.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5853085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMuY3N2OzkzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":2022342,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:00Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"AOKCB8R6NyBh\u002BoomnFrdhw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_3.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mycoplasma pneumoniae","severe influenza","confirmed influenza","H7N9 infection","avian influenza","concurrence of influenza","nucleic acid of influenza","anti-Mycoplasma treatment","treatment process","comprehensive treatment","ground-glass changes","lung ground-glass infiltration","computed tomography scan","oseltamivir","mixed infection","condition","days of management","symptoms","severe respiratory failure","woman co-infected","abnormal changes","new infiltration","CASE PRESENTATION","consecutive negative results of nucleic acid","year-old Chinese woman","upper area of right lung","acute respiratory distress syndrome","gastric protection","obvious infiltrations","fever","methylprednisolone","lower parts","titer of antibody","Arterial blood gas analysis","chest tightness","cough","immunoglobulin","cases of human infections","patients","noninvasive mechanical ventilation","throat swabs","total","shortness of breath","lungs","type","CONCLUSION","azithromycin","pathogens","intensive care unit","sputum","moxifloxacin","China","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

We evaluated supplemental oxygen use among HCT recipients with RSV infection. METHODS: Subjects were grouped according to the presence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) without lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), URTI progressing to LRTI, and LRTI at presentation. LRTI was defined as a positive lower respiratory tract sample with or without radiographic abnormality (defined as proven or probable LRTI, respectively) or a positive upper respiratory tract sample with radiographic abnormality (possible LRTI). Supplemental oxygen\u2013free days were defined as any day while alive after diagnosis of RSV infection during which \u22642 L of supplemental oxygen per minute was received. RESULTS: Among 230 patients, supplemental oxygen use by day 28 after the first diagnosis of RSV infection was lowest in patients presenting with URTI (31 of 197 [16%]). Supplemental oxygen use was lower in patients with possible LRTI (12 of 45 [27%]) than in those with proven/probable LRTI (29 of 42 [69%]). Patients presenting with proven/probable LRTI had a median of 16 fewer supplemental oxygen\u2013free days than those presenting with URTI (P \u003C .0001).

In general, ZIKV infection is a self-limiting disease, however cases of Guillain-Barr\u00E9 syndrome and congenital brain abnormalities in newborn infants have been reported. Diagnosing ZIKV infection remains a challenge, as viral RNA detection is only applicable until a few days after the onset of symptoms. After that, serological tests must be applied, and, as expected, high cross-reactivity between ZIKV and other flavivirus serology is observed. Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is indicated to confirm positive samples for being more specific, however it is laborious intensive and time consuming, representing a major bottleneck for patient diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we developed a high-throughput image-based fluorescent neutralization test for ZIKV infection by serological detection. Using 226 human specimens, we showed that the new test presented higher throughput than traditional PRNT, maintaining the correlation between results. Furthermore, when tested with dengue virus samples, it showed 50.53% less cross reactivity than MAC-ELISA.

However, our understanding of pathogen jumps is primarily based around viruses, despite bacteria accounting for the greatest proportion of zoonoses. Because bacterial pathogens in bats (Order: Chiroptera) can have conservation and human health consequences, studies that examine the ecological and evolutionary drivers of bacterial prevalence and barriers to pathogen sharing are crucially needed. We here studied hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (i.e., hemoplasmas) across a species-rich bat community in Belize over two years. Across 469 bats spanning 33 species, half of individuals and two-thirds of species were hemoplasma positive. Infection prevalence was higher for males and for species with larger body mass and colony sizes. Hemoplasmas displayed high genetic diversity (21 novel genotypes) and strong host specificity. Evolutionary patterns supported co-divergence of bats and bacterial genotypes alongside phylogenetically constrained host shifts. Bat species centrality to the network of shared hemoplasma genotypes was phylogenetically clustered and unrelated to prevalence, further suggesting rare\u2014but detectable\u2014bacterial sharing between species. Our study highlights the importance of using fine phylogenetic scales when assessing host specificity and suggests phylogenetic similarity may play a key role in host shifts for not only viruses but also bacteria. Such work more broadly contributes to increasing efforts to understand cross-species transmission and epidemiological consequences of bacterial pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-03-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Becker, Daniel J.; Speer, Kelly A.; Brown, Alexis M.; Fenton, M.

Background: Extra-pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 has been reported in the hepatic, renal and hematological systems. Most neurological manifestations are non-focal but few have reported the characteristics of ischemic strokes or investigated its pathophysiology. Methods: Over the last 6 weeks, data from four centers in New York City were collected to review the possible ischemic stroke types seen in COVID-19 positive patients. Their presentation, demographics, other related vascular risk factors, associated laboratory and coagulation markers, as well as imaging and outcomes were collected. Results: In our study, age range of patients was 25-75 with no significant male preponderance. 70% presented for acute hospitalization due the stroke. About a fifth did not have common risk factors for ischemic stroke like diabetes and hypertension. None had history of atrial fibrillation or smoking. 50% had poor outcome with four ending in mortality and one in a critical condition due ARDS. All had high Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio except one who demonstrated some neurological recovery. In 70% of our cases, D-dimer levels were collected, and all showed mild to severe elevation. None of the emergent large vessel occlusion (LVO) cases had known cardiac risk factors but two out of five were found to have cardiac abnormalities during the course of their hospitalization. All LVOs had hypercoagulable lab markers especially elevated D-dimer and/or Fibrinogen. The LVO patients were younger and sicker with a median age of 46 and mean NIHSS of 24 as opposed to non-LVOs with a median age of 62 and mean NIHSS of 6 respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 related ischemic events can be small vessel, branch emboli or large vessel occlusions. The latter is often associated with either a hypercoagulable state or cardio-embolism.

The large number of patients requiring intensive care threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems globally. Likewise, there is a compelling need for a COVID-19 disease severity test to prioritize care and resources for patients at elevated risk of mortality. Here, an integrated point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score and clinical decision support system is presented using biomarker measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminus pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), myoglobin (MYO), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The COVID-19 Severity Score combines multiplex biomarker measurements and risk factors in a statistical learning algorithm to predict mortality. The COVID-19 Severity Score was trained and evaluated using data from 160 hospitalized COVID-19 patients from Wuhan, China. Our analysis finds that COVID-19 Severity Scores were significantly higher for the group that died versus the group that was discharged with median (interquartile range) scores of 59 (40-83) and 9 (6-17), respectively, and area under the curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.99). These promising initial models pave the way for a point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score system to impact patient care after further validation with externally collected clinical data.

Little is known about COVID-19 testing rates and COVID-19 test outcomes in people with mental illness. We hypothesized that people with psychiatric disorders are less likely to undergo COVID-19 testing and more likely to test positive. Methods We used data on COVID-19 testing in the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort to compare the prevalence of COVID-19 testing and test outcomes among individuals with psychiatric disorders to those without such diagnoses. We further investigated associations of testing probability and outcome with psychiatric diagnostic categories. Outcomes Individuals with psychiatric disorders were overrepresented among the 1 474 UKB participants with test data: 23% of the COVID-19 test sample had a psychiatric diagnosis compared to 10% in the full cohort (p\u003C0.0001). This overrepresentation persisted for each of the specific psychiatric disorders tested. Furthermore, individuals with a psychiatric disorder (p=0.01), particularly with substance use disorder (p\u003C0.005), had negative test results significantly more often than individuals without psychiatric disorders. Sensitivity analyses confirmed our results. Interpretation In contrast with our hypotheses, UKB participants with psychiatric disorders have been tested for COVID-19 more frequently than individuals without a psychiatric history, pleading against the notion that limited health care access is preventing them from undergoing testing. Among those tested, test outcomes were more frequently negative for UKB participants with psychiatric disorders than in others, countering arguments that people with mental illness are more prone to contract the virus.

The study has thus far included 10 cycles of respirator decontamination, with periodic qualitative and quantitative fit testing to verify ongoing respirator integrity through the decontamination process, and support a statistical evaluation of successful respirator fit. In addition, we have conducted virologic testing of respirator surfaces and materials to demonstrate a rigorous verification of decontamination. Given that the current pandemic entails a respiratory viral pathogen, it is critical to address these aspects of respirator safety for reuse. These measures are intended to provide a foundation for a suitable decontamination process, which maintains N95 function, and supports safe respirator reuse by healthcare providers. Current results from both respirator fit testing and virologic testing indicate that the process is effective on the basis of zero failure rate on fit-testing of selected respirators, and on complete decontamination of multiple virus species by aHP treatment, comparable to that observed with commercial spore-based biological indicators of sterilization.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Derr, T.

We review here the fundamental role payed by both the topology of the underlying surface and its detailed curvature. Topology dictates certain broad features of the defect structure of the ground state but curvature-driven energetics controls the detailed structured of ordered phases. Among the surprises are the appearance in the ground state of structures that would normally be thermal excitations and thus prohibited at zero temperature. Examples include excess dislocations in the form of grain boundary scars for spherical crystals above a minimal system size, dislocation unbinding for toroidal hexatics, interstitial fractionalization in spherical crystals and the appearance of well-separated disclinations for toroidal crystals. Much of the analysis leads to universal predictions that do not depend on the details of the microscopic interactions that lead to order in the first place. These predictions are subject to test by the many experimental soft and hard matter systems that lead to curved ordered structures such as colloidal particles self-assembling on droplets of one liquid in a second liquid. The defects themselves may be functionalized to create ligands with directional bonding. Thus nano to meso scale superatoms may be designed with specific valency for use in building supermolecules and novel bulk materials. Parameters such as particle number, geometrical aspect ratios and anisotropy of elastic moduli permit the tuning of the precise architecture of the superatoms and associated supermolecules. Thus the field has tremendous potential from both a fundamental and materials science/supramolecular chemistry viewpoint.","publish_time":"2008-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bowick, Mark J.; Giomi, Luca","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8e72c04f5585dc7a4fbfb66c215a116087087b9d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.3064v2.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs1ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spherical crystals","toroidal crystals","ground state of structures","curved ordered structures","detailed curvature","topology","liquid","detailed structured of ordered phases","toroidal hexatics","building supermolecules","materials science","associated supermolecules","universal predictions","curvature-driven energetics","hard matter systems","novel bulk materials","meso scale superatoms","fundamental role payed","appearance of well-separated disclinations","geometrical aspect ratios","colloidal particles self-assembling","form of grain boundary scars","defect structure","anisotropy of elastic moduli","minimal system size","use","interstitial fractionalization","particle number","specific valency","arrangements of units","tuning","synthetic world","certain broad features","droplets","precise architecture","supramolecular chemistry viewpoint","excess dislocations","test","underlying surface","tremendous potential","microscopic interactions","two-dimensional surfaces","Examples","Parameters","nano","nature","thermal excitations","ligands","directional bonding","details","field","analysis","surprises","place","temperature"],"language":"en"},

Willingness of persons experiencing symptoms to seek testing may determine the success of this strategy. Methods: A cross-sectional, online survey in the United States measured willingness to seek testing if feeling ill under different specimen collection scenarios: home-based saliva, home-based swab, drive-through facility swab, and clinic-based swab. Instructions clarified that home-collected specimens would be mailed to a laboratory for testing. We presented similar willingness questions regarding testing during follow-up care. Results: Of 1435 participants, comprising a broad range of sociodemographic groups, 92% were willing to test with a home saliva specimen, 88% with home swab, 71% with drive-through swab, and 60% with clinic collected swab. Moreover, 68% indicated they would be more likely to get tested if there was a home testing option. There were no significant differences in willingness items across sociodemographic variables or for those currently experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Results were nearly identical for willingness to receive testing for follow-up COVID-19 care. Conclusions: We observed a hierarchy of willingness to test for SARS-CoV-2, ordered by the degree of contact required. Home specimen collection options could result in up to one-third more symptomatic persons seeking testing, facilitating contact tracing and optimal clinical care. Remote specimen collection options may ease supply chain challenges and decrease the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. As home specimen collection options receive regulatory approval, they should be scaled rapidly by health systems.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siegler, A.

Estimating the infection fatality rate (IFR) has been elusive due to the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections and lack of testing capacity. We analyze global data to derive the IFR of COVID-19. Estimates of COVID-19 IFR in each country or locality differ due to variable sampling regimes, demographics, and healthcare resources. We present a novel statistical approach based on sampling effort and the reported case fatality rate of each country. The asymptote of this function gives the global IFR. Applying this asymptotic estimator to cumulative COVID-19 data from 139 countries reveals a global IFR of 1.04% (CI: 0.77%,1.38%). Deviation of countries\u0027 reported CFR from the estimator does not correlate with demography or per capita GDP, suggesting variation is due to differing testing regimes or reporting guidelines by country. Estimates of IFR through seroprevalence studies and point estimates from case studies or sub-sampled populations are limited by sample coverage and cannot inform a global IFR, as mortality is known to vary dramatically by age and treatment availability. Our estimated IFR aligns with many previous estimates and is the first attempt at a global estimate of COVID-19 IFR.","publish_time":"2020-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grewelle, R.; De Leo, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aa2b335f82281100d08bf3dd47469fe92d4e8b15.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.11.20098780v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["global IFR","IFR of COVID","Estimates of IFR","estimated IFR","Estimates of COVID","global data","global estimate of COVID","global pandemic","country","cumulative COVID","previous estimates","case studies","reported case fatality rate","variable sampling regimes","differing testing regimes","infection fatality rate","sampling effort","seroprevalence studies","asymptotic estimator","lack of testing capacity","Deviation of countries\u0027 reported CFR","sub-sampled populations","symptomatic infections","variation","demographics","sample coverage","locality","attempt","presence of asymptomatic","novel statistical approach","guidelines","healthcare resources","demography","function","treatment availability","GDP","asymptote","mortality","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually.","publish_time":"2020-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kucharski, Adam J; Russell, Timothy W; Diamond, Charlie; Liu, Yang; Edmunds, John; Funk, Sebastian; Eggo, Rosalind M","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a44334e676e43c1889d282b0f0a8365f0f1e0c52.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019901","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["sustained transmission","chains of transmission","similar transmission potential","introduced cases","international cases","early transmission dynamics","confirmed cases","stochastic transmission model","Wuhan pre-control","cases of novel coronavirus disease","international locations","COVID","effectiveness of control measures","introduction of control measures","infection","new areas","estimates of Rt","new outbreaks","week","CI","novel coronavirus SARS-CoV","data","median daily reproduction number","results","probability","travel restrictions","Interpretation","Background","Methods","Findings","population","time"],"language":"en"},

Using a smooth generalized additive model with quasipoisson counts for total infections and deaths, we developed a county-level predictive model that included population demographics, social characteristics, social distancing, and testing data. This model strongly predicted the actual US distribution of Covid-19, accounting for 94.8% of spatial-temporal variation in total infections and 99.3% in Covid-19 related fatalities from March 15, 2020. US counties with higher population density, poverty index, civilian population, and minorities, especially African Americans had a higher number of confirmed infections adjusted for county population. Social distancing measured by the change in the rate of human encounter per km2 relative to pre-covid-19 national average was associated with slower rate of Covid-19 infections, whereas higher testing was associated with higher number of infections. The number of people infected was increasing, however, the rate of increase in new infections was starting to show signs of plateauing starting from the second week of April. Our model projects 2.11 million people to test positive for Covid-19 and 122,951 fatalities by June 1, 2020. Importantly, our model suggests strong social differences in the infections and deaths across US communities, and inequities in areas with larger African American minorities and higher poverty index expected to show higher rates of Covid-19 infections and deaths. Preventive steps including social distancing and community closures have been a cornerstone in stopping the transmission and potentially reducing the spread of the disease. Crucial knowledge of the role of social characteristics in the disease transmission is essential to understand current disease distribution, predict future distribution, and plan additional preventive steps.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rajan, K.; Dhana, K.; Barnes, L.

Methods Administrative support with the aim of zero nosocomial transmission by reducing elective clinical services, decanting wards, mobilizing isolation facilities, providing adequate personal protective equipment, coordinating laboratory network for rapid molecular diagnosis under 4-tier active surveillance for hospitalized- and out-patients, and organizing staff forum and training was implemented under the framework of preparedness plan in Hospital Authority. The trend of SARS-CoV-2 in the first 72 days was compared with that of SARS-CoV 2003. Results Up to day 72 of the epidemic, 130 (0.40%) of 32,443 patients being screened confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Compared with SARS outbreak in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 case load constituted 8.9% (130 SARS-CoV-2/1458 SARS-CoV) of SARS-CoV infected cases at day 72 of the outbreak. The incidences of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV per-1,000-SARS-patient-day and per-100-SARS-patient-admission were 7.9 and 16.9 respectively, which were significantly higher than the corresponding incidences of SARS-CoV-2 (zero infection, p\u003C0.001).

Viral entry requires binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2). In an earlier paper1, we report on the specific residue interactions underpinning this event. Here we report on the de novo computational design of high affinity antibody variable regions through the recombination of VDJ genes targeting the most solvent-exposed hACE2-binding residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the software tool OptMAVEn-2.02. Subsequently, we carry out computational affinity maturation of the designed prototype variable regions through point mutations for improved binding with the target epitope. Immunogenicity was restricted by preferring designs that match sequences from a 9-mer library of \u201Chuman antibodies\u201D based on H-score (human string content, HSC)3. We generated 106 different designs and report in detail on the top five that trade-off the greatest affinity for the spike RBD epitope (quantified using the Rosetta binding energies) with low H-scores. By grafting the designed Heavy (VH) and Light (VL) chain variable regions onto a human framework (Fc), high-affinity and potentially neutralizing full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can be constructed.

In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with clinically significant lower level of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), which can be used as indicators of disease severity and poor prognosis. Importantly, we found the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2-S) bound to HDL. Antagonists of HDL receptor-Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-B1), strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the lipids transfer function of SR-B1 was indispensable for this inhibition, offering explanations for the reduced serum HDL level observed in COVID-19 patients. Basing on findings here, we speculate that SR-B1-mediated pulmonary HDL-vitamin E uptake could participate in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells, and the unique expression profile of SR-B1 may also affect SARS-CoV-2 cell and tissue tropism. These findings might help to provide further insights into viral transmission, pathological characteristics and reveal therapeutic targets.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wei, Congwen; Wan, Luming; Zhang, Yanhong; Fan, Chen; Yan, Qiulin; Yang, Xiaoli; Gong, Jing; Yang, Huan; Li, Huilong; Zhang, Jun; Zhang, Zhe; Wang, Rong; Wang, Xiaolin; Sun, Jin; Zong, Yulong; Yin, Feng; Zhang, Rui; Gao, Qi; Cao, Yuan; Zhong, Hui","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.16.20068528v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["mediating SARS-CoV","inhibited SARS-CoV","SR-B1","HDL-C","pathogenic SARS-coronavirus","spike protein of SARS","reduced serum HDL level","function of SR","significant lower level of HDL cholesterol","pulmonary HDL-vitamin E uptake","Antagonists of HDL receptor-Scavenger receptor class B type","findings","unique expression profile of SR","infection of lung cells","pathological characteristics","explanations","insights","COVID","viral transmission","indicators of disease severity","poor prognosis","inhibition","therapeutic targets","tissue tropism","lipids","patients","global pandemic","study"],"language":"en"},

Objective: To assess the characteristics of articles published during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare it with articles published during 2009 H1N1 swine influenza pandemic. Data sources: Articles on COVID-19 and on H1N1 swine influenza indexed in PubMed (Medline) during the first 3 months of these pandemics. Study selection: Any article published in the respective study periods that included any terminology related to COVID-19 or H1N1 in the title, abstract or full-text was eligible for inclusion. Articles that did not present an English abstract, as well as correspondence to previous research and erratum were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two operators conducted the selection of articles and data extraction procedures independently. The article is reported following STROBE guidelines for observational studies. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of primary and secondary articles. Prevalence of reporting of limitations in the abstracts. Results: Of the 2482 articles retrieved, 1165 were included. Approximately half of them were secondary articles (575, 49.4%). Common primary articles were: human medical research (340, 59.1%), in silico studies (182, 31.7%) and in vitro studies (26, 4.5%). Of the human medical research, the vast majority were observational studies and cases series, followed by single case reports and one randomized controlled trial. Secondary articles were mainly reviews, viewpoints and editorials (373, 63.2%). The second largest category was guidelines or guidance articles, including 193 articles (32.7%), of which 169 were indications for specific departments, patients or procedures. Limitations were reported in 42 out of 1165 abstracts (3.6%), with 10 abstracts reporting actual methodological limitations. In a similar timeframe in 2009 there were 223 articles published on the H1N1 pandemic. As compared to that pandemic, during COVID-19 there were higher chances to publish reviews and guidance articles and lower chances to publish in vitro and animal research studies. Conclusions and Relevance: As compared to the most recent pandemic, there is an overwhelming amount of information published on COVID-19. However, the majority of the articles published do not add significant information, possibly diluting the original information published. Also, only a negligible number of published articles reports limitations in the abstracts, hindering a rapid interpretation of their shortcomings.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Girolamo, Nicola; Meursinge Reynders, Reint","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43fd805c690c66882611576bed49bc8103066413.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20073130v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs3OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Data Extraction"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["secondary articles","guidance articles","selection of articles","characteristics of articles","published scientific articles","negligible number of published articles","Common primary articles","COVID","H1N1 pandemic","abstracts","observational studies","H1N1 swine influenza pandemic","recent pandemic","animal research studies","silico studies","human medical research","previous research","data extraction procedures","Prevalence of primary","Study selection","Data sources","reviews","actual methodological limitations","original information","significant information","Prevalence of reporting","months","vast majority","lower chances","higher chances","English abstract","single case reports","following STROBE guidelines","respective study periods","cases series","correspondence","Measures","operators","randomized controlled trial","text","specific departments","patients","Medline","terminology","Synthesis","PubMed","largest category","Main Outcomes","indications","rapid interpretation","erratum","title","viewpoints","shortcomings","inclusion","half","Importance","similar timeframe","Conclusions","Relevance","Objective","editorials","pandemics","Results"],"language":"en"},

Statistically significant (P \u003C .05) covariates in the univariable model were together entered into the multivariable model. A slope (coefficient) of the univariable meta-regression line for COVID-19 prevalence was not significant for household income (P = .639), whereas the coefficient was significantly positive for black (coefficient, 0.021; P = .015), Hispanic/Latino (0.033; P \u003C .001), and poverty (0.039; P = .02), which indicated that COVID-19 prevalence increased significantly as black, Hispanic/Latino, and poverty increased.

Here, we used EMG data gathered during mouse locomotion to investigate the effects of calculation parameters and data quality on two metrics for fractal analysis: the Higuchi\u2019s fractal dimension (HFD) and the Hurst exponent (H). A curve is fractal if it repeats itself at every scale or, in other words, if its shape remains unchanged when zooming in the curve at every zoom level. Many linear and nonlinear analysis methods are available, each of them aiming at the explanation of different data features. In recent years, fractal analysis has become a powerful nonlinear tool to extract information from physiological data not visible to the naked eye. It can present, however, some dangerous pitfalls that can lead to misleading interpretations. To calculate the HFD and the H, we have extracted muscle synergies from normal and mechanically perturbed treadmill locomotion from the hindlimb of adult mice. Then, we used one set per condition (normal and perturbed walking) of the obtained time-dependent coefficients to create surrogate data with different fluctuations over the original mean signal. Our analysis shows that HFD and H are exceptionally sensitive to the presence or absence of perturbations to locomotion. However, both metrics suffer from variations in their value depending on the parameters used for calculations and the presence of quasi-periodic elements in the time series. We discuss those issues giving some simple suggestions to reduce the chance of misinterpreting the outcomes. New \u0026 Noteworthy Despite the lack of consensus on how to perform fractal analysis of physiological time series, many studies rely on this technique. Here, we shed light on the potential pitfalls of using the Higuchi\u2019s fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent. We expose and suggest how to solve the drawbacks of such methods when applied to data from normal and perturbed locomotion by combining in vivo recordings and computational approaches.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Santuz, Alessandro; Akay, Turgay","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bdbda48ae016010a98e8d812f5e5f5a564b429d6.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.059618","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hurst"],"organizations":["EMG","HFD","New \u0026 Noteworthy"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EMG data","data quality","surrogate data","Time-dependent physiological data","fractal analysis of physiological time series","perturbed locomotion","Higuchi\u2019s fractal dimension","nonlinear analysis methods","HFD","explanation of different data features","perturbed treadmill locomotion","mouse locomotion","perturbed walking","obtained time-dependent coefficients","recordings","metrics","Hurst exponent","curve","different fluctuations","potential pitfalls","dangerous pitfalls","powerful nonlinear tool","effects of calculation parameters","presence of quasi-periodic elements","information","electromyogram","multiple muscles","muscle synergies","original mean signal","calculations","hindlimb of adult mice","condition","studies","lack of consensus","absence of perturbations","naked eye","words","chance","simple suggestions","value","set","recent years","misleading interpretations","computational approaches","issues","shape","zoom level","variations","light","scale","outcomes","technique","drawbacks"],"language":"en"},

ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic has affected countries on all continents where containment and isolation measures have been systematically applied. Aim: To synthesize the available evidence on the management of home isolation due to COVID-19 infection. Method: A scoping review has been carried out using the Trip Database, PUBMED, CINAHL, COCHRANE and Scopus controlled language without any limits. From all the documents located, information was extracted on the date of publication, country of publication, type of study, assessment of the level of evidence and degree of recommendation, and results of interest to answer the research question. Critical reading of the selected documents has been carried out, but without using it as an exclusion criterion but rather informative. Results: 163 records were located and 14 were selected. The recommendations have been grouped into 10 topics around all the daily management of home care. Conclusions: The scarcity of robust evidence on isolation from COVID-19 infection is objective. Most of the documents are reviews carried out after the consensus of experts at the international level.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abad-Corpa, Eva; S\u00E1nchez-L\u00F3pez, Dolores; Moreno-Casbas, Mar\u00EDa Teresa","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5cc7db823e6cb67a77964e82b733da61a3b6e76.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S113086212030303X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S113086212030303X?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sintetizar","Resultados"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Se localizaron","Se objetiva","pandemia COVID","registros y se han seleccionado","Se ha realizado lectura cr\u00EDtica","todos los continentes donde se ha aplicado","confinamiento y aislamiento","todos los documentos localizados se extrajo informaci\u00F3n sobre","los documentos seleccionados","evidencia y grado","recomendaci\u00F3n y resultados","ha afectado","Las recomendaciones se han agrupado en","level of evidence","selected documents","management of home isolation","Se ha realizado una scoping review consultando mediante lenguaje controlado Trip Database","COCHRANE y Elsevier sin ning\u00FAn tipo","CINAHL","evidencia disponible sobre","PUBMED","publicaci\u00F3n","available evidence","isolation measures","infection","results","los documentos son revisiones realizadas tras","aislamiento domiciliario por infecci\u00F3n","evidencias robustas sobre","scarcity of robust evidence","manejo cotidiano","country of publication","date of publication","nivel internacional","daily management of home care","international level","cuidado en domicilio","pero sin utilizarla como criterio","forma sistem\u00E1tica medidas","temas alrededor","consenso","fecha","pa\u00EDses","inter\u00E9s para responder","escasez","valoraci\u00F3n","exclusi\u00F3n sino informativo","expertos","estudio","Scopus controlled language","continents","type of study","assessment","mayor\u00EDa","Sintetizar","l\u00EDmites","M\u00E9todo","pregunta","containment","countries","Objetivo","degree of recommendation","consensus of experts","limits","investigaci\u00F3n","topics","Conclusions","pandemic","Critical reading","Conclusiones","RESUMEN","exclusion criterion","reviews","information","Method","research question","recommendations","records"],"language":"en"},

Comparison of genome sequences from diverse locations allows us to identify the genetic diversity among viruses which would help in ascertaining viral virulence, disease pathogenicity, origin and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 between countries. The aim of this study is to ascertain the genetic diversity among Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Initial examination of the phylogenetic data of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n=3123) from different continents deposited at GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) revealed multiple origin for Indian isolates. An in-depth analysis of 449 viral genomes derived from samples representing countries from USA, Europe, China, East Asia, South Asia, Oceania, Middle East regions and India revealed that most Indian samples are divided into two clusters (A and B) with cluster A showing more similarity to samples from Oceania and Kuwait and the cluster B grouping with countries from Europe, Middle East and South Asia. Diversity analysis of viral clades, which are characterized by specific non-synonymous mutations in viral proteins, discovered that the cluster A Indian samples belong to I clade (V378I in ORF1ab), which is an Oceania clade with samples having Iran connections and the cluster B Indian samples belong to G clade (D614G in Spike protein), which is an European clade. Thus our study identifies that the Indian SARS-CoV-2 viruses belong to I and G clades with potential origin to be countries mainly from Oceania, Europe, Middle East and South Asia regions, which strongly implying the spread of virus through most travelled countries. The study also emphasizes the importance of pathogen genomics through phylogenetic analysis to discover viral genetic diversity and understand the viral transmission dynamics with eventual grasp on viral virulence and disease pathogenesis.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Somasundaram, K.; Mondal, M.; Lawarde, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc9c7c7ede546a58f9ebd1bf7ec8c1148c62fa34.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.25.20079475v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs4Mzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Influenza Data"],"locations":["India","China","East Asia","Kuwait","Iran","Europe","Oceania","Middle East","South Asia"],"keyphrases":["cluster B Indian samples","viral genetic diversity","Indian SARS-CoV","viral virulence","viral genomes","East Asia","viral proteins","Diversity analysis of viral clades","Oceania clade","Indian isolates","viral transmission dynamics","Middle East regions","South Asia regions","travelled countries","study","phylogenetic data of SARS","phylogenetic analysis","European clade","G clades","multiple origin","potential origin","in-depth analysis","viruses","disease pathogenesis","disease pathogenicity","pandemic disease","Influenza Data","spread of virus","eventual grasp","Iran connections","China","Global Initiative","specific non-synonymous mutations","importance of pathogen genomics","D614G","Kuwait","USA","different continents","diverse locations","Spike protein","Comparison of genome sequences","GISAID","COVID","similarity","Initial examination","ORF1ab","V378I","clusters","World Health Organization","aim"],"language":"en"},

We received a request from National Health Systems Resource Centre, a public agency in India, for a Rapid Evidence Synthesis (RES) on community health workers (CHWs) for COVID-19 prevention and control. Methods: We searched PubMed, websites of ministries, public agencies, multilateral institutions, COVID-19 resource aggregators and pre-prints (without language restrictions) for articles on the role, challenges and enablers for CHWs in pandemics. Two reviewers screened the records independently with a third reviewer resolving disagreements. One reviewer extracted data in a consensus data extraction form with another reviewer cross-checking it. A framework on CHW performance in primary healthcare not specific to pandemic was used to guide data extraction and narrative analysis. Results: We retrieved 211 records and finally included 36 articles on the role, challenges and enablers for CHWs in pandemics. We found that CHWs play an important role in building awareness, countering stigma and maintaining essential primary healthcare service delivery. It is essential that CHWs are provided adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and appropriately trained in its usage in the early stages of the pandemic. Wide range of policies and guidance is required to ensure health systems functioning. A clear guidance for prioritizing essential activities, postponing non-essential ones and additional pandemic related activities is crucial. CHWs experience stigmatization, isolation and social exclusion. Psychosocial support, non-performance-based incentives, additional transport allowance, accommodation, child-support, awards and recognition programs have been used in previous pandemics. We also created inventories of resources with guiding notes for quick utility by decision makers on guidelines for health workers (n=24), self-isolation in the community (n=10) and information, education and counselling materials on COVID-19 (n=16). Conclusions: CHWs play a critical role in pandemics like COVID-19. It is important to ensure role clarity, training, supportive supervision, as well as their work satisfaction, health and well-being.

A demand modelling simulation case study for carotid endarterectomy","doi":"10.1101/2020.04.29.20085183","pmcid":null,"pubmed_id":null,"license":"medrxiv","abstract":"Background The COVID-19 pandemic presents unparalleled challenges for the delivery of safe and effective care. In response, many health systems have chosen to restrict access to surgery and reallocate resources; the impact on the provision of surgical services has been profound, with huge numbers of patient now awaiting surgery at the risk of avoidable harm. The challenge now is how do hospitals transition from the current pandemic mode of operation back to business as usual, and ensure that all patients receive equitable, timely and high-quality surgical care during all phases of the public health crisis. Aims and Methods This case study takes carotid endarterectomy as a time-sensitive surgical procedure and simulates 400 compartmental demand modelling scenarios for managing surgical capacity in the UK for two years following the pandemic. Results A total of 7,69 patients will require carotid endarterectomy. In the worst-case scenario, if no additional capacity is provided on resumption of normal service, the waiting list may never be cleared, and no patient will receive surgery within the 2-week target; potentially leading to \u003E1000 avoidable strokes. If surgical capacity is doubled after 1-month of resuming normal service, it will still take more than 6-months to clear the backlog, and 30.8% of patients will not undergo surgery within 2-weeks, with an average wait of 20.3 days for the proceeding 2 years. Conclusions This case study for carotid endarterectomy has shown that every healthcare system is going to have to make difficult decisions for balancing human and capital resources against the needs of patients. It has demonstrated that the timing and size of this effort will critically influence the ability of these systems to return to their baseline and continue to provide the highest quality care for all. The failure to sustainably increase surgical capacity early in the post-COVID-19 period will have significant long-term negative impacts on patients and is likely to result in avoidable harm.","publish_time":"2020-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, G.; Clarke, J.; Markar, S.; Carter, A.

Among coronaviruses, the main protease (Mpro) is an essential drug target which, along with papain-like proteases catalyzes the processing of polyproteins translated from viral RNA and recognizes specific cleavage sites. There are no human proteases with similar cleavage specificity and therefore, inhibitors are highly likely to be nontoxic. Therefore, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme with small molecules can block viral replication. The present study is aimed at the identification of promising lead molecules for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme through virtual screening of antiviral compounds from plants. The binding affinity of selected small drug-like molecules to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro were studied using molecular docking. Bonducellpin D was identified as the best lead molecule which shows higher binding affinity (\u22129.28 kcal/mol) as compared to the control (\u22128.24 kcal/mol). The molecular binding was stabilized through four hydrogen bonds with Glu166 and Thr190 as well as hydrophobic interactions via eight residues. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shows identities of 96.08% and 50.65% to that of SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro respectively at the sequence level. At the structural level, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro was found to be 0.517 \u00C5 and 0.817 \u00C5 between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro. Bonducellpin D exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition potential against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro and therefore is a promising drug candidate, which needs further validations through in vitro and in vivo studies.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gurung, Arun Bahadur; Ali, Mohammad Ajmal; Lee, Joongku; Farah, Mohammad Abul; Al-Anazi, Khalid Mashay","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b4c3e4a3a3c9c8712db2a3b46c12a89412ebe16.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520305816; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520305816?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMwLmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1926297,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"gqS87ZtRchgc1TmDqZcDew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_30.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bonducellpin"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV Mpro","MERS-CoV Mpro","Mpro enzyme","new SARS coronavirus","small molecules","molecular binding","binding affinity of selected small drug","identification of promising lead molecules","higher binding affinity","promising drug candidate","kcal","essential drug target","viral RNA","viral replication","human proteases","structural level","sequence level","molecular docking","Bonducellpin D exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition potential","best lead molecule","similar cleavage specificity","specific cleavage sites","virtual screening of antiviral compounds","square deviation","Thr190","inhibitors","root","RMSD","processing of polyproteins","hydrogen bonds","Glu166","plants","papain","hydrophobic interactions","main protease","pandemic","validations","control","coronaviruses","genus Betacoronavirus","residues","present study","identities","COVID","studies"],"language":"en"},

Since we observed clinical and histopathological similarities between COVID-19 and lung manifestations of connective tissue disease (CTD-ILD) in our clinical practice, aim of the present study is to analyze a possible role of autoimmunity in SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure. Methods: In this prospective, single-center trial, we enrolled 22 consecutive patients with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized in March and April, 2020. We performed high-resolution computed tomography (HR-CT) and full laboratory testing including autoantibody (AAB) screening (anti-ANA, SS-B/La, Scl-70, Jo-1, CENP-B, PM-Scl). Transbronchial biopsies as well as post mortem tissue samples were obtained from 3 and 2 cases, respectively, and subsequent histopathologic analysis with special emphasis on characterization of interstitial lung disease was performed. Results: Twelve of 22 patients (54.5%) were male and median age was 69.0 (range: 28-88). 11 (50.0%) patients had to be undergo intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Intubation with ventilation was required in 10/22 cases (46%). Median follow-up was 26 days. Clinical and serological parameters were comparable to previous reports. Radiological and histopathological findings were highly heterogeneous including patterns reminiscent of CTD-ILD. AAB titers [\u2265]1:100 were detected in 10/11 (91.9%) COVID-19 patients who required ICU treatment, but in 4/11 (36.4%) patients with mild clinical course (p=0.024). Patients with AABs tended to require invasive ventilation and showed significantly more severe complications (64.3% vs. 12.5%, p=0.031). Overall COVID-19-related mortality was 18.2% among hospitalized patients at our institution. Conclusion: Our findings point out serological, radiological and histomorphological similarities between COVID-19-associated ARDS and acute exacerbation of CTD-ILD. While the exact mechanism is still unknown, we postulate that SARS-CoV-2 infection might trigger or simulate a form of organ-specific autoimmunity in predisposed patients. The detection of autoantibodies might identify patients who profit from immunosuppressive therapy to prevent the development of respiratory failure.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gagiannis, D.; Steinestel, J.; Hackenbroch, C.; Hannemann, M.; Umathum, V.

Mosaicism for X chromosome monosomy (XCM) shows a similar increase in aging population mostly driven by loss of chromosome Y in males (LOY), and is associated with a raise in all-cause mortality. Using comparative transcriptomic data, we have defined that XCM/LOY is associated with abnormal peripheral blood cell counts with decreased progenitor cells and multiple biomarkers of immune system dysfunction, pro-coagulation activity and increased cardiovascular risk. Several differentially down-regulated genes in XCM/LOY individuals are involved in the initial immune response to SARS-CoV-2 (OR of enrichment=7.23, p=1.5x10-7), mainly interferon-induced genes that code for inhibitors of viral processes. Thus, our data suggest that XCM mosaicism underlies at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging patients. Given its potential relevance for modulating prognosis and therapeutic response, we propose that evaluation of LOY and XCM by currently established methods should be implemented as biomarkers in infected patients, including currently ongoing clinical trials with different medications and vaccines for COVID-19. Testing for LOY/XCM at large scale among elderly people may also be helpful to identify still unexposed people who may be especially vulnerable to severe Covid-19 disease.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Perez-Jurado, L.

Data sources: A systematic review of literature from December 2019 to 6th May 2020 was conducted on Pubmed, google scholar, ovid, scopus and ISI web of science. Study eligibility criteria: Studies which investigated urinary viral shedding of COVID-19 in infected patients included. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Two reviewers selected relative studies and performed quality assessment of individual studies. Meta-analysis was performed the pooled case reports and case series. Fixed-effects model was used for analysis as no significant heterogeneity was observed between studies. Results: Thirty three studies were finally included in the systematic review including 19 case reports, 13 case series, and one cohort. Urinary samples from 430 patients were investigated. Ten studies reported the presence of COVID-19 in urinary samples from 16 patients. The rate of COVID-19 presence in urinary samples was 3.7%. Urinary viral load was low in most reports. The presence of virus in urine was not related to the disease course of the illness. Urinary COVID-19 was mostly detected from patients with moderate to severe disease (13 pts) but was also isolated from two children (one neonate and one 7 year-old girl) with mild disease. The pathogenicity of virus isolated from urine has been demonstrated in cell culture media in one study. Conclusions: This review highlights the low frequency of COVID-19 presence in urine of infected individuals and the potential of isolated virus for cytopathic effects.

Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific medication. The purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring. Methods Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed. Results A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Tao; Zhang, Jieying; Yang, Yuhui; Ma, Hong; Li, Zhengyu; Zhang, Jiaoyue; Cheng, Ji; Zhang, Xiaoyun; Zhao, Yanxia; Xia, Zihan; Zhang, Liling; Wu, Gang; Yi, Jianhua","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029769","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":["Wuhan City","China"],"keyphrases":["severe type COVID","baseline level of IL","increase of IL","increase of baseline IL","elevated IL","decrease of IL","clinical manifestation of severe type patients","peripheral blood of severe COVID","disease monitoring","nonsevere disease","severity of COVID","disease exacerbation","disease progression","dynamic change of IL","median age of severe cases","increase of baseline level of CRP","Methods Clinical data of patients","outbreak of coronavirus disease","baseline interleukin","LDH","ferritin","admission","Baseline immunological parameters","Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase","common symptoms","CT findings","D-dimer","treatment effectiveness","common comorbidity","peripheral blood cells","improved CT assessment","inflammatory parameters","significant decrease","mild symptoms","interstitial abnormalities","cytokines","chest computed tomography","imaging","proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement","C-reactive protein","hospitalization","changes of markers","year old","maximal body temperature","relationship","transfer","laboratory test","intensive care unit","fever","outcome","Wuhan City","Background","obvious lymphocytopenia","Conclusions","value","total","female patient","normal range","shortness of breath","study","cough","China","institution","hypertension","specific medication","fatigue","purpose","Diarrhea"],"language":"en"},

This epidemiological \u0027curve\u0027 refers to the cases versus time graph, which shows the rise of a disease to its peak before descending. The aim in a pandemic is to flatten this curve by reducing the peak and spreading out the timeline. However, the models used to predict this curve are often not clearly outlined, no model parameters are given, and models are not tested against real data. This lack of detail makes it difficult to recreate the curve. What is much needed is a simple tool for approximating the curve to allow ideas to be tested and comparisons made. Methods This work presents a Simple Curve Approximation Tool (SCAT) which can be used by anyone. This tool allows the user to approximate and draw the curve and allows testing of assumptions, trajectories and the wildly varying figures reported in the media. The mathematics behind SCAT is clearly outlined here but understanding of this is not required. SCAT is provided online as a downloadable MS Excel workbook with some sample cases shown. Throughout this work, the parameters used are specified so that all results can be easily reproduced. Findings Although not intended as a prediction tool, SCAT has achieved less than 0.5 % error in short-term forward prediction. It also shows a very significant improvement on the pandemic exponential approximations found throughout media reporting. As a comparison tool, it highlights obvious differences between COVID-19 and other diseases, such as influenza, and between countries at different stages of the pandemic (China, Italy and the UK are used here for demonstration purposes).

However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged \u003E60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p\u003C0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients. Elevated CRP levels, underlying comorbidities, and NCP severity are the main risk factors for cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients.","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Huayan; Hou, Keke; Xu, Hong; Li, Zhenlin; Chen, Huizhu; Zhang, Na; Xu, Rong; Fu, Hang; Sun, Ran; Wen, Lingyi; Xie, Linjun; Liu, Hui; Zhang, Kun; Selvanayagam, Joseph B; Fu, Chuan; Zhao, Shihua; Yang, Zhigang; Yang, Ming; Guo, Yingkun","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/114ed64f52f503d9d2e2ba1fd1ee62b0a168cd84.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031591","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AMI","NCP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AMI patients","hospitalized COVID","clinical characteristics of COVID","Cardiac complications","non-definite AMI","NCP severity","underlying comorbidities","cardiac abnormalities","cardiac injury biomarkers","Coronavirus Disease","main risk factors","clinical features","Elevated CRP levels","clinical outcomes","years","acute myocardial injury","elevated myocardial enzymes","demographic characteristics","consecutive laboratory","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","management methods","electrocardiography abnormities","routine laboratory tests","intensive care unit","Novel coronavirus pneumonia","cardiovascular diseases","diabetes","echocardiography","C-reactive protein","imaging findings","hypertension","fatal comorbidity","China","Multivariate analyses","information","respiratory manifestations","data","outbreak","women","Conclusions","diastolic dysfunction","Results","tachycardia","Background"],"language":"en"},

The development of severe disease and mortality is higher in older individuals, males and those with other co-morbidities, and may vary across ethnic groups. However, so far, no host genetic factor has been clearly associated with susceptibility and development of severe disease. To understand the impact of host genetics on expression of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) during RNA virus infection we performed a GWAS for ACE2 expression in HCV-infected liver tissue from 195 individuals. We discovered that polymorphisms in the host IFNL region which control expression of IFNL3 and IFNL4 modulate ACE2 expression. ACE2 expression was regulated additionally by age, with a subsidiary effect of co-morbidity. The IFNL locus controlled expression of a gene network incorporating many well-known interferon-stimulated genes which anti-correlated with ACE2 transcript levels. The same anti-correlation was found in the gastrointestinal tract, a site of SARS-CoV-2 replication where inflammation driven interferon-stimulated genes are negatively correlated with ACE2 expression. The interferon dependent regulation of ACE2 was identified in a murine model of SARS-CoV-1 suggesting conserved regulation of ACE2 across species.

PLP2 acts as a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p\u003C0.05) in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis. Coronaviruses employ a genetic economy by encoding multifunctional proteins that function in viral replication and also modify the host environment to disarm the innate immune response. The coronavirus papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain possesses protease activity, which cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and also DUB activity (de-conjugating ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like molecules from modified substrates) using identical catalytic residues. To separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease activity. We engineered a recombinant murine coronavirus to express the DUB mutant and showed that the DUB mutant virus activated an earlier type I interferon response in macrophages and exhibited reduced pathogenesis in mice. The results of this study demonstrate that PLP2/DUB is an interferon antagonist and a virulence trait of coronaviruses.","publish_time":"2019-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deng, Xufang; Chen, Yafang; Mielech, Anna M.; Hackbart, Matthew; Kesely, Kristina R.; Mettelman, Robert C.; O\u2019Brien, Amornrat; Chapman, Mackenzie E.; Mesecar, Andrew D.; Baker, Susan C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c12e50b9da4b1fde21d68040610b73b8c216bf3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/782409","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PLP2 DUB activity","role of DUB activity","DUB mutant virus","protease activity","DUB mutation","DUBmut virus infections","wild-type virus infection","polyprotein processing activity","ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2","termed PLP2","PLP2 acts","ubiquitin complex","ubiquitin moieties","interferon response","ubiquitin-binding residues results","IFN response","coronavirus pathogenesis","ubiquitin-conjugated proteins","earlier type","reduced pathogenesis","de-conjugating ubiquitin","DUBmut-infected mice","host interferon","interferon antagonist","identification of critical determinants of PLP2","viral replication","viral replicase polyprotein","coronavirus papain","cultured macrophages","structure-guided mutagenesis approach","X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis","viral titer","innate immune response","recombinant murine coronavirus","post-infection","multifunctional proteins","multifunctional papain","study","identical catalytic residues","virulence trait of coronaviruses","functional studies","earlier times","cultured cells","host environment","amino acid substitutions","negative regulator","spleens","modified substrates","molecules","day","livers","Ala","enzyme","similar liver pathology","significant reduction","genetic economy","Asp1772","domain"],"language":"en"},

We sought to evaluate the utilization and diagnostic yield of blood cultures during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine prevalence and common etiologies of bacteremia, and to inform a diagnostic approach to relieve blood culture overutilization. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 88,201 blood cultures from 28,011 patients at a multicenter network of hospitals within New York City to evaluate order volume, positivity rate, time to positivity, and etiologies of positive cultures in COVID-19. Ordering volume increased by 34.8% in the second half of March 2020 compared to the first half of the month. The rate of bacteremia was significantly lower among COVID-19 patients (3.8%) than COVID-19 negative patients (8.0%) and those not tested (7.1%), p \u003C 0.001. COVID-19 patients had a high proportion of organisms reflective of commensal skin microbiota, reducing the bacteremia rate to 1.6% when excluded. More than 98% of all positive cultures were detected within 4 days of incubation. Bloodstream infections are very rare for COVID-19 patients, which supports the judicious use of blood cultures in the absence of compelling evidence for bacterial co-infection.

Starting in the 2018-19 season, we have been enrolling individuals with acute respiratory illness from community sites throughout the Seattle metropolitan area, including clinics, childcare facilities, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, workplaces, college campuses, and homeless shelters. At these sites, we collect clinical data and mid-nasal swabs from individuals with at least two acute respiratory symptoms. Additionally, we collect residual nasal swabs and data from individuals who seek care for respiratory symptoms at four regional hospitals. Samples are tested using a multiplex molecular assay, and influenza whole genome sequencing is performed for samples with influenza detected. Geospatial mapping and computational modeling platforms are in development to characterize the regional spread of influenza and other respiratory pathogens. Ethics and Dissemination.

To better understand the evolution of the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, in this paper, we analyze the codon usage pattern of 2019-nCoV. For this purpose, we compare the codon usage of 2019-nCoV with that of other 30 viruses belonging to the subfamily of orthocoronavirinae. We found that 2019-nCoV shows a rich composition of AT nucleotides that strongly influences its codon usage, which appears to be not optimized to human host. Then, we study the evolutionary pressures influencing the codon usage and evolutionary rates of the sequences of five conserved genes that encode the corresponding proteins (viral replicase, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) characteristic of coronaviruses. We found different patterns of both mutational bias and nature selection that affect the codon usage of these genes at different extents. Moreover, we show that the two integral membrane proteins proteins (matrix and envelope) tend to evolve slowly by accumulating nucleotide mutations on their genes. Conversely, genes encoding nucleocapsid (N), viral replicase and spike proteins are important targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs, tend to evolve faster as compared to other ones. Taken together, our results suggest that the higher evolutionary rate observed for these two genes could represent a major barrier in the development of antiviral therapeutics 2019-nCoV.","publish_time":"2020-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dilucca, Maddalena; Forcelloni, Sergio; Pavlopoulou, Athanasia; Georgakilas, Alexandros G.; Giansanti, Andrea","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9985735fed3f1303ec474a04a7cce3f0e18565c1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.006569","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["nCoV","codon usage pattern","spike proteins","conserved genes","integral membrane proteins proteins","corresponding proteins","viral replicase","envelope","nucleocapsid","evolutionary rates","evolutionary pressures","severe acute respiratory illness","development of antiviral therapeutics","higher evolutionary rate","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","development of vaccines","antiviral drugs","different patterns","different extents","important targets","nature selection","mutational bias","sequences","matrix","major barrier","mortality","nucleotides","characteristic of coronaviruses","results","accumulating nucleotide mutations","rich composition","paper","subfamily of orthocoronavirinae","purpose","Wuhan","China","human host","ones"],"language":"en"},

The resulting disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019), soon became a pandemic. This study aims to characterize key attributes of the epidemiology of this infection in China. Methods: An age-stratified mathematical model was constructed to describe the transmission dynamics and estimate the age-specific differences in the biological susceptibility to the infection, age-assortativeness in transmission mixing, case fatality rate (CFR), and transition in rate of infectious contacts (and reproduction number R0) following introduction of mass interventions. Results: The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts per day (95% uncertainty interval (UI)=0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years of age, susceptibility to the infection was only 0.06 in those \u226419 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in \u226580 years. The assortativeness in transmission mixing by age was very limited at 0.004 (95% UI=0.002-0.008). Final CFR was 5.1% (95% UI=4.8-5.4%). R0 rapidly declined from 2.1 (95% UI=1.8-2.4) to 0.06 (95% UI=0.05-0.07) following onset of interventions. Conclusion: Age appears to be a principal factor in explaining the patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in China. The biological susceptibility to the infection seems limited among children, intermediate among young to mid-age adults, but high among those \u003E50 years of age. There was no evidence for differential contact mixing by age, consistent with most transmission occurring in households rather than in schools or workplaces.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ayoub, Houssein H; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Mumtaz, Ghina R; Seedat, Shaheen; Awad, Susanne F; Makhoul, Monia; Abu-Raddad, Laith J","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2585ffe08e4631a4ed0d59aa2c41c508bbe0fd69.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058214","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsxNzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["years of age","age-assortativeness","UI","transmission mixing","infection","mid-age adults","age-specific differences","transmission dynamics","China","Coronavirus Disease","biological susceptibility","rate of infectious contacts","infectious contact rate","differential contact mixing","novel coronavirus strain","case fatality rate","patterns of COVID","resulting disease","mathematical model","Final CFR","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","onset of interventions","reproduction number R0","introduction of mass interventions","early epidemic","day","children","transition","SARS-CoV","households","epidemiology","evidence","key attributes","uncertainty interval","principal factor","Background","schools","workplaces","study","Results","Methods","Conclusion","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

The feasibility of rapid clinical-grade manufacturing of virus-specific T cells from convalescent donors has not been demonstrated for this or prior pandemics. Methods One unit of whole blood was collected from each convalescent donor following standard blood bank practices. After the plasma was separated and stored separately, the leukocytes were stimulated using overlapping peptides of SARS-CoV-2, covering the immunodominant sequence domains of the S protein and the complete sequence of the N and M proteins. Thereafter, functionally reactive cells were enriched overnight using an automated device capturing IFN{gamma}-secreting cells. Findings From 1x10[9] leukocytes, 0.56 to 1.16x10[6] IFN{gamma}\u002B T cells were produced from each of the first two donors. Most of the T cells (64% to 71%) were IFN{gamma}\u002B, with preferential enrichment of CD56\u002B T cells, effector memory T cells, and effector memory RA\u002B T cells. TCRV{beta} spectratyping revealed oligoclonal distribution, with over-representation of subfamilies including V{beta}3, V{beta}16 and V{beta}17.

Interpretations This study is limited by small number of donors and absence of recipient data; however, crucial first proof-of-principle data are provided demonstrating the feasibility of clinical-grade production of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells for urgent clinical use, conceivably with plasma therapy concurrently. Our data showing that virus-specific T cells can be detected easily after brief stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides suggest that a parallel diagnostic assay can be developed alongside serology testing.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leung, W.; Soh, T.

Increased ACE2 expression in lower airway cells in active smokers, suggests a potential mechanism whereby PM10 increases vulnerability to COVID-19 disease. Objective To assess the effect of traffic-derived PM10 on human airway epithelial cell ACE2 expression in vitro. Methods PM10 was collected from Marylebone Road (London) using a kerbside impactor. A549 and human primary nasal epithelial cells were cultured with PM10 for 2 h, and ACE2 expression (median fluorescent intensity; MFI) assessed by flow cytometry. We included cigarette smoke extract as a putative positive control. Data were analysed by either Mann-Whitney test, or Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons test. Results PM10 at 10 \u03BCg/mL, and 20 \u03BCg/mL increased ACE2 expression in A549 cells (P\u003C0.05, 0.01 vs. medium control, respectively).

Most countries took two main interventions: suppression like immediate lockdown cities at epicentre or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention as the most feasible way to all countries. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducted a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR that can access effectiveness of mitigation, suppression and hybrid interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan. It extended traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed Infectious-Recovered) model by adding two key features: a direct connection between Exposed and Recovered populations, and separating infections into mild and critical cases. It defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID-19 control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan and London during January, 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results showed that 1) Immediate suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduced the total exposed and infectious populations to 119610, but it has to be consistently maintained at least 90 days (by the middle of April 2020). Its success heavily relied on sufficiently external support from other places of China. This mode were not suitable to other countries that have no sufficient health resources. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period to balance the total infections and economic loss. While the total infectious populations in this scenario would be possibly 2 times than the one taking suppression, economic loss and recovery of London would be less affected. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data was that there were a large portion (probably 62.9% in Wuhan) of self-recovered populations that were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. These people might think they have been healthy at home and did not go to hospital for COVID-19 tests. Early release of intervention intensity potentially increased a risk of the second outbreak. One limitation of our model was that our prediction of infections and deaths depended on a parameter estimation of intervention intensity that presented by average number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. It assumed that each intervention had equivalent effects on the reproduction number R in different regions over time. Practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or other issues of certain county.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yang, Po; Qi, Jun; Zhang, Shuhao; Wang, Xulong; Bi, Gaoshan; Yang, Yun; Sheng, Bin","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0b9ca98b5b7c14688735c1ba7b366fbcc90b31e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20043794","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["London","Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["Wuhan","hybrid intervention of suppression","London cases","Immediate suppression","total infectious populations","recovered populations","infectious individuals","active cases","Susceptible-Exposed Infectious","total infections","effectiveness of mitigation","countries","recovery of London","parameter estimation of intervention intensity","Early release of intervention intensity","isolation of cases","critical cases","mathematical model","stages of COVID","daily number","average number contacts","susceptible individuals","separating infections","hybrid interventions","prediction of infections","Practical effectiveness","economic loss","reproduction number R","main interventions","certain region","immediate lockdown cities","issues of certain county","Recent outbreaks of coronavirus disease","important issue of fitting practical data","different regions","direct connection","equivalent effects","epicentre","passive","feasibility study","key features","limitations","external support","cultures","deaths","control","public dataset","longer period","respect","traditional SEIR","SEMCR","scenario","epidemic","peak healthcare demand","strategies","apparent merits","places of China","paper","sufficient health resources","hospital","weeks","risk","feasible way","simulated results","global pandemic","world","home","success","problem","large portion","tests","parameters","times","days","middle","people"],"language":"en"},

Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible behind this pandemic. The lethality of different viral strains is found to vary in different geographical locations but the molecular mechanism is yet to be known. Methods Available data of whole genome sequencing of different viral strains published by different countries were retrieved and then analysed using Multiple Sequence Alignment and Pair-wise Sequence Alignment leading to Phylogenetic tree construction. Each location and the corresponding genetic variations were screened in depth. Then the variations are analysed at protein level giving special emphasis on Non Synonymous amino acid substitutions. The fatality rates in different countries were matched against the mutation number, rarity of the nucleotide alterations and functional impact of the Non Synonymous changes at protein level, separately and in combination. Findings All the viral strains have been found to evolve from the viral strain of Taiwan (MT192759) which is 100% identical with the ancestor SARS-CoV-2 sequences of Wuhan (NC 045512.2; submitted on 5th Jan, 2020).

Interpretation The fatality outcome depends on three important factors (a) number of mutation (b) rarity of the allelic variation and (c) functional consequence of the mutation at protein level. The molecular divergence, evolved from the ancestral strain (S) lead to extremely lethal (E), lethal(L) and non lethal (N) strains with the involvement of an Intermediate strain(I).","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Banerjee, Shuvam; Dhar, Shrinjana; Bhattacharjee, Sandip; Bhattacharjee, Pritha","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/54bef708e1c63787767ac584461cb124d254fda8.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.027854","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Multiple Sequence Alignment","Pair-wise Sequence Alignment"],"locations":["China","Spain","Sweden"],"keyphrases":["viral genome","different countries","lethality of different viral strains","protein level","genome sequencing of different viral strains","viral strain of Taiwan","mutation number","number of mutation","Nucleocapsid protein","frequent mutation","Synonymous mutations","different geographical locations","functional consequence","functional impact","functional effect","rarity","Synonymous changes","fatality outcome","fatality rates","ancestral strain","Intermediate strain","maximum fatality rate i","Multiple Sequence Alignment","ancestor SARS-CoV","Pair-wise Sequence Alignment","e Italy","Synonymous amino acid substitutions","molecular mechanism","molecular divergence","corresponding genetic variations","Surface glycoprotein","Orf1ab polyprotein","special emphasis","disease","allelic variation","nucleotide alterations","Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus","Spain","lead","Phylogenetic tree construction","global public health emergency","important factors","Methods Available data","sequences of Wuhan","involvement","structure","MT192759","rarest ones","world","depth","Sweden","Transition","pathogen responsible","detection","pandemic","Background COVID","Interpretation","combination","Findings","host body","China"],"language":"en"},

We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category). Most home outbreaks involved three to five cases. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases. Conclusions: All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.","publish_time":"2020-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qian, Hua; Miao, Te; LIU, Li; Zheng, Xiaohong; Luo, Danting; Li, Yuguo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82ac6362753348f6bd9a46989aaa636f0911d93a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyNDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Municipal Health"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identified outbreaks","Home outbreaks","confirmed cases","prefectural cities","major SARS-CoV","indoor space","transport","indoor environmental issues","major characteristics","outdoor environment","dominant category","venue category","local Municipal Health Commissions","entertainment","food","China","homes","shopping","municipalities","categories","enclosed spaces","Case reports","infection risk","single outbreak","pandemic","COVID","Methods","Hubei province","Conclusions","Background","people","venues","Results","countries"],"language":"en"},

The highly lethal nature characteristic to CCHFV restricts research to BSL-4 laboratories, which complicates effective research and developmental strategies. In consideration of antiviral therapies, RNA interference can be used to suppress viral replication by targeting viral genes. RNA interference uses small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to silence genes. The aim of our study was to design siRNAs that inhibit CCHFV replication and can serve as a basis for further antiviral therapies. A549 cells were infected with CCHFV after transfection with the siRNAs. Following 72 hours, nucleic acid from the supernatant was extracted for Droplet Digital PCR analysis. Among the investigated siRNAs we identified four effective candidates against all three segments of CCHF genome: one for the S and M segments, whilst two for the L segment. Consequently, blocking any segment of CCHFV leads to changes in the virus copy number that indicates an antiviral effect of the siRNAs in vitro. The most active siRNAs were demonstrated a specific inhibitory effect against CCHFV in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, we demonstrated the ability of specific siRNAs to inhibit CCHFV replication in vitro. This promising result can be used in future anti-CCHFV therapy developments.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"F\u00F6ldes, Fanni; Madai, M\u00F3nika; Papp, Henrietta; Kemenesi, G\u00E1bor; Zana, Brigitta; Geiger, Lili; Gombos, Katalin; Somogyi, Bal\u00E1zs; Bock-Marquette, Ildik\u00F3; Jakab, Ferenc","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e8e98ac926354236d8aa605535aa49c6fbbe791e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.13.093047","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","CCHFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCHFV replication","segment of CCHFV","investigated siRNAs","active siRNAs","ability of specific siRNAs","antiviral effect","viral replication","future anti-CCHFV therapy developments","effective research","RNA interference","consideration of antiviral therapies","viral genes","specific inhibitory effect","effective candidates","silence genes","public health emergency","segments of CCHF genome","Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus","prioritized diseases of World Health Organization","supernatant","potential","small interfering RNAs","lethal nature characteristic","laboratories","BSL","number","changes","Droplet Digital PCR analysis","dose-dependent manner","absence of efficacious drugs","vaccines","hours","nucleic acid","developmental strategies","basis","transfection","promising result","A549 cells","treatment","study","aim","summary"],"language":"en"},

Consequently, countries have adopted physical distance measures in an attempt to mitigate the uncontrolled spread of the virus. A critical question for policymakers to inform evidence-based practice is if and how physical distance measures slowed the propagation of COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic. Methods This study aims to quantify the effects of physical distance mitigation measures on the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from John Hopkins University on confirmed cases and testing data from the Our World in Data were used in an interrupted time series analysis to estimate the effects of physical distance measures on the growth rates of the pandemic in 12 countries of Asia, Africa, and Europe. Findings We found that physical distance measures produced a significant decrease in the growth rates of the COVID-19 pandemic in five countries (Austria, Belgium, Italy, Malaysia, and South Korea). The test-positivity rate was significant in understanding the slowing growth rate of COVID-19 cases caused by the mitigation measures, as it provides important context that is missing from analysis based only on confirmed case data.

We collected survey data from working adults across different geographical areas in China on 20 and 21 February 2020 during the outbreak of COVID-19. The sample contains 308 working adults, who were in various parts of China, with varying distance to the epicenter of Wuhan. The distance of individual adults to the epicenter was negatively associated with life satisfaction ({beta} = -0.235, 95% CI -0.450 to -0.020, p = 0.032). This association between distance and life satisfaction was significant only for adults who were young or had smaller family sizes.

Different countries have utilised a variety of containment policies with an emphasis on social distancing as a strategy to stop the spread of COVID-19. Quantifying the effects of such policies in different time-scales and comparing the efficacy of various available policies is of utmost importance for policy-makers in different countries. That is even more important when the policy-makers want to plan for long-term strategies and to weigh each option based on its epidemiological effects and socio-economic costs. In the absence of detailed knowledge of the interactions between individuals in a population and the characteristics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus, quantifying the effects of these policies is very difficult. Hence, there is an immediate need for models that can predict the spread of COVID-19 in a population, without the need for such detailed information. In this manuscript, a method is presented that can be used to predict the spread of COVID-19 in any country and under any containment policy imposed separately on different groups in the population. The method tunes the parameters of a known stratified model based on the available data on the spread of COVID-19. The model includes a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and is easy to simulate and easy to understand. As it is presented in this manuscript, the population is divided into age-groups. But given the availability of the data, there is no reason to limit the stratification into only age-groups and we can consider any relevant groups. To estimate the parameters of the model such that it reflects the characteristics of the spread of COVID-19 in a population, the method relies on an optimisation scheme. More specifically, the optimisation scheme estimates the contact rates between different age groups in the population. But a very important and useful feature of the model is that the estimated parameters for one population can be translated and used for any other population with a known age-structure, which in this day and age, includes almost any country or city in the world. Also, it is shown that the method is quite insensitive to the underlying assumptions in the optimisation scheme and also to deliberate or non-deliberate errors that might have occurred in collecting the data. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated using a case study under different containment policies, from an uncontained population to mitigation and suppression policies. Also, we can use the model to quantify the effects of strategies which include switching between different containment policies at pre-determined points in time. The model allows us to quantify the effects of each of these policies on the spread of the disease in a population, in particular, the instantaneous and total numbers of infectious individuals in a population which are important parameters for policy-makers. The simulation results, as explained in the following, provide some insight into various policies and some of the results are possibly counter-intuitive for many people. For example, the model predicts that closing down schools and universities without any other containment policy imposed on older age-groups has almost no impact on the number of patients that might need support-care in hospitals. The method provides an easy-to-use tool to use the information collected on the spread of COVID-19 in a country or region and then use that information in another population which might not have been as widely affected by the disease yet.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bokharaie, Vahid S.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/33807c0c3367aebc5ed29500a4a9cfba882cce16.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.10.20060681","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different containment policies","different groups","uncontained population","spread of COVID","different age groups","various policies","variety of containment policies","containment policy","suppression policies","Different countries","method","older age-groups","policy-makers","known stratified model","efficacy of various available policies","effects of strategies","important parameters","relevant groups","different time-scales","known age-structure","epidemiological effects","optimisation scheme","country","available data","estimated parameters","detailed information","characteristics","SARS-Cov","virus","disease","immediate need","world","manuscript","social distancing","long-term strategies","simulation results","absence of detailed knowledge","non-deliberate errors","total numbers of infectious individuals","utmost importance","pre-determined points","emphasis","contact rates","switching","set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations","interactions","strategy","case study","underlying assumptions","option","impact","mitigation","support-care","number of patients","following","socio-economic costs","easy-to-use tool","insight","models","useful feature","universities","stratification","schools","hospitals","reason","day","city","region","people","availability","capabilities","example"],"language":"en"},

Efforts to control and prevent zoonotic disease have traditionally focused on animal-to-human transmission, or \u201Cspillover\u201D. However, in the modern era, increasing international mobility and commerce facilitate the spread of infected humans, non-human animals (hereafter animals), and their products worldwide, thereby increasing the risk that zoonoses will be introduced to new geographic areas. Imported zoonoses can potentially \u2018spill back\u2019 to infect local wildlife\u2014a danger magnified by urbanization and other anthropogenic pressures that increase contacts between human and wildlife populations. In this way, humans can function as vectors, dispersing zoonoses from their ancestral enzootic systems to establish reservoirs elsewhere in novel animal host populations. Once established, these enzootic cycles are largely unassailable by standard control measures and have the potential to feed human epidemics. Understanding when and why translocated zoonoses establish novel enzootic cycles requires disentangling ecologically complex and stochastic interactions between the zoonosis, the human population, and the natural ecosystem. We address this challenge by delineating potential ecological mechanisms affecting each stage of enzootic establishment\u2014wildlife exposure, enzootic infection, and persistence\u2014applying existing ecological concepts from epidemiology, invasion biology, and population ecology. We ground our study in the neotropics, where four arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of zoonotic origin\u2014yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses\u2014have separately been introduced into the human population.

Since SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences show similarity with those of SARS, we sought to analyze all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes based on the insights obtained from SARS genome specifically focusing on non-coding RNAs. Here, results are presented from the dual approach i.e identifying host encoded miRNAs that might regulate viral pathogenesis as well as identifying viral encoded miRNAs that might regulate host cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogenesis. Analysis utilizing first approach resulted in the identification of 10 host encoded miRNAs that could target the genome of both the viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome). Interestingly our analysis revealed that there is significantly higher number of host miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2 genome as compared to the SARS reference genome. Results from second approach involving SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome identified a set of virus encoded miRNAs which might regulate host signaling pathways. Our analysis further identified a similar \u201CGA\u201D rich motif in SARS-CoV-2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe SARS infections. Hence, we successfully identified human and virus encoded miRNAs that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host miRNAs could target SARS-CoV-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals. We identified non-coding sequences in SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards SARS pathology. The study provides insights into the overlapping sequences among these viruses for their effective inhibition as well as identifying new drug targets that could be used for development of new antivirals.","publish_time":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Periwal, Neha; Sarma, Sankritya; Arora, Pooja; Sood, Vikas","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c4a6e34bd5f707f06713e1be266ff0f8e2ae4c5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.018499","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS genome","SARS reference genome","available SARS-CoV","SARS pathology","severe SARS infections","genome sequences","viral encoded miRNAs","higher number of host miRNAs","viral pathogenesis","host cell","lung pathogenesis","mild pathogenesis","genomes","Analysis","non-coding sequences","overlapping sequences","set of virus","pathways","insights","results","dual approach i","non-coding RNAs","new drug targets","development of new antivirals","GA","rich motif","aid","vital role","effective inhibition","healthy individuals","fact","similarity","study","coronaviruses","novel coronavirus","identification","Wuhan","people","deaths","China"],"language":"en"},

We examined publically available time-series data of laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, the causal agent for COVID-19, to try to explore, using a Bayesian approach, about the sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-based diagnostic test. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 3/28/2020) and city of Philadelphia, USA (available on 3/31/2020). Our analysis revealed that the data were compatible with near-perfect specificity but it was challenging to gain information about sensitivity (prior and posterior largely overlapped). We applied these insights to uncertainty/bias analysis of epidemic curves into jurisdictions under the assumptions of both improving and degrading sensitivity. If the sensitivity improved from 60 to 95%, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within the 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in the shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. In the extreme scenario, hundreds of undiagnosed cases, even among tested, are possible, potentially leading to further unchecked contagion should these cases not self-isolate. The best way to better understand bias in the epidemic curves of COVID-19 due to errors in testing is to empirically evaluate misclassification of diagnosis in clinical settings and apply this knowledge to adjustment of epidemic curves, a task for which the Bayesian method we presented is well-suited.","publish_time":"2020-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Burstyn, Igor; Goldstein, Neal D.; Gustafson, Paul","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ef1652c5807d948f5cda6f94084bedede608625.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057661","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjszNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Alberta"],"keyphrases":["epidemic curves of COVID","adjustment of epidemic curves","bias analysis of epidemic curves","degrading sensitivity","misclassification errors","identification of true cases of COVID","hundreds of undiagnosed cases","available time-series data of laboratory tests","misclassification of diagnosis","perfect specificity","Bayesian method","observed counts","Bayesian approach","SARS-CoV","viral infection","knowledge","task","assumptions","uncertainty","jurisdictions","clinical settings","unchecked contagion","extreme scenario","causal agent","PCR","shape","peak","self-isolate","confidence intervals","city of Philadelphia","information","work","insights","Alberta","Canada","impact","diagnostic test","best way","testing","aim","range"],"language":"en"},

A genome sequence is the core of this virus which interferes with the normal activities of its counterparts within humans. Analysis of its genome may provide clues toward the proper treatment of patients and the design of new drugs and vaccines. Microsatellites are composed of short genome subsequences which are successively repeated many times in the same direction. They are highly variable in terms of their building blocks, number of repeats, and their locations in the genome sequences. This mutability property has been the source of many diseases. Usually the host genome is analyzed to diagnose possible diseases in the victim. In this research, the focus is concentrated on the attacker\u0027s genome for discovery of its malicious properties. Results The focus of this research is the microsatellites of both SARS and Covid-19. An accurate and highly efficient computer method for identifying all microsatellites in the genome sequences is discovered and implemented, and it is used to find all microsatellites in the Coronavirus-Covid-19 and SARS2003. The Microsatellite discovery is based on an efficient indexing technique called K-Mer Hash Indexing. The method is called Fast Microsatellite Discovery (FMSD) and it is used for both SARS and Covid-19. A table composed of all microsatellites is reported.

We then isolated exosomes from the supernatant of A549 cells and detected the presence of viral genome within the purified exosomes.

Accordingly, uptake of exosomes containing viral genes led to an upregulation of inflammation-related genes in hiPSC-CMs. Thus, our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA-containing exosomes represent an indirect route of entry into cardiomyocytes resulting in potential cardiac dysfunction without the need for direct viral infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kwon, Youjeong; Nukala, Sarath Babu; Srivastava, Shubhi; Miyamoto, Hiroe; Ismail, Nur Izzah; Ong, Sang-Bing; Lee, Won Hee; Ong, Sang-Ging","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bb699cc8a4e84d26adf8f14561d9ecbeefa1741a.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.093583","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs0NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral genes","SARS-CoV","uptake of exosomes","presence of viral genome","evidence of direct viral infection","purified exosomes","isolated exosomes","selected genes","related genes","cardiac cells","presence of inflammation","hiPSC-CMs","supernatant of A549 cells","hearts of COVID","patients","severity of COVID","A549 lung epithelial cells","upregulation of inflammation","potential cardiac dysfunction","novel coronavirus disease","human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","lentivirus","need","indirect route of entry","underlying cardiovascular risk factors","ACE2","prevalence","functional receptor","enzyme","expression of angiotensin","Early data","findings","worldwide pandemic"],"language":"en"},

Currently, numerous trials testing potential treatment and preventative options are undertaken all over the world. Objectives We summarised all registered clinical trials examining treatment and prevention options for COVID-19. Additionally, we evaluated the quality of the retrieved studies. Data sources Clinicaltrials.gov, the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and the European Union Clinical Trials Register were systematically searched. Study eligibility criteria Registered clinical trials examining treatment and/or prevention options for COVID-19 were included. No language, country or study design restrictions were applied. We excluded withdrawn or cancelled studies and trials not reporting therapeutic or preventative strategies for COVID-19. Participants and interventions: No restrictions in terms of participants\u2019 age and medical background or type of intervention were enforced. Methods The registries were searched using the term \u201Ccoronavirus\u201D or \u201CCOVID-19\u201D from their inception until 26th March 2020.Additional manual search of the registries was also performed. Eligible studies were summarised and tabulated. Interventional trials were methodologically analysed, excluding expanded access studies and trials testing Traditional Chinese Medicine. Results In total, 309 trials evaluating therapeutic management options, 23 studies assessing preventive strategies and 3 studies examining both were retrieved. Finally, 214 studies were methodologically reviewed.

Nsp9 is thought to bind RNA via a fold that is unique to this class of betacoronoaviruses although the molecular basis for this remains ill-defined. We sought to better characterise the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 protein and subsequently solved its X-ray crystal structure, in an apo-form and, unexpectedly, in a peptide-bound form with a sequence originating from a rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (LEVL). The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 revealed the high level of structural conservation within the Nsp9 family. The exogenous peptide binding site is close to the dimer interface and impacted on the relative juxtaposition of the monomers within the homodimer.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of several adjuvant treatments in preventing severe pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 564 consecutively hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha Public Health Treatment Center, First Hospital of Yueyang, Junshan People\u0027s Hospital of Yueyang, Central Hospital of Shaoyang, Central Hospital of Xiangtan, Second Hospital of Changde, Central Hospital of Loudi, and First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China in Hunan province from January 17, 2020 to February 28, 2020; The final date of follow-up was March 15, 2020. EXPOSURES Nonspecific antivirals (arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon \u03B1), antihypertensives, and chloroquine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia; Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Of 564 patients, the median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-58 years), and 284 (50.4%) patients were men. Sixty-nine patients (12.2%) developed severe pneumonia. Patients who developed severe pneumonia were older (median age of 59 and 45 years, respectively), and more patients had comorbidities including hypertension (30.4% and 12.3%, respectively), diabetes (17.4% and 6.7%, respectively), and cardiovascular disease (8.7% and 3.2%, respectively) and presented with fever (84.1% and 60.4%, respectively) and shortness of breath (10.1% and 3.8%, respectively) compared with those who did not. Nonspecific antiviral therapy did not prevent clinical progression to severe pneumonia, although fewer hypertensive patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) therapy developed severe pneumonia in contrast with those on non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive therapy (1 of 16 [6.3%] patients and 16 of 49 [32.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 26.4%; 95% CI, 1.5% to 41.3%]). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension without receiving ACEI/ARB therapy was an independent risk factor (odds ratio [OR], 2.07; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.00) for developing severe pneumonia irrespective of age. Besides, none of patients treated with chloroquine developed severe pneumonia, though without significance (difference, 12.0%; 95% CI, -3.5% to 30.0%) by propensity score matching. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hypertensive patients on ACEI or ARB may be protective from severe pneumonia in COVID-19 and hence these therapies should not be ceased unless there is a strong indication or further epidemiological evidence. Though none of the current antiviral and immunoregulation therapy showed benefit in preventing COVID-19 progression, chloroquine deserved further investigation.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Zhichao; Li, Jennifer; Yao, Shanhu; Yu, Qizhi; Zhou, Wenming; Mao, Xiaowen; Li, Huiling; Kang, Wendi; Ouyang, Xin; Mei, Ji; Zeng, Qiuhua; Liu, Jincai; Ma, Xiaoqian; Rong, Pengfei; Wang, Wei","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d54a30cff3933545aed099cf0b608a97c920a45.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.08.20057539","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China","ARB"],"locations":["Hunan"],"keyphrases":["severe pneumonia","hospitalized patients","development of severe COVID","fewer hypertensive patients","RELEVANCE Hypertensive patients","Hospital of Changde","ARB therapy","Central Hospital of Shaoyang","Central Hospital of Loudi","Central Hospital of Xiangtan","Affiliated Hospital of University","confirmed COVID","Xiangya Hospital of Central South University","ARB antihypertensive therapy","Junshan People\u0027s Hospital of Yueyang","immunoregulation therapy","Nonspecific antiviral therapy","years","chloroquine","non-ACEI","clinical progression","median age","effective treatment","clinical deterioration","treatment data","hypertension","difference","South China","epidemiological evidence","cardiovascular disease","Changsha Public Health Treatment Center","angiotensin-receptor blockers","EXPOSURES Nonspecific antivirals","ABSTRACT IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease","lopinavir","enzyme inhibitors","independent risk factor","PARTICIPANTS Multicenter","retrospective cohort study","laboratory","benefit","Demographic","high mortality","ritonavir","arbidol","MEASURES","contrast","interferon \u03B1","interquartile range","Multivariate logistic regression analysis","adjuvant treatments","SETTING","odds ratio","global pandemic","Hunan province","CONCLUSIONS","MAIN OUTCOMES","role","DESIGN","strong indication","antihypertensives","significance","final date of follow-up","propensity score matching","investigation","comorbidities","RESULTS","shortness of breath","OBJECTIVE","therapies","diabetes","fever"],"language":"en"},

The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease. Methods and analysis: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. Patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery. Ethics and dissemination: The trial protocol has been approved at the Investigation Review Boards of Xijing Hospital (Xi an, China) and The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) is pending.

We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. The experience of outbreak control in mainland China should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including South Korea.","publish_time":"2020-03-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, Biao; Xia, Fan; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Wang, Xia; He, Sha; Sun, Xiaodan; Tang, Sanyi; Xiao, Yanni; Wu, Jianhong","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43c2cd88c9ebe5dc5fc9a42e5d52552cb7ecb628.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033464","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Guangdong","China","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["South Korea","mainland China","Guangdong province of China","epidemic characteristics","epidemic trend","effective reproduction numbers","specific interventions","effectiveness of interventions","integrated package of interventions","initial basic reproduction number","stringent public health interventions","days","integrated approach","different scenarios","different settings","serial interval","confidence interval","comparative study of COVID","disease transmission dynamics models","mean","key","entirety","multi-source data","portion","rest","guiding reference","standard deviation","experience of outbreak control","world","success","provinces","burden","order","need","threshold","infections","epicenter"],"language":"en"},

Presently, there is no vaccine available against this emerged viral disease. Therefore, it is indeed a need of the hour to develop an effectual and safe vaccine against this decidedly pandemic disease. In the current study, we collected SARS-CoV-2 genome from Indian geographical origin against human host, further more using reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics tools here we claim effective vaccine candidates that can be mile stone in battle against COVID19. This novel study divulged two promising antigenic peptide GVYFASTEK and NFRVQPTESIV from surface glycoproteins (protein accession no. \u2013 QIA98583.1 and QHS34546.1) of SARS-CoV-2, which were predicated to be interacted with class I and class II MHC alleles and showed up to 90% conservancy and high value of antigenicity. Subsequently, the molecular docking studies were verified molecular interaction of these prime antigenic peptides with the residues of HLA-A*11-01 allele for MHC Class I and HLA DRB1*04-01 allele for MHC class II. After vigorous analysis, these peptides were predicted to be suitable epitopes which are capable to elicit the strong cell-mediated immune response against the SARS-CoV-2. Consequences from the present study could facilitate selecting SARS-CoV-2 epitopes for vaccine production pipelines in the immediate future.

The model extends a basic epidemiological model and assumes that a specified fraction of a population dons masks at a given initial number of infections. The model includes a contribution from the ocular (nasolacrimal duct) route, and does not include contributions from contact (fomite) routes. The model accommodates dose-response (probability of infection) functions that are linear or non-linear. Our motivation to study near-population-wide mask wearing arises from the concept that, between two mask wearers, the concentration of particles at inhalation should be the square of the mask penetration fraction. This combination, or team, of masks can provide a strong dose-lowering squaring effect, which enables the use of lower-efficiency, lower-cost, lower pressure-drop (easier breathing) masks. For an epidemic with basic reproduction number R0=2.5 and with a linear dose-response, the critical mask efficiency is calculated to be 0.5 for a mask adoption level of 0.8 of the population. Importantly, this efficiency is well below that of a N95 mask, and well above that of some fabric masks. Numerical solutions of the model at near-critical levels of mask efficiency and mask adoption demonstrate avoidance of epidemics. To be conservative we use mask efficiencies measured with the most-penetrating viral-particle sizes. The critical mask adoption level for surgical masks with an efficiency of 0.58 is computed to be 0.73. With surgical masks (or equally efficient substitutes) and 80% and 90% adoption levels, respiratory epidemics with R0 of about 3 and 4, respectively, would be theoretically extinguished.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kot, A.

In Italy, there is a continued COVID-19 growth of cases and deaths that requires control measures for the correct management of the epidemiological emergency. To contribute to increasing the overall knowledge of COVID-19, systematic tests in the general population are required. Here, we describe the first Italian survey performed in 727 employees belonging to a Mother-Child Research hospital tested for both viral (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs) and antibody presence. Individuals were divided into three risk categories (high, medium and low) according to their job activity. Only one subject was positive at the swab test while 17.2% of the cohort was positive for the presence of antibodies. Results highlighted that the presence of Positive antibodies is significantly associated with high and medium risk exposure occupation (p-value=0.026) as well as cold and conjunctivitis symptoms (p-value=0.016 and 0.042 respectively). Moreover, among healthcare professionals, the category of medical doctors showed a significant association with the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (p-value=0.0127). Finally, we detected a rapid decrease in antibody intensity between two assessments performed within a very short period (p-value=0.009). Overall, the present study increases our knowledge of the epidemiological data of COVID-19 infection in Italy, suggesting a high prevalence of immune individuals (i.e. at least among at-risk categories) and the efficacy of the combined diagnostic protocol to monitor the possible outbreak.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Comar, Manola; Brumat, Marco; Concas, Maria Pina; Argentini, Giorgia; Bianco, Annamonica; Bicego, Livia; Bottega, Roberta; Carli, Petra; Cassone, Andrea; Catamo, Eulalia; Cocca, Massimiliano; Del Pin, Massimo; Di Stazio, Mariateresa; Feresin, Agnese; La Bianca, Martina; Morassut, Sara; Morgan, Anna; Pelliccione, Giulia; Petix, Vincenzo; Ragusa, Giulia; Robino, Antonietta; Russian, Stefano; Spedicati, Beatrice; Suergiu, Sarah; Urriza, Marianela; Vascotto, Fulvia; Toscani, Paola; Girotto, Giorgia; Gasparini, Paolo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9c73205f1f2ad5ae5df300ffd6d075a93221c531.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.19.20071563v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs1ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["p-value","presence of antibodies","presence of Positive antibodies","antibody presence","overall knowledge of COVID","continued COVID","epidemiological data of COVID","SARS-CoV","Italy","high prevalence of immune individuals","medium risk exposure occupation","antibody intensity","at-risk categories","epidemiological emergency","worldwide fragile health care system","significant association","category of medical doctors","control measures","assessments","correct management","efficacy","growth of cases","novel coronavirus","oropharyngeal swabs","infection","combined diagnostic protocol","Mother-Child Research hospital","global threat","systematic tests","employees","deaths","conjunctivitis symptoms","short period","possible outbreak","healthcare professionals","fast spread","rapid decrease","swab test","general population","subject","cohort","present study","Italian survey","job activity","Results"],"language":"en"},

Attenuation typically relies on de-optimisation of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinculeotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily-informed attenuation strategies, that aim to force nucleotide usage against the estimated direction favoured by selection, here we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias towards T with concomitant selection against T. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed TT content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. A significantly different mutational profile at CDS sites that are not 4-fold degenerate is consistent with contemporaneous selection against T mutations more widely. Although selection against CpG dinucleotides is expected to drive synonymous site G\u002BC content below mutational equilibrium, observed G\u002BC content is slightly above equilibrium, possibly because of selection for higher expression. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily informed gene-bespoke approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results.","publish_time":"2020-05-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rice, Alan M.; Morales, Atahualpa Castillo; Ho, Alexander T.; Mordstein, Christine; M\u00FChlhausen, Stefanie; Watson, Samir; Cano, Laura; Young, Bethan; Kudla, Grzegorz; Hurst, Laurence D.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e310214ee503c0c1bc1bc8b52276fba662a1a0e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.088112","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CpG","T.

The aim of our study was to use the official data and predict the possible outcomes of the COVID 19 pandemic using artificial intelligence (AI) based RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), then compare and validate the predicted and observed data. Materials and Methods: We used the publicly available datasets of World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University to create the training dataset, then have used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with gated recurring units (Long Short Term Memory: LSTM units) to create 2 Prediction Models. Information collected in the first t time steps were aggregated with a fully connected (dense) neural network layer and a consequent regression output layer to determine the next predicted value. We used root mean squared logarithmic errors (RMSLE) to compare the predicted and observed data, then recalculated the predictions again. Results: The result of our study underscores that the COVID19 pandemic is probably a propagated source epidemic, therefore repeated peaks on the epidemic curve (rise of the daily number of the newly diagnosed infections) are to be anticipated. The errors between the predicted and validated data and trends seems to be low. Conclusions: The influence of this pandemic is great worldwide, impact our everyday lifes. Especially decision makers must be aware, that even if strict public health measures are executed and sustained, future peaks of infections are possible. The AI based predictions might be useful tools for predictions and the models can be recalculated according to the new observed data, to get more precise forecast of the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kolozsvari, Laszlo Robert; Berczes, Tamas; Hajdu, Andras; Gesztelyi, Rudolf; TIba, Attila; Varga, Imre; Szollosi, Gergo Jozsef; Harsanyi, Szilvia; Garboczy, Szabolcs; Zsuga, Judit","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c64f9fc33b20d3ad9e96e86896834cd38b7483c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20069666v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","Johns Hopkins University","Prediction Models"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID19 pandemic","official data","validated data","predictions","new observed data","predicted value","Recurrent Neural Networks","RNNs","neural network layer","future peaks of infections","LSTM units","coronavirus disease","repeated peaks","epidemic curve","strict public health measures","major global health problem","possible outcomes","study underscores","logarithmic errors","diagnosed infections","Prediction Models","available datasets of World Health Organization","gated recurring units","propagated source epidemic","consequent regression output layer","current form of severe acute respiratory syndrome","Johns Hopkins University","Short Term Memory","training dataset","RMSLE","artificial intelligence","useful tools","daily number","root mean","influence","SARSCoV2","trends","precise forecast","everyday lifes","Objectives","t time steps","Information","decision makers","Methods","Results","Conclusions","Materials","aim"],"language":"en"},

We retrospectively collected 5372 patients with computed tomography images from 7 cities or provinces. Firstly, 4106 patients with computed tomography images and gene information were used to pre-train the DL system, making it learn lung features. Afterwards, 1266 patients (924 with COVID-19, and 471 had follow-up for 5\u002B days; 342 with other pneumonia) from 6 cities or provinces were enrolled to train and externally validate the performance of the deep learning system. In the 4 external validation sets, the deep learning system achieved good performance in identifying COVID-19 from other pneumonia (AUC=0.87 and 0.88) and viral pneumonia (AUC=0.86). Moreover, the deep learning system succeeded to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups whose hospital-stay time have significant difference (p=0.013 and 0.014). Without human-assistance, the deep learning system automatically focused on abnormal areas that showed consistent characteristics with reported radiological findings. Deep learning provides a convenient tool for fast screening COVID-19 and finding potential high-risk patients, which may be helpful for medical resource optimization and early prevention before patients show severe symptoms.","publish_time":"2020-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Shuo; Zha, Yunfei; Li, Weimin; Wu, Qingxia; Li, Xiaohu; Niu, Meng; Wang, Meiyun; Qiu, Xiaoming; Li, Hongjun; Yu, He; Gong, Wei; Bai, Yan; Li, Li; Zhu, Yongbei; Wang, Liusu; Tian, Jie","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042317","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["automatic deep learning system","potential high-risk patients","fast screening COVID","Fast diagnosis of COVID","computed tomography images","medical resources optimization","early prevention","medical resource optimization","cities","provinces","viral pneumonia","AUC","good performance","pre-train","gene information","worse prognosis","time","hospital","consistent characteristics","abnormal areas","convenient tool","low-risk groups","prognostic analysis","external validation sets","reported radiological findings","significant difference","severe symptoms","human-assistance","regions","days","Coronavirus disease","lung features","follow-up"],"language":"en"},

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemics strain health systems and households. Health systems in Africa and South Asia may be particularly at risk due to potential high prevalence of risk factors for severe disease, large household sizes and limited healthcare capacity. Methods. We investigated the impact of an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic on health system resources and costs, and household costs, in Karachi, Delhi, Nairobi, Addis Ababa and Johannesburg. We adapted a dynamic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease to capture country-specific demography and contact patterns. The epidemiological model was then integrated into an economic framework that captured city-specific health systems and household resource use. Findings. The cities severely lack intensive care beds, healthcare workers and financial resources to meet demand during an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic. A highly mitigated COVID-19 epidemic, under optimistic assumptions, may avoid overwhelming hospital bed capacity in some cities, but not critical care capacity. Interpretation. Viable mitigation strategies encompassing a mix of responses need to be established to expand healthcare capacity, reduce peak demand for healthcare resources, minimise progression to critical care and shield those at greatest risk of severe disease.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davies, N.

However, the similarity between features of CXR images of COVID-19 and pneumonia caused by other infections make the differential diagnosis by radiologists challenging. We hypothesized that machine learning-based classifiers can reliably distinguish the CXR images of COVID-19 patients from other forms of pneumonia. We used a dimensionality reduction method to generate a set of optimal features of CXR images to build an efficient machine learning classifier that can distinguish COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with high accuracy and sensitivity. By using global features of the whole CXR images, we were able to successfully implement our classifier using a relatively small dataset of CXR images. We propose that our COVID-Classifier can be used in conjunction with other tests for optimal allocation of hospital resources by rapid triage of non-COVID-19 cases.","publish_time":"2020-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zargari Khuzani, A.; Heidari, M.; Shariati, A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/581c3b2c98f7acca6f219d5a28af624938faf22b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.09.20096560v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S.

Among these, 178 recombinant monoclonal antibodies were tested positive for antigen binding, and 17 strong binders to S1 or RBD were identified with Kd(EC50) below 1 nM. Importantly, 12 antibodies could block pseudoviral entry into HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2, with the best ones showing IC50 around 2-3 nM. From these 12 antibodies, we had tested two in authentic virus infection assay, and found one was able to effectively block live viral entry with IC50 around or below 15 nM.

Therefore, it is significant to understand the epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective and observational study, we collected data from 167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (Chongqing, China) from January to March 2020. The epidemiological characteristics and variable of these patients were collected and analyzed. Findings: 82.04% of the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients had a travel history in Wuhan or a history of contact with returnees from Wuhan, showing typical characteristics of imported cases, and the proportion of severe Covid-19 patients was 13.2%, of which 59% were imported from Wuhan. For the patients who was returnees from Wuhan, 18.1% was asymptomatic patients. In different infection periods, compared with the proportion after 1/31/2020, the proportion of asymptomatic patient among SARS-CoV-2 infected patient was higher(19% VS 1.5%). In different age groups, the proportion of asymptomatic patient was the highest(28.6%) in children group under 14, next in elder group over 70 (27.3%). Compared with mild and common Covid-19 patients, the mean latency of asymptomatic was longer (11.25 days VS 8.86 days), but the hospital length of stay was shorter (14.3 days VS 16.96 days) . Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 prevention needs to focus on the screening of asymptomatic patients in the community with a history of contact with the imported population, especially for children and the elderly population.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tao, Y.; Cheng, P.; Chen, W.; Wan, P.; Chen, Y.; Yuan, G.; Chen, J.; Huo, D.; Guan, G.; Sun, D.; Tan, J.; Yang, G.; Zeng, W.; Zhu, C.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3fe2ed04f26d0c9b6928cdaa58113672a28a1741.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.16.20037259v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzMyLmNzdjs3OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1966158,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"kYs3ngblDce1PKnEUKPmuA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_32.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Chongqing Public Health Medical Center"],"locations":["China","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["emergence of asymptomatic patients","SARS-CoV","infected patients","screening of asymptomatic patients","epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic patients","proportion of asymptomatic patient","Wuhan","days VS","mean latency of asymptomatic","history of contact","imported population","proportion of severe Covid","travel history","typical characteristics of imported cases","returnees","different infection periods","prevention","children group","single-center","common Covid","elderly population","elder group","Chongqing Public Health Medical Center","different age groups","difficulties","community","observational study","hospital length of stay","China","data","global pandemic","variable","Methods","epidemic","Conclusion","Background","Findings"],"language":"en"},

Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery.

This respiratory tract infection is unprecedented in that it targets the most distal and highly vulnerable aspect of the human bronchopulmonary tree, specifically, the alveoli that are responsible for the loading of oxygen upon red cell hemoglobin for use by all of the body\u0027s tissues. In most symptomatic individuals, the reaction is a productive and mild immune-mediated syndrome, with limited damage to the lung tissues. About 20% of those affected experience a virus capable of producing what can only be described as a cataclysmic set of immune activation responses that can culminate in the diffuse and irreversible obliteration of the distal alveoli, that then leads to a virtual collapse of the gas-exchange apparatus. Here, in Part I of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we define severe COVID-19 as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus\u0027 ability to trigger what we now designate for the first time, as a \u2018Prolific Activation of a Network-Immune-Inflammatory Crisis\u2019, or \u2018PANIC\u2019 Attack, in the alveolar tree.

Methods: We conducted a literature review of studies (n=12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n=11) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. Results: The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses than typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression.

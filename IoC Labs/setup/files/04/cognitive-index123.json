Thus some clues about the role of protein-bound carbohydrate can be obtained by comparing the biochemical fates and functions of glycosylated proteins with their non-glycosylated counterparts, or with proteins exhibiting differences in the type of oligosaccharide side chains. Cells infected with enveloped viruses are good systems for studying both aspects of protein glycosylation, since they contain a limited number of different glycoproteins, often with well-defined functions. Tunicamycin, and antibiotic, as well as several sugar analogues have been found to act as inhibitors of protein glycosylation by virtue of their anti-viral properties. They interfere with various steps in the dolichol pathway resulting in a lack of functional-linked oligosaccharide precursors. Compounds that interfere with oligosaccharide trimming represent a second generation of inhibitors of glycosylation. They are glycosidase inhibitors that interfere with the processing glucosidases and mannosidases and, as a result, the conversion of high-mannose into complex-type oligosaccharides is blocked. Depending upon the compound used, glycoproteins contain glucosylated-high-mannose, high-mannose or hybrid oligosaccharide structures instead of complex ones. The biological consequences of the alterations caused by the inhibitors are manifold: increased susceptibility to proteases, improper protein processing and misfolding of polypeptide chains, loss of biological activity and alteration of the site of virus-budding, to name but a few.","publish_time":"2003-01-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"McDowell, William; Schwarz, Ralph T.","journal":"Biochimie","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126144/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzgyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inhibitors of protein glycosylation","aspects of protein glycosylation","dolichol pathway of protein glycosylation","high-mannose","improper protein processing","role of protein","type of oligosaccharide","oligosaccharide trimming","generation of inhibitors","glycosidase inhibitors","linked oligosaccharide precursors","glucosylated-high","functions of glycosylated proteins","conversion of high","processing of asparagine","hybrid oligosaccharide structures","processing glucosidases","different steps","complex-type oligosaccharides","linked oligosaccharides","complex ones","limited number of different glycoproteins","well-defined functions","various steps","biological consequences","non-glycosylated counterparts","misfolding of polypeptide chains","loss of biological activity","proteases","virtue","lack of functional","increased susceptibility","good systems","enveloped viruses","site of virus","anti-viral properties","biochemical fates","differences","Cells","mannosidases","result","bound carbohydrate","alterations","antibiotic","budding","Compounds","clues","sugar analogues","Tunicamycin"],"language":"en"},

HIV-1 gp120 binding proteins of the CD4-negative and Gal-C-negative, non-productively infectable human glioblastoma cell line D54 were purified by affinity chromatography over a gp120-conjugated sepharose column and identified by peptide microsequencing. The binding capacity and specificity of this column was controlled using extracts of CD4-positive cells. Two of seven prominent proteins eluted from the gp120 affinity column specifically bound gp120 in Western blot overlay experiments and were identified by subsequent immunoblotting and microsequencing as ezrin and moesin, members of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) family of cellular structural membrane proteins. Antibodies to ezrin and moesin specifically recognized the eluted gp120 binding proteins confirming their identification. Ezrin and moesin are structural proteins binding to the cellular membrane and to several cytoskeletal and transmembrane proteins.

In this study, the potential RNA pseudoknots just downstream from the known and suspected retroviral frameshift sites were predicted in the Rous sarcoma virus, primate immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV), equine infectious anemia virus, visna virus, bovine leukemia virus, human T-cell leukemia virus (types I and II), mouse mammary tumor virus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, and simian SRV-1 type-D retrovirus. Also, the putative RNA pseudoknots were detected in the gag-pol overlaps of two retrotransposons of Drosophila, 17.6 and gypsy, and the mouse intracisternal A particle. For each sequence, the thermodynamic stability and statistical significance of the secondary structure involved in the predicted tertiary structure were assessed and compared. Our results show that the stem-loop structures in the pseudoknots are both thermodynamically highly stable and statistically significant relative to other such configurations that potentially occur in the gag-pool or gag-pro and pro-pol junction domains of these viruses (300 nucleotides upstream and downstream from the possible frameshift sites are included). Moreover, the structural features of the predicted pseudoknots following the frameshift site of propol overlaps of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 retroviruses are structurally well conserved. The occurence of eight compensatory base changes in the tertiary interaction of the two related sequences allow the conservation of their tertiary structures in spite of the sequence divergence. The results support the possible control mechanism for frameshifting proposed by Brierley et al. [1] and Jacks et al.

Typically, researchers focus on people with clinical pain, or on healthy participants undergoing laboratory-controlled pain-induction techniques focussed mostly on exogenously generated skin nociception. Less commonly investigated are acute pain experiences that emerge naturally. Six common painful complaints were identified: headache, muscular pain, visceral pain, menstrual pain, dental pain, and pain associated with upper respiratory tract infection. Methods used to recruit participants with the natural occurrence of each pain complaint were identified, and features of their use reviewed. Also reviewed were experimental analogues designed to mimic these pains, with the exception of menstrual pain. Headache and menstrual pain appear to be most effectively researched in their naturally occurring form, whereas muscle and dental pain may be more easily induced. Upper respiratory tract infection and abdominal pain provide further challenges for researchers.

Mild central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, such as headache and drowsiness, can result from systemically elevated cytokine levels and therefore are common in many virus infections, even in the absence of the infection of the CNS. CNS infection is quite unusual and is initiated either as a result of the viremia or, more rarely, as a result of neural spread. The poliovirus infects the anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, causing poliomyelitis, the disease for which the virus is named. DNA vaccination is a relatively new entrant in the vaccine sweepstakes, but is viewed with optimism, for a number of reasons. DNA vaccines encoding the nucleoprotein from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can confer protection against the normally lethal intracranial challenge. In rabies, in a mouse model, immunization with plasmids encoding the rabies glycoprotein conferred complete protection against subsequent viral challenge. Several virus-induced CNS diseases may be explained by their triggering of autoimmunity. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a well-characterized CNS disease induced by the administration of certain CNS proteins.","publish_time":"2004-01-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindsay Whitton, J.; Fujinami, Robert S.","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130639/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzMyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CNS infection","virus-induced CNS diseases","virus infections","well-characterized CNS disease","administration of certain CNS proteins","DNA vaccines","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus","DNA vaccination","Mild central nervous system","result of neural spread","complete protection","rabies glycoprotein","subsequent viral challenge","lethal intracranial challenge","spinal cord","plasmids","anterior horn motor neurons","symptoms","immunization","new entrant","Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis","nucleoprotein","poliovirus","mouse model","absence","vaccine sweepstakes","elevated cytokine levels","optimism","drowsiness","poliomyelitis","headache","number of reasons","chapter","triggering of autoimmunity","viremia"],"language":"en"},

Our aim was to analyse admissions due to respiratory infections in moderate, late and term infants, and to identify risk factors for hospitalisation in preterm versus term. METHODS: Prospective study in a cohort of moderate and late preterm, and term infants born between October/2011 and December/2012. Admissions due to respiratory infections during the first year of life were analysed and compared among moderate (32\u201333), late (34\u201336) and term infants. Sixteen respiratory viruses were detected by RT-PCR. Clinical data were collected. RESULTS: 30 (20.9%) out of 143 preterm infants required admission for respiratory infection, versus 129 (6.9%) of 1858 term infants born in the same period (p \u003C 0.0001, OR: 3.6 CI 2.0 to 5.0). Hospitalised children had a higher prevalence of hyaline membrane disease (HMD) at birth (p \u003C 0.001, OR: 7.7 CI: 2.121 to 27.954) and needed more mechanical ventilation (p \u003C 0.001, OR: 5.7 CI: 1.813 to 18.396). Virus was identified in 25/30 (83%) preterm babies, and in 110/129 (85%) term infants. The most frequent viruses in preterm infants were RSV (76%) rhinovirus (20%). Clinical and epidemiological characteristics among term and preterm infants were similar. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of respiratory admissions during the first year of life is up to 3.6 times higher in moderate and late preterm. Once admitted, clinical features of respiratory episodes requiring hospitalisation are similar among term and preterm infants. Hyaline membrane disease and mechanical ventilation were also risk factors for respiratory admissions.","publish_time":"2014-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olabarrieta, I.; Gonzalez-Carrasco, E.; Calvo, C.; Pozo, F.; Casas, I.; Garc\u00EDa-Garc\u00EDa, M.L.","journal":"Allergol Immunopathol (Madr)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7130830.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130830/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM1Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["preterm infants","respiratory infections","respiratory viruses","preterm babies","risk of respiratory admissions","Respiratory viral infections","clinical features of respiratory episodes","CI","cohort of moderate","year of life","risk factors","major cause of hospitalisation","mechanical ventilation","Clinical data","higher prevalence of hyaline membrane disease","times higher","frequent viruses","HMD","RSV","epidemiological characteristics","Prospective study","birth","severe symptoms","Hospitalised children","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","period","RT-PCR","rhinovirus","aim","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Attachment is followed by a redistribution or capping of virus particles on the cell surface which may play a role in the uptake process. Certain viruses penetrate the plasma membrane directly but many, both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, are endocytosed at coated pits and subsequently pass into endosomes. The low pH environment of the endosome facilitates passage of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. For some viruses the mechanism of membrane penetration is now known to be linked to a pH-mediated conformational change in external virion proteins. As a consequence of infection there are alterations in the permeability of the plasma membrane which may contribute to cellular damage. Recent advances in the understanding of these processes are reviewed and their relevance to the development of new strategies for vaccines emphasised.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patterson, S.; Oxford, J.S.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131068/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host cell plasma membrane","mechanism of membrane penetration","non-enveloped viruses","Certain viruses","virus infection","cell surface","viral genome","virus particles","consequence of infection","low pH environment","Viral recognition of specific receptors","conformational change","passage","step","external virion proteins","relevance","development of new strategies","role","alterations","permeability","coated pits","understanding","processes","vaccines","redistribution","Recent advances","cellular damage","uptake process","endosomes","cytoplasm","Attachment"],"language":"en"},

The sequence of its 18 N terminal amino acids was determined and found to be very similar to that of mammalian aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2). Indeed aminopeptidase N activity was efficiently immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody 180K1. The purified antigen gives a broad band at 180 kDa after SDS-gel electrophoresis, which, after treatment by endoglycosidase F, is converted to a thinner band at 140 kDa. This antigen is therefore heavily glycosylated. Depending on solubilization conditions, both the antigen and peptidase activity were recovered either as a broad peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 18S (2% CHAPS) or as a single peak of 7.8S (1% CHAPS plus 0.2 % C(12)E(9)), showing that Torpedo aminopeptidase N behaves as an oligomer stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, easily converted into a 160 kDa monomer. The antigen is highly concentrated in the apical membrane of proximal tubule epithelial cells (600 gold particles/\u03BCm(2) of brush border membrane) whereas no labeling could be detected in other cell types or in other membranes of the same cells (basolat\u00E9ral membranes, vacuoles or vesicles).

Sera genes form a multigene family and are generally tandemly clustered on a single chromosome. Although all Plasmodium species encode multiple sera genes, the number varies between species. Among species, the members share similar sequences and gene organization. SERA possess a central papain-like cysteine protease domain, however, in some members, the active site cysteine residue is substituted with a serine. Recent studies implicate this gene family in a number of aspects in parasite biology and induction of protective immune response. This review summarizes the current understanding on this important gene family in several Plasmodium species. The Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)-sera family, for example, consists of nine gene members. Unlike other multigene families in Plasmodium species, Pf-sera genes do not exhibit antigenic variation. Pf-sera5 nucleotide diversity is also low. Moreover, although Pf-sera5 is highly transcribed during the blood stage of malaria infection, and a large amount is released into the host blood following schizont rupture, in malaria endemic countries the sero-positive rates for Pf-SERA5 are low, likely due to Pf-SERA5 binding of host proteins to avoid immune recognition. As an antigen, the N-terminal 47 kDa domain of Pf-SERA5 is a promising vaccine candidate currently undergoing clinical trials. Pf-SERA5 and Pf-SERA6, as well as P. berghei (Pb)-SERA3, and Pb-SERA5, have been investigated for their roles in parasite egress. Two P. yoelii SERA, which have a serine residue at the protease active center, are implicated in parasite virulence. Overall, these studies provide insight that during the evolution of the Plasmodium parasite, the sera gene family members have increased by gene duplication, and acquired various functions that enable the parasite to survive and successfully maintain infection in the host.

To fill this gap, we present a novel approach to study how the topological structure of complex network influences the concrete process of epidemic spreading. After transforming the network structure into hierarchical layers, we introduce a set of new parameters, i.e., the average fractions of degree for outgoing, ingoing, and remaining in the same layer, to describe the infection process. We find that this set of parameters are closely related to the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient but are more convenient than them in describing the process of epidemic spreading. Moreover, we find that the networks with exponential distribution have slower spreading speed than the networks with power-law degree distribution.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the MEDLINE (1966\u2013August 2004) and InternationalPharmaceutical Abstracts (1970\u2013August 2004) databases with the search terms daptomycin, LY146032, and lipopeptide antibiotics. Abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and documents submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration were also reviewed. RESULTS: Phase III study results suggest no difference in efficacy or tolerability between daptomycin 4 mg/kgIV QD and vancomycin or semisynthetic penicillins for complicated skin and skin-structure infections. Animal studies suggest daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of endocarditis. Daptomycin is not indicated for pneumonia, with poorer outcomes than conventional treatment It is available as an IV medication and exhibits 92% plasma protein binding in vitro. In healthy adult humans, daptomycin has a volume of distribution of 0.1 Ukg and a plasma elimination half-life of \u223C9 hours, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (\u223C54%). In patients with reduced renal function, including those receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the dose interval should be 48 hours. No dosage adjustment appears to be necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. The use of daptomycin in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been assessed. The most commonly reported adverse events include constipation, nausea, injection-site reactions, headache, and diarrhea. Patients should also be monitored regularly for skeletal muscle toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin may be useful for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and gram-positive pathogens resistant to conventional antimicrobials. However, limited data are currently available for duration of treatment beyond 14 days and at doses \u003E4 mg/kg QD.","publish_time":"2005-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeu, LilyAnn; Fung, Horatio B.","journal":"Clin Ther","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133638/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzYzOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Daptomycin"],"organizations":["US Food and Drug Administration"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of daptomycin","search terms daptomycin","complicated skin","patients","skin-structure infections","conventional treatment","duration of treatment","treatment of endocarditis","hours","severe hepatic impairment","moderate hepatic impairment","Antimicrobial Agents","efficacy ofdaptomycin","conventional antimicrobials","antimicrobial therapy","study results","kgIV QD","literature search","renal excretion","InternationalPharmaceutical Abstracts","plasma elimination half-life","plasma protein binding","reduced renal function","semisynthetic penicillins","gram-positive pathogens resistant","nausea","Chemotherapy","vancomycin","difference","injection-site reactions","constipation","hemodialysis","Ukg","documents","Interscience Conference","LY146032","US Food","dose interval","volume of distribution","poorer outcomes","peritoneal dialysis","headache","pharmacology","potential roles","Phase","IV medication","pneumonia","tolerability","healthy adult humans","adverse events","lipopeptide antibiotics","article","Drug Administration","diarrhea","safety profile","limited data","pharmacokinetics","days","doses","databases","Animal studies","dosage adjustment","skeletal muscle toxicity","OBJECTIVES","aims","METHODS","MEDLINE","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Monoclonal antibodies specific for IFN-\u03B3, CD4 and CD8 molecules were administered in vivo to deplete selectively the IFN-y synthesized or the appropriate subset of T cells. The animals were then infected with MHV3 and the course of infection was followed by studying different parameters, such as, the mortality, the virus growth in the tissues and the IFN-\u03B3 synthesis in sera and peritoneal exudates. After MHV3 infection, a full resistance of control A/J mice was observed, in contrast to the high mortality rate observed among the depleted animals, where higher virus titers were found in different tissues. The IFN-\u03B3 synthesis in sera and peritoneal exudates of depleted mice, after MHV3 infection, drastically decreased when compared to that detected in control mice.

The structure was refined to 1.96 \u212B resolution and revealed three dimers in the asymmetric unit. The mutual arrangement of the protomers in each of the dimers suggests that M(pro) self-processing occurs in trans. The active site, comprised of Cys144 and His41, is part of a chymotrypsin-like fold that is connected by a 16 residue loop to an extra domain featuring a novel \u03B1-helical fold. Molecular modelling and mutagenesis data implicate the loop in substrate binding and elucidate S1 and S2 subsites suitable to accommodate the side chains of the P1 glutamine and P2 leucine residues of M(pro) substrates.

The disease has been etiologically linked to a novel coronavirus that has been named the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), whose genome was recently sequenced. Since it is a member of the Coronaviridae, its spike protein (S2) is believed to play a central role in viral entry by facilitating fusion between the viral and host cell membranes. The protein responsible for viral-induced membrane fusion of HIV-1 (gp41) differs in length, and has no sequence homology with S2. RESULTS: Sequence analysis reveals that the two viral proteins share the sequence motifs that construct their active conformation. These include (1) an N-terminal leucine/isoleucine zipper-like sequence, and (2) a C-terminal heptad repeat located upstream of (3) an aromatic residue-rich region juxtaposed to the (4) transmembrane segment. CONCLUSIONS: This study points to a similar mode of action for the two viral proteins, suggesting that anti-viral strategy that targets the viral-induced membrane fusion step can be adopted from HIV-1 to SARS-CoV. Recently the FDA approved Enfuvirtide, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal heptad repeat of HIV-1 gp41, as an anti-AIDS agent.

During an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in March 2003, hybridization to this microarray revealed the presence of a previously uncharacterized coronavirus in a viral isolate cultivated from a SARS patient. To further characterize this new virus, approximately 1 kb of the unknown virus genome was cloned by physically recovering viral sequences hybridized to individual array elements. Sequencing of these fragments confirmed that the virus was indeed a new member of the coronavirus family.

GIS have much more to offer than the obvious digital cartography (map) functions. From a community health perspective, GIS could potentially act as powerful evidence-based practice tools for early problem detection and solving. When properly used, GIS can: inform and educate (professionals and the public); empower decision-making at all levels; help in planning and tweaking clinically and cost-effective actions, in predicting outcomes before making any financial commitments and ascribing priorities in a climate of finite resources; change practices; and continually monitor and analyse changes, as well as sentinel events. Yet despite all these potentials for GIS, they remain under-utilised in the UK National Health Service (NHS). This paper has the following objectives: (1) to illustrate with practical, real-world scenarios and examples from the literature the different GIS methods and uses to improve community health and healthcare practices, e.g., for improving hospital bed availability, in community health and bioterrorism surveillance services, and in the latest SARS outbreak; (2) to discuss challenges and problems currently hindering the wide-scale adoption of GIS across the NHS; and (3) to identify the most important requirements and ingredients for addressing these challenges, and realising GIS potential within the NHS, guided by related initiatives worldwide. The ultimate goal is to illuminate the road towards implementing a comprehensive national, multi-agency spatio-temporal health information infrastructure functioning proactively in real time.

The characterization of cellular genes required for virus infection and/or cell killing will be essential for understanding viral life cycles, and may provide cellular targets for new antiviral therapies. RESULTS: A gene entrapment approach was used to identify candidate cellular genes that affect reovirus infection or virus induced cell lysis. Four of the 111 genes disrupted in clones selected for resistance to infection by reovirus type 1 involved the insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-II) pathway, including: the mannose-6-phosphate/IGF2 receptor (Igf2r), a protease associated with insulin growth factor binding protein 5 (Prss11), and the CTCF transcriptional regulator (Ctcf). The disruption of Ctcf, which encodes a repressor of Igf2, was associated with enhanced Igf2 gene expression. Plasmids expressing either the IGF-II pro-hormone or IGF-II without the carboxy terminal extension (E)-peptide sequence independently conferred high levels of cellular resistance to reovirus infection. Forced IGF-II expression results in a block in virus disassembly. In addition, Ctcf disruption and forced Igf2 expression both enabled cells to proliferate in soft agar, a phenotype associated with malignant growth in vivo. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that IGF-II, and by inference other components of the IGF-II signalling pathway, can confer resistance to lytic reovirus infection. This report represents the first use of gene entrapment to identify host factors affecting virus infection. Concomitant transformation observed in some virus resistant cells illustrates a potential mechanism of carcinogenesis associated with chronic virus infection.","publish_time":"2004-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sheng, Jinsong; Organ, Edward L; Hao, Chuanming; Wells, K Sam; Ruley, H Earl; Rubin, Donald H","journal":"BMC Cell Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26bdc177821e0161d138236656dafefe2f9f6900.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC517494.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC517494/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTCF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chronic virus infection","lytic reovirus infection","virus disassembly","Igf2 expression","virus resistant cells","expression results","disruption of Ctcf","Ctcf disruption","virus induced cell lysis","enhanced Igf2 gene expression","candidate cellular genes","characterization of cellular genes","reovirus type","cellular targets","host cell","IGF2 receptor","repressor of Igf2","insulin growth factor","high levels of cellular resistance","gene entrapment approach","use of gene entrapment","malignant growth","CTCF transcriptional regulator","viral life cycles","enabled cells","host factors","signalling pathway","potential mechanism of carcinogenesis","peptide sequence","protease","Prss11","different steps","carboxy terminal extension","soft agar","intracellular parasites","phenotype","phosphate","Igf2r","new antiviral therapies","protein","block","Concomitant transformation","BACKGROUND","Viruses","components","mannose","inference","pro-hormone","addition","clones","report","CONCLUSION","Plasmids"],"language":"en"},

The rationale behind starting a journal dedicated to globalization and health is three fold: Firstly: Globalization is reshaping the social geography within which we might strive to create health or prevent disease. The determinants of health \u2013 be they a SARS virus or a predilection for fatty foods \u2013 have joined us in our global mobility. Driven by economic liberalization and changing technologies, the phenomenon of \u0027access\u0027 is likely to dominate to an increasing extent the unfolding experience of human disease and wellbeing. Secondly: Understanding globalization as a subject matter itself needs certain benchmarks and barometers of its successes and failings. Health is one such barometer. It is a marker of social infrastructure and social welfare and as such can be used to either sound an alarm or give a victory cheer as our interconnectedness hurts and heals the populations we serve. And lastly: In as much as globalization can have an effect on health, it is also true that health and disease has an effect on globalization as exemplified by the existence of quarantine laws and the devastating economic effects of the AIDS pandemic. A balanced view would propose that the effects of globalization on health (and health systems) are neither universally good nor bad, but rather context specific. If the dialogue pertaining to globalization is to be directed or biased in any direction, then it must be this: that we consider the poor first.","publish_time":"2005-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Greg","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d706e82e2ebc8571e70654d1acf0ffd3969ab2d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1143779.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1143779/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEwOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of globalization","health systems","determinants of health","debut editorial of Globalization","access\u0027","social welfare","social geography","devastating economic effects","marker of social infrastructure","scope of subject matter","unfolding experience of human disease","economic liberalization","peer reviewed academic journals","increasing extent","important format","barometers","certain benchmarks","existence of quarantine laws","SARS virus","predilection","successes","phenomenon","wellbeing","AIDS pandemic","technologies","fatty foods","interconnectedness","victory cheer","objectives","goals","context specific","alarm","failings","balanced view","dialogue pertaining","global mobility","populations","publishing","rationale","direction","poor"],"language":"en"},

Class I viral fusion proteins, such as those encoded by influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), contain two prominent alpha helices. Peptides that mimic portions of these alpha helices inhibit structural rearrangements of the fusion proteins and prevent viral infection. The envelope glycoprotein (E) of flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and dengue virus (DENV), are class II viral fusion proteins comprised predominantly of beta sheets. We used a physio-chemical algorithm, the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale (WWIHS) [1] in combination with known structural data to identify potential peptide inhibitors of WNV and DENV infectivity that target the viral E protein. Viral inhibition assays confirm that several of these peptides specifically interfere with target virus entry with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the 10 \u03BCM range. Inhibitory peptides similar in sequence to domains with a significant WWIHS scores, including domain II (IIb), and the stem domain, were detected. DN59, a peptide corresponding to the stem domain of DENV, inhibited infection by DENV (\u003E99% inhibition of plaque formation at a concentrations of \u003C25 \u03BCM) and cross-inhibition of WNV fusion/infectivity (\u003E99% inhibition at \u003C25 \u03BCM) was also demonstrated with DN59. However, a potent WNV inhibitory peptide, WN83, which corresponds to WNV E domain IIb, did not inhibit infectivity by DENV. Additional results suggest that these inhibitory peptides are noncytotoxic and act in a sequence specific manner. The inhibitory peptides identified here can serve as lead compounds for the development of peptide drugs for flavivirus infection.","publish_time":"2005-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hrobowski, Yancey M; Garry, Robert F; Michael, Scott F","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6d7084462a7462edc93ce2d350bf6dd08c232ef4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1177995.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1177995/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["WNV fusion","Viral fusion proteins","viral infection","DENV infectivity","potent WNV inhibitory peptide","stem domain of DENV","Inhibitory peptides similar","Viral inhibition assays","WNV E domain IIb","target virus entry","viral E protein","dengue virus","influenza virus","inhibitory concentration","potential peptide inhibitors of WNV","virion-target cell membrane fusion","cross-inhibition","human immunodeficiency virus","West Nile virus","development of peptide drugs","cell entry","inhibited infection","flavivirus infection","Class","inhibition of plaque formation","\u03BCM range","DN59","prominent alpha helices","structural rearrangements","known structural data","significant WWIHS scores","sequence specific manner","domains","Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale","flaviviruses","act","HIV","WN83","noncytotoxic","physio-chemical algorithm","series of conformational changes","combination","lead compounds","concentrations","IC50","portions","beta sheets","envelope glycoprotein","Additional results"],"language":"en"},

During enteric infections, proteolysis of the reovirus outer capsid protein \u03C33 is mediated by pancreatic serine proteases. In contrast, the proteases critical for reovirus replication in the lung are unknown. Neutrophil elastase (NE) is an acid-independent, inflammatory serine protease predominantly expressed by neutrophils. In addition to its normal role in microbial defense, aberrant expression of NE has been implicated in the pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because reovirus replication in rodent lungs causes ARDS-like symptoms and induces an infiltration of neutrophils, we investigated the capacity of NE to promote reovirus virion uncoating. RESULTS: The human promonocyte cell line U937 expresses NE. Treatment of U937 cells with the broad-spectrum cysteine-protease inhibitor E64 [trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane] and with agents that increase vesicular pH did not inhibit reovirus replication. Even when these inhibitors were used in combination, reovirus replicated to significant yields, indicating that an acid-independent non-cysteine protease was capable of mediating reovirus uncoating in U937 cell cultures. To identify the protease(s) responsible, U937 cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an agent that induces cellular differentiation and results in decreased expression of acid-independent serine proteases, including NE and cathepsin (Cat) G. In the presence of E64, reovirus did not replicate efficiently in PMA-treated cells. To directly assess the role of NE in reovirus infection of U937 cells, we examined viral growth in the presence of N-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val chloromethylketone, a NE-specific inhibitor. Reovirus replication in the presence of E64 was significantly reduced by treatment of cells with the NE inhibitor. Incubation of virions with purified NE resulted in the generation of infectious subviron particles that did not require additional intracellular proteolysis. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that NE can facilitate reovirus infection. The fact that it does so in the presence of agents that raise vesicular pH supports a model in which the requirement for acidic pH during infection reflects the conditions required for optimal protease activity. The capacity of reovirus to exploit NE may impact viral replication in the lung and other tissues during natural infections.","publish_time":"2005-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Golden, Joseph W; Schiff, Leslie A","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dff6195f5e24ebfa2fb4060142611b48021f673c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1180477.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1180477/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzEyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reovirus replication","capacity of reovirus","NE inhibitor","reovirus infection of U937 cells","role of NE","capacity of NE","purified NE","reovirus virion uncoating","NE-specific inhibitor","aberrant expression of NE","Treatment of U937 cells","capable of mediating reovirus uncoating","treatment of cells","viral replication","presence of E64","reovirus outer capsid protein \u03C33","inflammatory serine protease","independent serine proteases","presence of agents","PMA-treated cells","acid-independent non-cysteine protease","broad-spectrum cysteine-protease inhibitor E64","U937 cell cultures","presence of N","vesicular pH","pancreatic serine proteases","optimal protease activity","decreased expression of acid","Ala-Ala","human promonocyte cell line U937","RESULTS","ARDS","proteases critical","acidic pH","enteric infections","normal role","viral growth","respiratory tracts","natural infections","infiltration of neutrophils","additional intracellular proteolysis","pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome","microbial defense","Pro-Val chloromethylketone","conditions","trans-epoxysuccinyl","hosts","symptoms","cellular differentiation","rodent lungs","generation of infectious subviron particles","acetate","model","combination","requirement","tissues","phorbol","significant yields","cathepsin","Mammalian reoviruses","leucylamido","guanidino","myristate","Incubation of virions","contrast","findings","Neutrophil elastase","BACKGROUND","butane","CONCLUSION","inhibitors","fact"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND FINDINGS: First, we use analytical methods to show that (i) ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods (when including the latent period) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data. We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak. Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options.

METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys of IDUs in 5 sites in Lang Son Province, Vietnam (n = 348) and 3 sites in Ning Ming County, Guangxi Province, China (n = 308). Respondents were recruited through peer referral (\u0022snowball\u0022) methods in both countries, and also from officially recorded lists of IDUs in Vietnam. A risk behavior questionnaire was administered and HIV counseling and testing conducted. RESULTS: Participants in both countries were largely male, in their 20s, and unmarried. A majority of subjects in both countries were members of ethnic minority groups. There were strong geographic gradients for length of drug injecting and for HIV seroprevalence. Both mean years injecting and HIV seroprevalence declined from the Vietnamese site farthest from the border to the Chinese site farthest from the border. 10.6% of participants in China and 24.5% of participants in Vietnam reported crossing the international border in the 6 months prior to interview. Crossing the border by IDUs was associated with (1) distance from the border, (2) being a member of an ethnic minority group, and (3) being HIV seropositive among Chinese participants. CONCLUSION: Reducing the international spread of HIV among IDUs will require programs at the global, regional, national, and \u0022local cross border\u0022 levels. At the local cross border level, the programs should be coordinated on both sides of the border and on a sufficient scale that IDUs will be able to readily obtain clean injection equipment on the other side of the border as well as in their country of residence.","publish_time":"2005-08-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Des Jarlais, Don C; Johnston, Patrick; Friedmann, Patricia; Kling, Ryan; Liu, Wei; Ngu, Doan; Chen, Yi; Hoang, Tran V; Donghua, Meng; Van, Ly K; Tung, Nguyen D; Binh, Kieu T; Hammett, Theodore M","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7d6a4a17160dee1235864e5860da782093e4d07b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1232855.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1232855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE0Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ning Ming County, Guangxi Province"],"locations":["Vietnam","China"],"keyphrases":["international border area","HIV seroprevalence","local cross border level","HIV prevalence","HIV counseling","HIV seropositive","lists of IDUs","international spread of HIV","countries","Chinese participants","length of drug injecting","injecting drug users","Cross-sectional surveys of IDUs","patterns of injecting drug use","sites","programs","China","Chinese site","METHODS","Guangxi Province","members of ethnic minority groups","Vietnamese site","Lang Son Province","major heroin trans-shipment route","Ning Ming County","strong geographic gradients","snowball","sufficient scale","risk behavior questionnaire","peer referral","clean injection equipment","mean years","months","levels","majority of subjects","Respondents","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","testing","interview","RESULTS","sides","country of residence","distance"],"language":"en"},

The semantics of the epitope domain and related concepts were captured as a hierarchy of classes, which represent the general and specialized relationships between the various concepts. A complete listing of classes and their properties can be found at . CONCLUSION: The IEDB\u0027s ontology is the first ontology specifically designed to capture both intrinsic chemical and biochemical information relating to immune epitopes with information relating to the interaction of these structures with molecules derived from the host immune system.

We have studied a new method for the sequence-specific visual detection of minute amounts of nucleic acids using precipitation reaction by addition of cationic polymers to amplicons of Loop mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP). RESULTS: Oligo DNA probes labeled with different fluorescent dyes were prepared for multiple nucleic acid templates, and the templates were amplified by the LAMP reactions under the existence of the probes. At completion of the LAMP reaction, an optimal amount of low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI) was added, resulting in the precipitation of the insoluble LAMP amplicon-PEI complex. The fluorescently labeled Oligo DNA probes hybridized to the LAMP product were incorporated into the precipitation, and the precipitate emitted fluorescence corresponding to the amplified nucleic acid templates. The color of emitted fluorescence can be detected easily by naked eye on a conventional UV illuminator. CONCLUSION: The presence or absence of minute amount of nucleic acid templates could be detected in a simple manner through visual assessment for the color of the LAMP amplicon-PEI complex precipitate. We conclude that this detection method may facilitate development of small and simple g-POCT device.","publish_time":"2006-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mori, Yasuyoshi; Hirano, Tsuyoshi; Notomi, Tsugunori","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6bf372c094f035a514975c35a7f9c094abbe493.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1373654.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1373654/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LAMP reactions","LAMP product","amplified nucleic acid templates","precipitation reaction","multiple nucleic acid templates","LAMP amplicon-PEI complex precipitate","insoluble LAMP amplicon-PEI complex","gene amplification reaction","Oligo DNA probes","simple g-POCT device","results","color of emitted fluorescence","precipitate emitted fluorescence","sequence-specific visual detection of minute amounts of nucleic acids","care testing device","innovative detection methods","absence of minute","visual assessment","development of small","isothermal Amplification","simple manner","new method","practical gene point","addition of cationic polymers","different fluorescent dyes","amplicons of Loop","low molecular weight polyethylenimine","naked eye","conventional UV illuminator","use of expensive equipment","presence","BACKGROUND","existence","CONCLUSION","completion"],"language":"en"},

To address this issue, we developed a computational method that identifies the conserved viral sequences at the genus level for all viral genomes available in GenBank, and established a virus probe library. The virus probes are used not only to identify known viruses but also for discerning the genera of emerging or uncharacterized ones. RESULTS: Using the microarray approach, the identity of the virus in a test sample is determined by the signals of both genus and species-specific probes. The genera of emerging and uncharacterized viruses are determined based on hybridization of the viral sequences to the conserved probes for the existing viral genera. A detection and classification procedure to determine the identity of a virus directly from detection signals results in the rapid identification of the virus. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the validity and feasibility of the above strategy with a small number of viral samples. The probe design algorithm can be applied to any publicly available viral sequence database. The strategy of using separate genus and species probe sets enables the use of a straightforward virus identity calculation directly based on the hybridization signals.

If such a strain emerges, and is not controlled at source [2,3], a pandemic is likely to result. Health policy in most countries will then be focused on reducing morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimate the expected reduction in primary attack rates for different household-based interventions using a mathematical model of influenza transmission within and between households. We show that, for lower transmissibility strains [2,4], the combination of household-based quarantine, isolation of cases outside the household, and targeted prophylactic use of anti-virals will be highly effective and likely feasible across a range of plausible transmission scenarios. For example, for a basic reproductive number (the average number of people infected by a typically infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population) of 1.8, assuming only 50% compliance, this combination could reduce the infection (symptomatic) attack rate from 74% (49%) to 40% (27%), requiring peak quarantine and isolation levels of 6.2% and 0.8% of the population, respectively, and an overall anti-viral stockpile of 3.9 doses per member of the population. Although contact tracing may be additionally effective, the resources required make it impractical in most scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: National influenza pandemic preparedness plans currently focus on reducing the impact associated with a constant attack rate, rather than on reducing transmission. Our findings suggest that the additional benefits and resource requirements of household-based interventions in reducing average levels of transmission should also be considered, even when expected levels of compliance are only moderate.","publish_time":"2006-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Joseph T; Riley, Steven; Fraser, Christophe; Leung, Gabriel M","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bd6e33d92632dfcba4056a2d7355ced5b7ab1fd.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f6686ac18c05ec72b33fbed5485fc922531d2529.json; document_parses/pdf_json/6fe7dbbe77090cf3a1ac5ce68b0aca877c08dd71.json; document_parses/pdf_json/84ad793db6fd5878929791f4a2f50943881206f1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/76481505399740984fe9bf11fdfec984fbf11e32.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1526768.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1526768/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIzOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["combination of household","average levels of transmission","different household-based interventions","based quarantine","isolation levels","levels of compliance","mathematical model of influenza transmission","resource requirements of household","constant attack rate","range of plausible transmission scenarios","FINDINGS","susceptible population","National influenza pandemic preparedness","pathogenic H5N1 influenza","primary attack rates","average number of people","isolation of cases","expected reduction","peak quarantine","basic reproductive number","novel human strain","overall anti-viral stockpile","targeted prophylactic use of anti-virals","wild birds","domestic poultry","possible evolution","doses","global concern","additional benefits","infectious individual","member","outbreak","CONCLUSIONS","infection","example","impact","lower transmissibility strains","Health policy","countries","BACKGROUND","resources","contact tracing","households","morbidity","mortality","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

However, growth of live-virus vaccines must be attenuated to minimize their potential pathogenic effects, and mechanisms of attenuation by conventional serial-transfer viral adaptation are not well-understood. New methods of attenuation based on rational engineering of viral genomes may offer a potentially greater control if one can link defined genetic modifications to changes in virus growth. To begin to establish such links between genotype and growth phenotype, we developed a computer model for the intracellular growth of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a well-studied, nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA virus. Our model incorporated established regulatory mechanisms of VSV while integrating key wild-type infection steps: hijacking of host resources, transcription, translation, and replication, followed by assembly and release of progeny VSV particles. Generalization of the wild-type model to allow for genome rearrangements matched the experimentally observed attenuation ranking for recombinant VSV strains that altered the genome position of their nucleocapsid gene. Finally, our simulations captured previously reported experimental results showing how altering the positions of other VSV genes has the potential to attenuate the VSV growth while overexpressing the immunogenic VSV surface glycoprotein. Such models will facilitate the engineering of new live-virus vaccines by linking genomic manipulations to controlled changes in virus gene-expression and growth.","publish_time":"2006-09-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Kwang-il; Lang, Tobias; Lam, Vy; Yin, John","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4c84dbfd01f7b2009ebed54376da8afcbcf1ec64.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1557587.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1557587/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["VSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["VSV growth","virus growth","growth of live","VSV genes","engineering of new live-virus vaccines","growth phenotype","virus gene-expression","intracellular growth of vesicular stomatitis virus","recombinant VSV strains","established regulatory mechanisms of VSV","mechanisms of attenuation","release of progeny VSV particles","immunogenic VSV surface glycoprotein","negative-stranded RNA virus","subunit vaccines","wild-type model","computer model","New methods of attenuation","changes","viral adaptation","rational engineering of viral genomes","genome position","genome rearrangements","nucleocapsid gene","key wild-type infection steps","potential pathogenic effects","genomic manipulations","host resources","assembly","conventional serial","cell-mediated immunity","defined genetic modifications","transcription","translation","replication","greater control","positions","immune protection","experimental results","single boosting","links","genotype","Generalization","simulations","models"],"language":"en"},

Hence, their occurrence in epithelium of the airways might be expected but, nonetheless, has not yet been examined. METHODS: Western blotting, real-time quantitative PCR analysis of abraded tracheal epithelium and laser-assisted microdissection combined with subsequent mRNA analysis were used to examine the expression of cav-1 and cav-2, two major caveolar coat proteins, in rat tracheal epithelium. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was performed to locate caveolae and cav-1 and -2 in the airway epithelium of rats, mice and humans. Electron-microscopic analysis was used for the identification of caveolae. CLSM-FRET analysis determined the interaction of cav-1\u03B1 and cav-2 in situ. RESULTS: Western blotting and laser-assisted microdissection identified protein and transcripts, respectively, of cav-1 and cav-2 in airway epithelium. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of abraded tracheal epithelium revealed a higher expression of cav-2 than of cav-1. Immunoreactivities for cav-1 and for cav-2 were co-localized in the cell membrane of the basal cells and basolaterally in the ciliated epithelial cells of large airways of rat and human. However, no labeling for cav-1 or cav-2 was observed in the epithelial cells of small bronchi. Using conventional double-labeling indirect immunofluorescence combined with CLSM-FRET analysis, we detected an association of cav-1\u03B1 and -2 in epithelial cells. The presence of caveolae was confirmed by electron microscopy. In contrast to human and rat, cav-1-immunoreactivity and caveolae were confined to basal cells in mice. Epithelial caveolae were absent in cav-1-deficient mice, implicating a requirement of this caveolar protein in epithelial caveolae formation. CONCLUSION: These results show that caveolae and caveolins are integral membrane components in basal and ciliated epithelial cells, indicating a crucial role in these cell types. In addition to their physiological role, they may be involved in airway infection.","publish_time":"2006-08-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Krasteva, Gabriela; Pfeil, Uwe; Drab, Marek; Kummer, Wolfgang; K\u00F6nig, Peter","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3ebb8d173e6297001673ec3ce3bb14e5c1cb9715.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1563466.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1563466/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interaction of cav","association of cav","higher expression of cav","epithelial caveolae formation","basal cells","identification of caveolae","presence of caveolae","rat tracheal epithelium","epithelial cells of small bronchi","CLSM-FRET analysis","ciliated epithelial cells of large airways of rat","real-time quantitative PCR analysis of abraded tracheal epithelium","airway epithelium of rats","Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of abraded tracheal epithelium","Electron-microscopic analysis","subsequent mRNA analysis","microdissection","laser","cell membrane","Western blotting","caveolar protein","RESULTS","deficient mice","airway infection","crucial role","cell types","physiological role","electron microscopy","integral membrane components","major caveolar coat proteins","signal transduction","caveolins","diverse cellular functions","cholesterol homeostasis","indirect immunofluorescence","endo","requirement","METHODS","immunoreactivity","conventional double","transcytosis","humans","transcripts","contrast","entry sites","microorganisms","addition","Fluorescence immunohistochemistry","BACKGROUND","occurrence","CONCLUSION","situ","Immunoreactivities"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included. RESULTS: Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days. CONCLUSION: The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.","publish_time":"2006-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kramer, Axel; Schwebke, Ingeborg; Kampf, G\u00FCnter","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2884fdee6db20fa38c7ad56008b0ff4b84eeb41d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1564025.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1564025/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus","Klebsiella"],"organizations":["VRE","HBV","HSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["months","Inanimate surfaces","dry surfaces","days","persistence of different nosocomial pathogens","common nosocomial pathogens","Herpes viruses","outbreaks of nosocomial infections","important nosocomial fungal pathogen","duration of persistence","type of surface","rhino virus","rota virus","gastrointestinal tract","respiratory tract","Candida albicans","Candida parapsilosis","gram-positive bacteria","HSV type","continuous source of transmission","regular preventive surface disinfection","Proteus vulgaris","Klebsiella","Haemophilus influenzae","Acinetobacter","Pseudomonas aeruginosa","corona","coxsackie","SARS","HAV","Escherichia coli","Bordetella pertussis","MRSA","Serratia","spore","polio","astrovirus","experimental evidence","CMV","data","Vibrio cholerae","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","Streptococcus pyogenes","MedLine","VRE","standard textbooks","Staphylococcus aureus","addition","cited articles","reports","Enterococcus","yeasts","Clostridium difficile","CONCLUSION","Torulopsis glabrata","literature","language restrictions","review","topic","gram-negative species","Mycobacteria","Shigella","RESULTS","HBV","HIV","BACKGROUND","METHODS","aim","hours","Blood","week"],"language":"en"},

Here, we demonstrate for the first time that antisense oligonucleotides can functionally mimic these RNA structures to induce \u002B1 ribosomal frameshifting when annealed downstream of the frameshift site, UCC UGA. Antisense-induced shifting of the ribosome into the \u002B1 reading frame is highly efficient in both rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions and in cultured mammalian cells. The efficiency of antisense-induced frameshifting at this site is responsive to the sequence context 5\u2032 of the shift site and to polyamine levels.","publish_time":"2006-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Henderson, Clark M.; Anderson, Christine B.; Howard, Michael T.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1ad13d83e926979dbf2bbe52e4944082f28dfea.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1616946.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1616946/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI5MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","UCC UGA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["induced frameshifting","ribosomal frameshifting","programmed frameshifting","frameshift site","ORF1","RNA structures","open reading frame","antisense oligonucleotides","efficiency of antisense","overlapping reading frames","RNA secondary structures","eukaryotic cells","product of standard translation","cultured mammalian cells","gene expression mechanism","rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions","proteins","proportion of translating ribosomes","pseudoknots","viruses","information","sequence context","ORF2 fusion protein","cis-stimulators","production","subset of cellular genes","loops","stem","UCC UGA","polyamine levels","result","time"],"language":"en"},

The pathogenicity of S. epidermidis has been attributed to its capacity to form biofilms on surfaces of medical devices, which greatly increases its resistance to many conventional antibiotics and often results in chronic infection. It has an urgent need to design novel antibiotics against staphylococci infections, especially those can kill cells embedded in biofilm. RESULTS: In this report, a series of novel inhibitors of the histidine kinase (HK) YycG protein of S. epidermidis were discovered first using structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) from a small molecular lead-compound library, followed by experimental validation. Of the 76 candidates derived by SBVS targeting of the homolog model of the YycG HATPase_c domain of S. epidermidis, seven compounds displayed significant activity in inhibiting S. epidermidis growth. Furthermore, five of them displayed bactericidal effects on both planktonic and biofilm cells of S. epidermidis. Except for one, the compounds were found to bind to the YycG protein and to inhibit its auto-phosphorylation in vitro, indicating that they are potential inhibitors of the YycG/YycF two-component system (TCS), which is essential in S. epidermidis. Importantly, all these compounds did not affect the stability of mammalian cells nor hemolytic activities at the concentrations used in our study. CONCLUSION: These novel inhibitors of YycG histidine kinase thus are of potential value as leads for developing new antibiotics against infecting staphylococci. The structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) technology can be widely used in screening potential inhibitors of other bacterial TCSs, since it is more rapid and efficacious than traditional screening technology.","publish_time":"2006-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Qin, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Jian; Xu, Bin; Chen, Lili; Wu, Yang; Yang, Xiaomei; Shen, Xu; Molin, Soeren; Danchin, Antoine; Jiang, Hualiang; Qu, Di","journal":"BMC Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c7d86587837b09a6b722f78beac7bfedaa0333d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1660542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1660542/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["S. epidermidis"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epidermidis growth","screening potential inhibitors","YycG protein","novel inhibitors of YycG histidine kinase","novel antibiotics","YycG HATPase","SBVS","virtual screening","compounds","series of novel inhibitors","Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis","biofilm cells","traditional screening technology","new antibiotics","potential value","conventional antibiotics","staphylococci infections","structure","RESULTS","stability of mammalian cells","surfaces of medical devices","use of implanted medical devices","infecting staphylococci","major frequent cause of infections","relation","YycF","significant activity","HK","small molecular lead-compound library","hemolytic activities","leads","c domain","homolog model","bacterial TCSs","concentrations","biofilms","component system","BACKGROUND","report","bactericidal effects","urgent need","experimental validation","capacity","resistance","CONCLUSION","chronic infection","auto-phosphorylation","study","candidates","pathogenicity"],"language":"en"},

Genome sequencing initiatives of human and model organisms are targeted efforts towards understanding principles of evolution with an application envisaged to improve human health. These efforts culminated in the development of dedicated resources. Whereas a large number of viral genomes have been sequenced by groups or individuals with an interest to study antigenic variation amongst strains and species. These independent efforts enabled viruses to attain the status of \u0027best-represented taxa\u0027 with the highest number of genomes. However, due to lack of concerted efforts, viral genomic sequences merely remained as entries in the public repositories until recently. RESULTS: VirGen is a curated resource of viral genomes and their analyses. Since its first release, it has grown both in terms of coverage of viral families and development of new modules for annotation and analysis. The current release (2.0) includes data for twenty-five families with broad host range as against eight in the first release. The taxonomic description of viruses in VirGen is in accordance with the ICTV nomenclature. A well-characterised strain is identified as a \u0027representative entry\u0027 for every viral species. This non-redundant dataset is used for subsequent annotation and analyses using sequenced-based Bioinformatics approaches. VirGen archives precomputed data on genome and proteome comparisons. A new data module that provides structures of viral proteins available in PDB has been incorporated recently. One of the unique features of VirGen is predicted conformational and sequential epitopes of known antigenic proteins using in-house developed algorithms, a step towards reverse vaccinology. CONCLUSION: Structured organization of genomic data facilitates use of data mining tools, which provides opportunities for knowledge discovery. One of the approaches to achieve this goal is to carry out functional annotations using comparative genomics. VirGen, a comprehensive viral genome resource that serves as an annotation and analysis pipeline has been developed for the curation of public domain viral genome data .

We have developed one such approach based on previously described broad-range reverse transcription PCR/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) technology. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Analysis of base compositions of RT-PCR amplicons from influenza core gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS, NP) are used to provide sub-species identification and infer influenza virus H and N subtypes. Using this approach, we detected and correctly identified 92 mammalian and avian influenza isolates, representing 30 different H and N types, including 29 avian H5N1 isolates. Further, direct analysis of 656 human clinical respiratory specimens collected over a seven-year period (1999\u20132006) showed correct identification of the viral species and subtypes with \u003E97% sensitivity and specificity. Base composition derived clusters inferred from this analysis showed 100% concordance to previously established clades. Ongoing surveillance of samples from the recent influenza virus seasons (2005\u20132006) showed evidence for emergence and establishment of new genotypes of circulating H3N2 strains worldwide. Mixed viral quasispecies were found in approximately 1% of these recent samples providing a view into viral evolution. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, rapid RT-PCR/ESI-MS analysis can be used to simultaneously identify all species of influenza viruses with clade-level resolution, identify mixed viral populations and monitor global spread and emergence of novel viral genotypes.

We describe the development and pilot testing of a systematic, transparent approach used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop rapid advice guidelines in response to requests from member states confronted with uncertainty about the pharmacological management of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. We first searched for systematic reviews of randomized trials of treatment and prevention of seasonal influenza and for non-trial evidence on H5N1 infection, including case reports and animal and in vitro studies. A panel of clinical experts, clinicians with experience in treating patients with H5N1, influenza researchers, and methodologists was convened for a two-day meeting. Panel members reviewed the evidence prior to the meeting and agreed on the process. It took one month to put together a team to prepare the evidence profiles (i.e., summaries of the evidence on important clinical and policy questions), and it took the team only five weeks to prepare and revise the evidence profiles and to prepare draft guidelines prior to the panel meeting. A draft manuscript for publication was prepared within 10 days following the panel meeting.

Although multiple ACE-like proteins exist in non-mammalian organisms, to date only one other ACE homologue, ACE2, has been identified in mammals. RESULTS: Here we report the identification and characterisation of the gene encoding a third homologue of ACE, termed ACE3, in several mammalian genomes. The ACE3 gene is located on the same chromosome downstream of the ACE gene. Multiple sequence alignment and molecular modelling have been employed to characterise the predicted ACE3 protein. In mouse, rat, cow and dog, the predicted protein has mutations in some of the critical residues involved in catalysis, including the catalytic Glu in the HEXXH zinc binding motif which is Gln, and ESTs or reverse-transcription PCR indicate that the gene is expressed. In humans, the predicted ACE3 protein has an intact HEXXH motif, but there are other deletions and insertions in the gene and no ESTs have been identified. CONCLUSION: In the genomes of several mammalian species there is a gene that encodes a novel, single domain ACE-like protein, ACE3. In mouse, rat, cow and dog ACE3, the catalytic Glu is replaced by Gln in the putative zinc binding motif, indicating that in these species ACE3 would lack catalytic activity as a zinc metalloprotease. In humans, no evidence was found that the ACE3 gene is expressed and the presence of deletions and insertions in the sequence indicate that ACE3 is a pseudogene.","publish_time":"2007-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rella, Monika; Elliot, Joann L; Revett, Timothy J; Lanfear, Jerry; Phelan, Anne; Jackson, Richard M; Turner, Anthony J; Hooper, Nigel M","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/deeacb8558e3403c69cd8db9f4e8e5214fd85c46.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1925091.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1925091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ACE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACE3 gene","ACE gene","dog ACE3","species ACE3","predicted ACE3 protein","termed ACE3","ACE homologue","homologue of ACE","multiple ACE","predicted protein","mammalian species","mammalian genomes","single domain ACE","HEXXH zinc binding motif","catalytic Glu","Mammalian angiotensin","putative zinc binding motif","Gln","intact HEXXH motif","catalytic activity","cow","zinc metalloprotease","non-mammalian organisms","ESTs","rat","insertions","mouse","humans","Multiple sequence alignment","presence of deletions","key role","enzyme","mutations","proteins","date","blood pressure regulation","molecular modelling","catalysis","reverse-transcription PCR","novel","critical residues","BACKGROUND","identification","ACE2","evidence","chromosome","characterisation","pseudogene","RESULTS","mammals","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

We used cryo-electron microscopy and image processing to investigate conformational changes that occur in the entire spike of intact virions when they bind to the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We have shown that ACE2 binding results in structural changes that appear to be the initial step in viral membrane fusion, and precisely localized the receptor-binding and fusion core domains within the entire spike. Furthermore, our results show that receptor binding and subsequent membrane fusion are distinct steps, and that each spike can bind up to three ACE2 molecules.

We have shown previously that the topology of the \u03B1-helical putative TM domain of E protein (ETM), flanked by two lysine residues at C and N termini to improve solubility, is consistent with a regular TM \u03B1-helix, with orientational parameters in lipid bilayers that are consistent with a homopentameric model.

Todos los cerdos infectados bien con arreglo al procedimiento combinado buco\u2010nasal (16) o bien a trav\u00E9s del nervio infraorbitario (3) enfermaron tras un tiempo de incubaci\u00F3n de 5 d\u00EDas. Seis de siete animales inoculados a trav\u00E9s de la pared g\u00E1strica, 6 de 8 por v\u00EDa intramuscular y 3 de 5 por v\u00EDa intracerebral enfermaron tras un tiempo de incubaci\u00F3n de 3\u20133,5 d\u00EDas. No se registraron casos de enfermedad en los cerdos inoculados por v\u00EDa intravenosa o en la cavidad abdominal resp. directamente en el est\u00F3mago. Todos los cerdos que enfermaron presentaban el s\u00EDndrome de hipotrepsia y v\u00F3mitos. De los cerdos infectados por v\u00EDa buco\u2010nasal, que se sacrificaron durante el estadio precoz de la enfermedad, se pudo reaislar el virus con regularidad de las tonsilas y del tracto respiratorio y, en ocasiones, del tejido correspondiente al \u00E1mbito puente de Varolio\u2010medula, as\u00ED como de la pared g\u00E1strica. Se logr\u00F3 siempre aislar virus de cerdos que enfermaron tras infecci\u00F3n por otras v\u00EDas. Sin embargo, todos los animales que no enfermaron (excepci\u00F3n hecha por un lech\u00F3n) produjeron anticuerpos. No se logr\u00F3 descubrir el lugar en donde se multiplicaba el virus, hecho relacionado con los v\u00F3mitos. Los resultados de los estudios presentados permiten llegar a la conclusi\u00F3n de que la propagaci\u00F3n del virus en el organismo acontece a trav\u00E9s de las v\u00EDas nerviosas.","publish_time":"2010-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Andries, K.; Pensaert, M.; Callebaut, P.","journal":"J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public

No elevation of TNF\u2010\u03B1 activity was found in hepatic failure complicating paracetamol poisoning. In contrast, TNF\u2010\u03B1 activity significantly increased in response to MHV3, reaching 16.3 \u00B1 5.5 U/ml from 24 h post infection (P\u003E0.01).

In addition, several organ\u2010specific manifestations, including HIV\u2010associated nephropathy, wasting syndrome and cardiomiopathy, are a direct consequence of damage by HIV\u20101, and so HAART may have a therapeutic effect in improving or preventing these manifestations. Finally, the introduction of HAART has seen the emergence of several complications, termed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, which includes OIs such as cytomegalovirus vitritis, Mycobacterium avium complex lymphadenitis, paradoxical responses to treatment for tuberculosis, and exacerbation of cryptococcosis.

The results showed that only LoVo cells were permissive to SARS\u2010CoV infection as evident by positive findings from indirect immunofluorescence staining for intracellular viral antigens, in situ hybridization for intracellular viral RNA, and electron microscopy for intracellular viral particles. In contrast to Vero cells, SARS\u2010CoV did not produce cytopathic effects on LoVo cells. However, LoVo cells were found to be highly permissive for productive infection with a high viral titre (\u003E3 \u00D7 10(7) viral copies/ml) produced in culture supernatant following a few days of incubation.

Two hundred twenty\u2010seven children were enrolled in the study with a diagnosis of asthma, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia, or laringo\u2010tracheo bronchitis. A molecular approach was adopted using specific reverse transcription (RT)\u2010PCR assays detecting 13 respiratory viruses including metapneumovirus (hMPV) and the novel coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1; most amplified fragments were sequenced to confirm positive results and differentiate the strain. Viral pathogens were detected in 97 samples (42.7%), with 4.8% of dual infections identified; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 17.2% of children, followed by rhinovirus (9.7%), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) (7.5%), and influenza type A (4.4%).

DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study, without intervention. METHOD: Patients with respiratory illnesses were evaluated by a directed history and physical examination. Nasopharyngeal secretions for viral culture were obtained, and acute and convalescent serum samples were obtained for analysis. Serologic evidence of infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza were determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and influenza by hemagglutination\u2010inhibition assay and EIA. SETTING: A 591\u2010bed nursing home. PARTICIPANTS: Residents with signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness (nasal congestion, pharyngitis, cough, wheezing, or respiratory difficulty) were eligible for study. RESULTS: A viral etiology was documented in 62 out of 149 illnesses (42%). RSV was the most common virus associated with illness; it was documented in 27% of respiratory illnesses, followed by rhinovirus (9%), parainfluenza (6%), and influenza (1%). RSV was associated with significantly more severe disease when compared with rhinovirus. Clustering of specific viral infections occurred, suggesting nosocomial transmission.

To detect early SARS\u2010CoV infection, a one\u2010step, real\u2010time quantitative reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assay was developed that could simultaneously detect nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and spike (S) genes of SARS\u2010CoV with the same PCR condition using either Applied Biosystems (ABI) Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System or Roche LightCycler. The sensitivity of this assay was evaluated using cell culture\u2010derived viruses, in vitro transcribed viral RNA, and clinical specimens. The SARS\u2010S, \u2010M, and \u2010N primer/probe sets described in this paper could detect one to ten copies of in vitro transcribed S, M, and N RNA per test using both the ABI and Roche assay systems. The relative sensitivities for detecting cell culture\u2010derived SARS\u2010CoV were 0.01, 0.01, and 0.001 PFU/test, respectively. It showed that SARS\u2010N has comparable detection efficiencies to SARS2 and SARS3 which are primers sets designed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, SARS\u2010S and SARS\u2010M also demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to the commercially available RealArt HPA\u2010Coronavirus reagents (Artus). The relative sensitivity of these primer/probe sets was also examined using human sera spiked viruses and clinical specimens from four confirmed SARS patients. Similar results as above were obtained. Specificity tests and sequence alignment showed that these primer/probe sets annealed perfectly to 31 isolates of SARS\u2010CoV; and there was no cross detection with other coronaviruses and human respiratory tract\u2010associated viruses. Therefore, not only is it compatible with the ABI and Roche systems, this multiple\u2010gene detection assay also has the merit of being a rapid, safe, sensitive, and specific tool for accurate diagnosis of SARS\u2010CoV infection.

Nitrogen fixation is a biological process that guarantees that the atmospheric N(2) is incorporated into organic matter by several bacterial groups. Most representatives of this group, also known as diazotrophic, are generally associated with soil rhizosphere of many plants and also establishing a more specific association living inside roots, leaves, and others plants tissues as endophyte. Their roles as plant growth\u2010promoting microorganisms are generally related to increase in plant biomass, phosphate and other mineral solubilization, and plant pathogen control. Here, we report many of these plant growth\u2010promoting processes related to nitrogen fixing species already described in Acetobacteraceae family, especially Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus and their importance to agriculture.

The purpose of the present paper was to carry out a retrospective study of the clinical and demographic data of SARS patients with diarrhea in Princess Margaret Hospital. Methods: From 1 to 31 March 2003, hospital records from 240 patients with confirmed SARS were studied. Patients with watery stool of \u22653 times/day for at least 3 consecutive days were defined as the diarrhea group. Clinical and demographic data were compared between the diarrhea and non\u2010diarrhea groups. Chest X\u2010ray (CXR) scores during the peak of diarrhea period were recorded by a respiratory physician. These CXR scores were correlated with the peak frequency of diarrhea by Spearman\u0027s correlation coefficient. Results: Diarrhea occurred in 20.4% of patients after admission. Female patients were predominant with a female to male ratio of 6:1 (P \u003C 0.001) and 69.4% of patients were living in Amoy Gardens Estate (P = 0.01). The proportions of patients requiring ventilatory care and mortality in the diarrhea group were 8.2% and 2%, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the non\u2010diarrhea group (27.6% and 16.2%, P \u003C 0.005).

The functional abilities of a species, such as its plasticity in various environments, can determine its distribution, species richness and beta diversity patterns. In this study, we evaluate how functional traits influence the distribution of amphibians, and hypothesize which functional traits explain the current pattern of amphibian species composition. LOCATION: Atlantic Forest, Brazil. TAXON: Amphibia (Anura and Gymnophiona) METHODS: Using potential distributions of Brazilian amphibians from Atlantic Forest based on their functional traits, we analysed the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on species richness, endemism (with permutation multivariate analysis) and beta diversity components (i.e. total, turnover and nestedness dissimilarities). RESULTS: Environmental variables explained 59.5% of species richness, whereas functional traits explained 15.8% of species distribution (geographical species range) for Anuran and 88.8% for Gymnophiona. Body size had the strongest correlation with species distribution. Results showed that species with medium to large body size, and species that are adapted to living in open areas tended to disperse from west to east direction. Current forest changes directly affected beta diversity patterns (i.e. most species adapted to novel environments increase their ranges). Beta diversity partitioning between humid and dry forests showed decreased nestedness and increased turnover by increasing altitude in the south\u2010eastern region of the Atlantic Forest. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that functional traits directly influence the ability of the species to disperse. With the alterations of the natural environment, species more apt to these alterations have dispersed or increased their distribution, which consequently changes community structure. As a result, there are nested species distribution patterns and homogenization of amphibian species composition throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.","publish_time":"2019-10-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Louren\u00E7o\u2010de\u2010Moraes, Ricardo; Campos, Felipe S.; Ferreira, Rodrigo B.; Beard, Karen H.; Sol\u00E9, Mirco; Llorente, Gustavo A.; Bastos, Rog\u00E9rio P.","journal":"J Biogeogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2818a825f65d4a352e8acba4a89064270602a10.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5a7d8cbdd81a5e2cb303e942d176b87e3eef532d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166796.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil","Atlantic Forest"],"keyphrases":["species richness","Species distributions","nested species distribution patterns","geographical species range","functional traits","homogenization of amphibian species composition","current pattern of amphibian species composition","distribution of amphibians","beta diversity patterns","Brazilian Atlantic Forest","functional abilities","beta diversity components","Beta diversity partitioning","Current forest changes","increased turnover","Gymnophiona","alterations","study","influence of biotic","RESULTS","potential distributions of Brazilian amphibians","large body size","decreased nestedness","nestedness dissimilarities","various environments","novel environments","dry forests","endemism","permutation multivariate analysis","METHODS","abiotic factors","altitude","strongest correlation","south\u2010eastern region","west","communities","natural environment","Anuran","Environmental variables","TAXON","plasticity","LOCATION","ability","important ways","MAIN CONCLUSIONS","open areas","east direction","macroecological relationships","ranges","community structure","AIM"],"language":"en"},

This study concentrated on the first 30 min of infection. It was discovered that the SARS coronavirus attached, entered, and uncoated the nucleocapsids, all within a 30\u2010min period. At 5 min after infection, several virus particles lined the Vero cell plasma membrane. Virus particles were at various stages of fusion at the cell surface, since entry was not a synchronised process. After entry (10 and 15 min), spherical core particles moved into the cytoplasm within large vacuoles. Quite surprising at such early stages of infection (20 min), a virus\u2010induced change in the infected cells was evident. The induction of myelin\u2010like membrane whorls was obvious within the same vacuoles as the core particles. The significance of this virus\u2010induced change is unknown at this stage. By 25\u201330 min postinfection (p.i.), the spherical core particles appeared to be disassociating and, in their place, doughnut\u2010shaped electron\u2010dense structures were observed. These could be the virus genomes together with the helical nucleocapsids. They were no longer in large vacuoles but packaged into smaller vacuoles in the cytoplasm, and occasionally in small groups.

Two cohorts of children (N = 329 and 611) were followed from 2 to 24 months of age in Finland in two prospective studies (Finnish Otitis Media Cohort Study and Finnish Otitis Media Vaccine Trial). During the study period, nasopharyngeal and middle ear fluid specimens for each acute otitis media event were examined for eight (Cohort Study) or ten (Vaccine Trial) common respiratory viruses; adenoviruses, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses, parechoviruses, and rhinoviruses. Picornaviruses (rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and parechoviruses) were determined by reverse transcription PCR while antigen detection was used for the other viruses. A virus was present in either nasopharyngeal or middle ear specimen in 54% of events in the first cohort and in 67% of events in the second. Rhinoviruses formed the most common virus group detected (41\u201332%), followed by enteroviruses (25%, sought in the second cohort only) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (10%). All the other viruses represented jointly 8\u201310% of the events.

This report describes the frequency and clinical presentation of HBoV in 261 Iranian children\u003C5 years old with acute respiratory infections attending two regional hospitals in Rasht, Iran in the winter of 2003\u20132004. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR (RT\u2010PCR) were used for the detection of HBoV and other respiratory pathogens from nasopharyngeal specimens. HBoV was detected in 21 (8%) children. Fifteen (12%) of these children were identified among 122 children admitted to hospital and 6 (4%) from 139 outpatients (P \u003C 0.05). Most children with HBoV were less than 2 years (17/21, 81%) and 7 (33%) were less than 1 year old. Although HBoV was identified in all ages it affected slightly older children than the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The frequency of the virus varied from 1 (3%) in 40 patients in November to 7 (12%) of 61 in February, suggesting a seasonal pattern during the autumn and early winter. Seven children had co\u2010infections with RSV, adenovirus or influenza A. The relatively high frequency of HBoV suggests that the virus may contribute substantially to acute respiratory infections in children. J. Med.

MHV strains A59 and JHMV both cause acute and chronic encephalomyelitis and demyelination in susceptible strains of mice and rats. In acute disease, CNS damage is most likely the result of lytic infection in neurons and oligodendrocytes, and death can be prevented by the adoptive transfer of Class I\u2010restricted CD8\u002B T cells. However, in later stages of the disease induced by some MHV strains, virus tends to be restricted to astrocytes in a nonlytic infection, and the immune response appears to contribute to CNS damage. These data lead us to suggest that the astrocyte may play a central role in the neuropathogenesis of MHV infection. Consistent with this possibility, A59 has been reported to induce the expression of Class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in glial cells following infection in vivo and in vitro. In this communication, we have examined the influence of persistent infection by both A59 and JHMV on MHC Class I expression in primary murine astrocytes. Persistence was characterized by the presence of intracellular viral antigen and mRNA in the absence of detectable infectious virus particles. Under these conditions, JHMV, but not A59, inhibited constitutive expression of the H\u20102 K(b) molecule, with the magnitude of inhibition increasing with postinfection time. A59 was not able to induce Class I during persistence, presumably due to the lack of infectious virus particles. Class I expression was restored by the addition of gamma\u2010interferon (IFN\u2010\u03B3) to astrocytes persistently infected with either A59 or JHMV. Thus, Class I inhibition is not a permanent consequence of JHMV persistence, and persistence does not interfere with normal signalling pathways for Class I induction. \u00A9 1995 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.","publish_time":"2004-10-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Correale, J.; Li, S.; Weiner, L.

The protein sequence of the chymotrypsin\u2010like cysteine proteinase (CCP) responsible for SARS viral replication has been identified as a target for developing anti\u2010SARS drugs. Here, I report the ATVRLQ(p1)A(p1\u0027)\u2010bound CCP 3D model predicted by 420 different molecular dynamics simulations (2.0 ns for each simulation with a 1.0\u2010fs time step). This theoretical model was released at the Protein Data Bank (PDB; code: 1P76) before the release of the first X\u2010ray structure of CCP (PDB code: 1Q2W). In contrast to the catalytic dyad observed in X\u2010ray structures of CCP and other coronavirus cysteine proteinases, a catalytic triad comprising Asp187, His41, and Cys145 is found in the theoretical model of the substrate\u2010bound CCP. The simulations of the CCP complex suggest that substrate binding leads to the displacement of a water molecule entrapped by Asp187 and His41, thus converting the dyad to a more efficient catalytic triad. The CCP complex structure has an expanded active\u2010site pocket that is useful for anti\u2010SARS drug design.

There is a growing body of evidence that suggests there is an association between upper respiratory viral infections, particularly rhinovirus infections, and asthma exacerbations. Virally induced airways hyperreactivity has been associated with elevated numbers of inflammatory cells in the bronchial mucosa. Upon virus infection, respiratory epithelial cells produce proinflammatory cytokines, including IL\u20106, IL\u20108, RANTES, and GM\u2010CSF, which could contribute to the increased inflammatory cell recruitment noted in the airways. Whether or not a viral infection triggers an asthma attack may depend upon many factors, including the types of inflammatory cells recruited to the airways, the viral load, and variations in the host antiviral response. There is evidence to support the idea that eosinophils from asthmatic and symptomatic atopic subjects may be primed to respond to chemotactic cytokines produced by infected epithelial cells. Rhinovirus infections may therefore enhance airway eosinophilia in asthmatics, leading to airway hyperresponsiveness and impaired pulmonary function. Nitric oxide is a potent inhibitor of both rhinovirus\u2010induced cytokine production and viral replication and may play an important role in the host response to viral infections. Based upon these observations, we speculate that nitric oxide donors may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of rhinovirus infections and viral exacerbations of asthma.","publish_time":"2003-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"SANDERS, SCHERER P.","journal":"Proc Soc Exp Biol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97a00a0c464b11f33148ffba3f2c23a765d5dfba.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167740/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs0NDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Virally"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral exacerbations of asthma","upper respiratory viral infections","viral replication","viral load","treatment of rhinovirus infections","types of inflammatory cells","asthma exacerbations","respiratory epithelial cells","elevated numbers of inflammatory cells","asthma attack","infected epithelial cells","induced airways hyperreactivity","chronic inflammatory disease","host response","increased inflammatory cell recruitment","nitric oxide donors","host antiviral response","airway hyperresponsiveness","airway eosinophilia","proinflammatory cytokines","chemotactic cytokines","induced cytokine production","growing body of evidence","eosinophils","novel therapeutic approach","potent inhibitor","mortality","variations","important role","association","symptomatic atopic subjects","worldwide increase","idea","impaired pulmonary function","morbidity","asthmatics","factors","bronchial mucosa","RANTES","GM","CSF","decades","observations"],"language":"en"},

We reevaluated 81 children who had been prospectively followed up since hospitalization for wheezing at less than 2 years of age. The baseline data on characteristics of the children, family\u2010related factors, and viral causes of wheezing were collected on entry into the study. At the median age of 12.3 years, current symptoms suggestive of asthma and allergy were recorded. As part of the clinical examination, an outdoor exercise challenge test and skin prick tests to common inhalant allergens were performed. Asthma, as indicated by current inhaled anti\u2010inflammatory medication or repeated wheezing and positive result in the challenge test, was present in 32 (40%) children, and 90% of them were sensitized to at least one allergen. Early asthma\u2010predictive factors were atopic dermatitis (odds ratio (OR), 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2\u201310.1) and the presence of specific IgE to inhalant allergens (OR, 11.3; 95% CI, 1.9\u201367.6). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) identification during wheezing in infancy was relatively rare (20%) among later asthmatics compared with other or no viral identification (52%) or rhinovirus identification (58%). Since the prevalence of childhood asthma in our area is 4.0\u20135.0%, we conclude that the increased risk of asthma persists until the teenage years after hospitalization for wheezing in infancy. The risk was about 5\u2010fold after respiratory syncytial virus\u2010induced wheezing, and more than 10\u2010fold after rhinovirus\u2010induced wheezing in the present study.

Pulmonary involvement is the dominant clinical feature but extra\u2010pulmonary manifestations are also common. Factors that account for the wide spectrum of organ system involvement and disease severity are poorly understood and the pathogenesis of SARS\u2010CoV infection remains unclear. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has recently been identified as the functional cellular receptor for SARS\u2010CoV. Studies of the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS\u2010CoV, and ACE2 protein expression, reveal new insights into the pathogenesis of this deadly disease. ACE2 is expressed at high level in the primary target cells of SARS\u2010CoV, namely pneumocytes and surface enterocytes of the small intestine. Despite the fact that SARS\u2010CoV can infect the lung and intestine, the tissue responses in these two organs are different. All other tissues and cell types expressing ACE2 may be potential targets of SARS\u2010CoV infection. Remarkably, endothelial cells, which express ACE2 to a high level, have not been shown to be infected by SARS\u2010CoV. There is also evidence that cell types without detectable ACE2 expression may also be infected by the virus. Furthermore, studies in a new human cell culture model have indicated that the presence of ACE2 alone is not sufficient for maintaining viral infection. Therefore, other virus receptors or co\u2010receptors may be required in different tissues. Moreover, the interaction between SARS\u2010CoV and the immunological or lymphoid system remains to be defined. It is clear that we are only at the dawn of our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS. As our knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms improves, a more rational approach to therapeutic and vaccine development can be designed in order to combat this new and fatal human disease.

Phylogenetic analysis of 144 HRV-positive samples showed no apparent correlation between a given viral genotype or species and their ability to invade the lower respiratory tract or lead to protracted infection. By contrast, protracted infections were found almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, thus suggesting that host factors rather than the virus genotype modulate disease outcome, in particular the immune response. Complete genome sequencing of five chronic cases to study rhinovirus genome adaptation showed that the calculated mutation frequency was in the range observed during acute human infections. Analysis of mutation hot spot regions between specimens collected at different times or in different body sites revealed that non-synonymous changes were mostly concentrated in the viral capsid genes VP1, VP2 and VP3, independent of the HRV type. In an immunosuppressed lung transplant recipient infected with the same HRV strain for more than two years, both classical and ultra-deep sequencing of samples collected at different time points in the upper and lower respiratory tracts showed that these virus populations were phylogenetically indistinguishable over the course of infection, except for the last month. Specific signatures were found in the last two lower respiratory tract populations, including changes in the 5\u2032UTR polypyrimidine tract and the VP2 immunogenic site 2. These results highlight for the first time the ability of a given rhinovirus to evolve in the course of a natural infection in immunocompromised patients and complement data obtained from previous experimental inoculation studies in immunocompetent volunteers.","publish_time":"2011-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tapparel, Caroline; Cordey, Samuel; Junier, Thomas; Farinelli, Laurent; Van Belle, Sandra; Soccal, Paola M.; Aubert, John-David; Zdobnov, Evgeny; Kaiser, Laurent","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7835feab0d31096fada1a14d10d67acc080a7d82.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3119694.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3119694/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzIx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower respiratory tracts","respiratory virus infections","lower respiratory tract populations","immunocompromised patients","HRV strain","virus genotype","virus populations","given rhinovirus","human rhinovirus","course of infection","HRV type","protracted infections","HRV-positive samples","different times","different time points","hospital patients","given viral genotype","ability","immunocompromised hosts","natural infection","acute human infections","study rhinovirus genome adaptation","different body sites","Complete genome sequencing","UTR polypyrimidine tract","ultra-deep sequencing of samples","immunosuppressed lung transplant recipient","Phylogenetic analysis","Routine screening of lung transplant recipients","Analysis of mutation hot spot regions","non-synonymous changes","calculated mutation frequency","VP2 immunogenic site","viral capsid genes VP1","chronic cases","VP3","data","apparent correlation","previous experimental inoculation studies","specimens","range","disease outcome","immunocompetent volunteers","years","lead","host factors","species","immune response","weeks","months","contrast","Specific signatures","results"],"language":"en"},

To provide a framework for strengthening disease surveillance and response capacities in African countries, the World Health Organization Regional Headquarters for Africa (AFRO) developed Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) aimed at improving national surveillance and laboratory systems. IDSR emphasizes the linkage of information provided by public health laboratories to the selection of relevant, appropriate and effective public health responses to disease outbreaks. METHODS: We reviewed the development of Rwanda\u0027s National Reference Laboratory (NRL) to understand essential structures involved in creating a national public health laboratory network. We reviewed documents describing the NRL\u0027s organization and record of test results, conducted site visits, and interviewed health staff in the Ministry of Health and in partner agencies. Findings were developed by organizing thematic categories and grouping examples within them. We purposefully sought to identify success factors as well as challenges inherent in developing a national public health laboratory system. RESULTS: Among the identified success factors were: a structured governing framework for public health surveillance; political commitment to promote leadership for stronger laboratory capacities in Rwanda; defined roles and responsibilities for each level; coordinated approaches between technical and funding partners; collaboration with external laboratories; and use of performance results in advocacy with national stakeholders. Major challenges involved general infrastructure, human resources, and budgetary constraints.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring infectious diseases and may be among the first to contract emerging infections. This study aims to explore European HCWs\u0027 perceptions and attitudes towards monitoring their absence and symptom reports for surveillance of newly circulating infections. METHODS: A qualitative study with thematic analysis was conducted using focus group methodology. Forty-nine hospital-based HCWs from 12 hospitals were recruited to six focus groups; two each in England and Hungary and one each in Germany and Greece. RESULTS: HCWs perceived risk factors for occupationally acquired infectious diseases to be 1.) exposure to patients with undiagnosed infections 2.) break-down in infection control procedures 3.) immuno-na\u00EFvety and 4.) symptomatic colleagues. They were concerned that a lack of monitoring and guidelines for infectious HCWs posed a risk to staff and patients and felt employers failed to take a positive interest in their health. Staffing demands and loss of income were noted as pressures to attend work when unwell. In the UK, Hungary and Greece participants felt monitoring staff absence and the routine disclosure of symptoms could be appropriate provided the effectiveness and efficiency of such a system were demonstrable. In Germany, legislation, privacy and confidentiality were identified as barriers. All HCWs highlighted the need for knowledge and structural improvements for timelier recognition of emerging infections. These included increased suspicion and awareness among staff and standardised, homogenous absence reporting systems. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring absence and infectious disease symptom reports among HCWs may be a feasible means of surveillance for emerging infections in some settings. A pre-requisite will be tackling the drivers for symptomatic HCWs to attend work.","publish_time":"2011-07-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aghaizu, Adamma; Elam, Gillian; Ncube, Fortune; Thomson, Gail; Szil\u00E1gyi, Emese; Eckmanns, Tim; Poulakou, Garyphallia; Catchpole, Mike","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc5bd8ae2cac9621202c04c1ec25699f5b7c3a91.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3160373.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3160373/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzU50","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Healthcare"],"locations":["England","Hungary","Greece","Germany"],"keyphrases":["infectious HCWs","symptomatic HCWs","European HCWs","Monitoring absence","circulating infections","monitoring staff absence","undiagnosed infections","hospital-based HCWs","HCWs perceived risk factors","infectious diseases","timelier recognition of emerging infections","lack of monitoring","infectious disease symptom reports","high risk","Hospitals","Hungary","patients","Germany","homogenous absence reporting systems","Greece participants","focus groups","qualitative study","symptomatic colleagues","feasible means of surveillance","focus group methodology","structural improvements","thematic analysis","knowledge","routine disclosure of symptoms","awareness","drivers","attitudes","guidelines","efficiency","effectiveness","pressures","privacy","confidentiality","need","RESULTS","epicentres","perceptions","CONCLUSIONS","increased suspicion","break","infection control procedures","loss of income","legislation","METHODS","England","UK","employers","exposure","settings","Healthcare workers","Staffing","pre-requisite","barriers","BACKGROUND","immuno-na\u00EFvety"],"language":"en"},

In addition, most previous studies documented vital parameters and lung mechanics only incompletely. The aim of the present study was to establish experimental conditions that keep these parameters within their physiological range over a period of 6 h. For this purpose, we also examined the effects of frequent short recruitment manoeuvres (RM) in healthy mice. METHODS: Mice were ventilated at low tidal volume V(T) = 8 mL/kg or high tidal volume V(T) = 16 mL/kg and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2 or 6 cmH(2)O. RM were performed every 5 min, 60 min or not at all. Lung mechanics were followed by the forced oscillation technique. Blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG), heart frequency (HF), oxygen saturation and body temperature were monitored. Blood gases, neutrophil-recruitment, microvascular permeability and pro-inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood serum as well as histopathology of the lung were examined. RESULTS: MV with repetitive RM every 5 min resulted in stable respiratory mechanics. Ventilation without RM worsened lung mechanics due to alveolar collapse, leading to impaired gas exchange. HF and BP were affected by anaesthesia, but not by ventilation. Microvascular permeability was highest in atelectatic lungs, whereas neutrophil-recruitment and structural changes were strongest in lungs ventilated with high tidal volume. The cytokines IL-6 and KC, but neither TNF nor IP-10, were elevated in the BAL and serum of all ventilated mice and were reduced by recurrent RM. Lung mechanics, oxygenation and pulmonary inflammation were improved by increased PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent RM maintain lung mechanics in their physiological range during low tidal volume ventilation of healthy mice by preventing atelectasis and reduce the development of pulmonary inflammation.","publish_time":"2011-09-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reiss, Lucy Kathleen; Kowallik, Anke; Uhlig, Stefan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/690ab99a21dca381b585a6a7d32f1e5c01f1e52c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3174196.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3174196/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozc00","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BP","TNF","BAL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RM worsened lung mechanics","ventilated mice","stable ventilation of mice","low tidal volume ventilation of healthy mice","Recurrent RM","high tidal volume V","Mechanical ventilation","repetitive RM","stable respiratory mechanics","neutrophil-recruitment","Blood pressure","blood serum","microvascular permeability","physiological range","BAL","HF","experimental conditions","experimental studies","Blood gases","MV","BP","development of pulmonary inflammation","atelectatic lungs","vital parameters","previous studies","cytokines IL","increased PEEP","effects of frequent short recruitment manoeuvres","pro-inflammatory cytokines","positive end-expiratory pressure","bronchoalveolar lavage","alveolar collapse","electrocardiogram","oxygen saturation","heart frequency","ECG","structural changes","atelectasis","oxygenation","KC","present study","impaired gas exchange","CONCLUSIONS","body temperature","addition","period","forced oscillation technique","RESULTS","INTRODUCTION","anaesthesia","histopathology","hours","TNF","IP","purpose","aim","cmH","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

One hypothesis for the etiology of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions is that a concurrent inflammatory stress results in decreased threshold for drug toxicity. To explore this hypothesis in an animal model, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with nonhepatotoxic doses of AMD or its vehicle and with saline vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce low-level inflammation. Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities as well as increased total bile acid concentrations in serum and midzonal hepatocellular necrosis were observed only in AMD/LPS-cotreated rats.

The increase in ALT activity in AMD/LPS cotreatment showed a clear dose-response relationship with AMD as well as LPS. The metabolism and hepatic accumulation of AMD were not affected by LPS coexposure. Serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) was significantly increased by LPS and was slightly prolonged by AMD. In Hepac1c7 cells, addition of TNF potentiated the cytotoxicity of both AMD and its primary metabolite, mono-N-desethylamiodarone. In vivo inhibition of TNF signaling by etanercept attenuated the AMD/LPS-induced liver injury in rats. In summary, AMD treatment during modest inflammation induced severe hepatotoxicity in rats, and TNF contributed to the induction of liver injury in this animal model of idiosyncratic AMD-induced liver injury.","publish_time":"2011-10-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Jingtao; Jones, A.

It is the most geographically widespread parasite causing human malaria, with around 2.85 billion people living under risk of infection. The Brazilian Amazon region reports more than 50% of the malaria cases in Latin America and since 1990 there is a marked predominance of this species, responsible for 85% of cases in 2009. However, only a few complicated cases of P. vivax have been reported from this region. A systematic review of the Brazilian indexed and non-indexed literature on complicated cases of vivax malaria was performed including published articles, masters\u0027 dissertations, doctoral theses and national congresses\u0027 abstracts. The following information was retrieved: patient characteristics (demographic, presence of co-morbidities and, whenever possible, associated genetic disorders); description of each major clinical manifestation. As a result, 27 articles, 28 abstracts from scientific events\u0027 annals and 13 theses/dissertations were found, only after 1987. Most of the reported information was described in small case series and case reports of patients from all the Amazonian states, and also in travellers from Brazilian non-endemic areas. The more relevant clinical complications were anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, jaundice and acute respiratory distress syndrome, present in all age groups, in addition to other more rare clinical pictures. Complications in pregnant women were also reported. Acute and chronic co-morbidities were frequent, however death was occasional. Clinical atypical cases of malaria are more frequent than published in the indexed literature, probably due to a publication bias. In the Brazilian Amazon (considered to be a low to moderate intensity area of transmission), clinical data are in accordance with the recent findings of severity described in diverse P. vivax endemic areas (especially anaemia in Southeast Asia), however in this region both children and adults are affected. Finally, gaps of knowledge and areas for future research are opportunely pointed out.","publish_time":"2012-01-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lacerda, Marcus VG; Mour\u00E3o, Maria PG; Alexandre, M\u00E1rcia AA; Siqueira, Andr\u00E9 M; Magalh\u00E3es, Belisa ML; Martinez-Espinosa, Flor E; Santana Filho, Franklin S; Brasil, Patr\u00EDcia; Ventura, Ana MRS; Tada, Mauro S; Couto, Vanja SCD; Silva, Ant\u00F4nio R; Silva, Rita SU; Alecrim, Maria GC","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16924e33ce20f1a51ad925c2f1bf6ad6dce8cbbc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3268102.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3268102/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE5Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Latin America","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["malaria cases","complicated cases of vivax malaria","Clinical atypical cases of malaria","vivax endemic areas","human malaria","clinical data","Brazilian Amazon region","Brazilian non-endemic areas","major clinical manifestation","relevant clinical complications","reported information","non-indexed literature","malaria eradication agenda","Plasmodium vivax infection","rare clinical pictures","anaemia","case reports of patients","published articles","presence of co-morbidities","chronic co-morbidities","increasing number of severe manifestation reports","doctoral theses","masters\u0027 dissertations","following information","risk of infection","small case series","national congresses\u0027 abstracts","acute respiratory distress syndrome","thrombocytopaenia","jaundice","travellers","patient characteristics","moderate intensity area of transmission","scientific events\u0027 annals","recent findings of severity","demographic","addition","accordance","description","age groups","death","Southeast Asia","genetic disorders","Amazonian states","gaps of knowledge","future research","systematic review","marked predominance","species","widespread parasite","resurgence","people","Latin America","pregnant women","children","adults","result","publication bias"],"language":"en"},

Many viruses integrate their sequences into the genome of their host for replication. These processes may lead to the virus acquisition of host sequences. Such sequences are prone to accumulation of mutations and deletions. However, in rare instances, sequences acquired from a host become beneficial for the virus. We searched for unexpected sequence similarity among the 900,000 viral proteins and all proteins from cellular organisms. Here, we focus on viruses that infect metazoa. The high-conservation analysis yielded 187 instances of highly similar viral-host sequences. Only a small number of them represent viruses that hijacked host sequences. The low-conservation sequence analysis utilizes the Pfam family collection. About 5% of the 12,000 statistical models archived in Pfam are composed of viral-metazoan proteins. In about half of Pfam families, we provide indirect support for the directionality from the host to the virus. The other families are either wrongly annotated or reflect an extensive sequence exchange between the viruses and their hosts. In about 75% of cross-taxa Pfam families, the viral proteins are significantly shorter than their metazoan counterparts. The tendency for shorter viral proteins relative to their related host proteins accounts for the acquisition of only a fragment of the host gene, the elimination of an internal domain and shortening of the linkers between domains. We conclude that, along viral evolution, the host-originated sequences accommodate simplified domain compositions. We postulate that the trimmed proteins act by interfering with the fundamental function of the host including intracellular signaling, post-translational modification, protein-protein interaction networks and cellular trafficking. We compiled a collection of hijacked protein sequences. These sequences are attractive targets for manipulation of viral infection.","publish_time":"2012-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rappoport, Nadav; Linial, Michal","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/df0fec846e0a329190f5f8babcb5ecf535141338.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3271019.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3271019/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["similar viral-host sequences","host-originated sequences","virus acquisition of host sequences","host gene","viral-metazoan proteins","related host proteins accounts","shorter viral proteins relative","viral evolution","collection of hijacked protein sequences","manipulation of viral infection","trimmed proteins act","half of Pfam families","infection cycle of viruses","Pfam family collection","cross-taxa Pfam families","protein-protein interaction networks","low-conservation sequence analysis","extensive sequence exchange","high-conservation analysis","unexpected sequence similarity","cellular trafficking","internal domain","cellular organisms","rare instances","metazoan counterparts","simplified domain compositions","exchange of genetic material","post-translational modification","opportunities","attractive targets","fundamental function","indirect support","accumulation of mutations","elimination","directionality","tendency","genome","deletions","linkers","fragment","statistical models","small number","processes","replication","hosts","domains"],"language":"en"},

We mined the Dispanins in 36 eukaryotic species, covering all major eukaryotic groups, and investigated their evolutionary history using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches to infer a phylogenetic tree. We identified ten human genes that together with the known IFITM genes form the Dispanin family. We show that the Dispanins first emerged in eukaryotes in a common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoa, and that the family later expanded in vertebrates where it forms four subfamilies (A\u2013D). Interestingly, we also find that the family is found in several different phyla of bacteria and propose that it was horizontally transferred to eukaryotes from bacteria in the common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoa.

However, the genome-wide changes in response to influenza infection in AM have not been defined. We performed gene profiling of human AM in response to H1N1 influenza A virus PR/8 using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chips and verified the changes at both mRNA and protein levels by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. We confirmed the response with a contemporary H3N2 influenza virus A/New York/238/2005 (NY/238). To understand the local cellular response, we also evaluated the impact of paracrine factors on virus-induced chemokine and cytokine secretion. In addition, we investigated the changes in the expression of macrophage receptors and uptake of pathogens after PR/8 infection. Although macrophages fail to release a large amount of infectious virus, we observed a robust induction of type I and type III interferons and several cytokines and chemokines following influenza infection. CXCL9, 10, and 11 were the most highly induced chemokines by influenza infection. UV-inactivation abolished virus-induced cytokine and chemokine response, with the exception of CXCL10. The contemporary influenza virus NY/238 infection of AM induced a similar response as PR/8. Inhibition of TNF and/or IL-1\u03B2 activity significantly decreased the secretion of the proinflammatory chemokines CCL5 and CXCL8 by over 50%. PR/8 infection also significantly decreased mRNA levels of macrophage receptors including C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A), macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1), and CD36, and reduced uptake of zymosan. In conclusion, influenza infection induced an extensive proinflammatory response in human AM.

Although our final molecular diagnostic platform was ultimately selected on the basis of operational and strategic considerations determined by the specific context of PERCH, our review highlighted several conceptual and practical challenges in respiratory diagnostics that have broader relevance for the performance and interpretation of pneumonia research studies.","publish_time":"2012-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhat, Niranjan; O\u0027Brien, Katherine L.; Karron, Ruth A.; Driscoll, Amanda J.; Murdoch, David R.","journal":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d83f751c542a1f85ba6c4543824c2b261329521e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3297547.xml.json","url":"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/54/suppl_2/S153/20938419/cir1060.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI2Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interpretation of pneumonia research studies","specific context of PERCH","comprehensive review","development stage of PERCH","unique requirements of PERCH","interpretation of diagnostic evaluation studies","current state of respiratory diagnostics","Pneumonia Etiology Research","Comprehensive microbiological testing","field of respiratory infections","practical challenges","critical challenges","final molecular diagnostic platform","molecular methods","testing strategy","core function","general design","Child Health","performance","broader relevance","strategic considerations","time","basis of operational","resources necessary","short list of candidate platforms","project","process","efforts"],"language":"en"},

Molecular understanding of the underlying mechanisms is not complete. Airway epithelial ion transport regulates the homeostasis of airway surface liquid, essential for airway mucosal immunity and lung host defense. Here, air-liquid interface cultures of Calu-3 epithelial cells were basolaterally exposed to physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol (0, 25, 50 and 100 mM) for 24 hours and adenosine-stimulated ion transport was measured by Ussing chamber. The ethanol exposure reduced the epithelial short-circuit currents (I(SC)) in a dose-dependent manner. The ion currents activated by adenosine were chloride conductance mediated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel. Alloxazine, a specific inhibitor for A(2B) adenosine receptor (A(2B)AR), largely abolished the adenosine-stimulated chloride transport, suggesting that A(2B)AR is a major receptor responsible for regulating the chloride transport of the cells. Ethanol significantly reduced intracellular cAMP production upon adenosine stimulation. Moreover, ethanol-suppression of the chloride secretion was able to be restored by cAMP analogs or by inhibitors to block cAMP degradation. These results imply that ethanol exposure dysregulates CFTR-mediated chloride transport in airways by suppression of adenosine-A(2B)AR-cAMP signaling pathway, which might contribute to alcohol-associated lung infections.","publish_time":"2012-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raju, Sammeta V.; Wang, Guoshun","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b85671451a6132068f92e5da9590cbc9ee5867d5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3307712.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3307712/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Alloxazine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adenosine-stimulated chloride transport","chloride conductance","adenosine-stimulated ion transport","suppression of adenosine","adenosine receptor","AR-cAMP","CFTR-mediated chloride transport","Airway epithelial ion transport","chloride secretion","adenosine stimulation","cAMP-activated chloride channel","ethanol-suppression","ethanol exposure","cAMP analogs","cAMP degradation","ion currents","epithelial cells","intracellular cAMP production","relevant concentrations of ethanol","alcohol-associated lung infections","increased lung infections","homeostasis of airway surface liquid","airway mucosal immunity","lung host defense","Alcohol abuse","major receptor responsible","cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator","air-liquid interface cultures of Calu","airways","underlying mechanisms","inhibitors","pathway","hours","Ussing chamber","Molecular understanding","specific inhibitor","SC","results","dose-dependent manner","Alloxazine"],"language":"en"},

HNPs are tridisulfide-linked antimicrobial peptides involved in the intracellular killing of organisms phagocytosed by neutrophils. The peptides are produced as inactive precursors (proHNPs) which are processed to active microbicides by as yet unidentified convertases. ProHNP1 was expressed in E. coli and the affinity-purified propeptide isolated as two species, one containing mature HNP1 sequence with native disulfide linkages (\u201Cfolded proHNP1\u201D) and the other containing non-native disulfide linked proHNP1 conformers (misfolded proHNP1). Native HNP1, liberated by CNBr treatment of folded proHNP1, was microbicidal against Staphylococcus aureus, but the peptide derived from misfolded proHNP1 was inactive. We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3) or cathepsin G (CG), serine proteases that co-localize with HNPs in azurophil granules, are proHNP1 activating convertases. Folded proHNP1 was converted to mature HNP1 by both NE and PR3, but CG generated an HNP1 variant with an N-terminal dipeptide extension. NE and PR3 cleaved folded proHNP1 to produce a peptide indistinguishable from native HNP1 purified from neutrophils, and the microbicidal activities of in vitro derived and natural HNP1 peptides were equivalent. In contrast, misfolded proHNP1 conformers were degraded extensively under the same conditions. Thus, NE and PR3 possess proHNP1 convertase activity that requires the presence of the native HNP1 disulfide motif for high fidelity activation of the precursor in vitro.","publish_time":"2012-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tongaonkar, Prasad; Golji, Amir E.; Tran, Patti; Ouellette, Andr\u00E9 J.; Selsted, Michael E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af2a0da4beb166ca0b189ee6282120c9b664ea79.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3308943.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3308943/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["misfolded proHNP1 conformers","proHNP1 convertase activity","CNBr treatment of folded proHNP1","HNP1 variant","natural HNP1 peptides","PR3","native HNP1 disulfide motif","mature HNP1 sequence","native disulfide linkages","human neutrophil peptides","antimicrobial peptides","CG","containing non-native disulfide","azurophilic granules of human neutrophils","peptide indistinguishable","microbicidal activities of","azurophil granules","neutrophil elastase","unidentified convertases","inactive precursors","\u03B1-defensins","presence","high fidelity activation","serine proteases","cathepsin G","proteinase","Staphylococcus aureus","intracellular killing of organisms","N-terminal dipeptide extension","species","active microbicides","propeptide","proHNPs","coli","tridisulfide","contrast","affinity","conditions"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies showed that XMRV is a recombinant mouse retrovirus; hence, its association with human diseases has become questionable. Here, we demonstrated that XMRV envelope (Env)-mediated pseudoviral infection is not blocked by lysosomotropic agents and cellular protease inhibitors, suggesting that XMRV entry is not pH-dependent. The full length XMRV Env was unable to induce syncytia formation and cell-cell fusion, even in cells overexpressing the viral receptor, XPR1. However, truncation of the C-terminal 21 or 33 amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of XMRV Env induced substantial membrane fusion, not only in the permissive 293 cells but also in the nonpermissive CHO cells that lack a functional XPR1 receptor. The increased fusion activities of these truncations correlated with their enhanced SU shedding into culture media, suggesting conformational changes in the ectodomain of XMRV Env. Noticeably, further truncation of the CT of XMRV Env proximal to the membrane-spanning domain severely impaired the Env fusogenicity, as well as dramatically decreased the Env incorporations into MoMLV oncoretroviral and HIV-1 lentiviral vectors resulting in greatly reduced viral transductions. Collectively, our studies reveal that XMRV entry does not require a low pH or low pH-dependent host proteases, and that the cytoplasmic tail of XMRV Env critically modulates membrane fusion and cell entry. Our data also imply that additional cellular factors besides XPR1 are likely to be involved in XMRV entry.","publish_time":"2012-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"C\u00F4t\u00E9, Marceline; Zheng, Yi-Min; Liu, Shan-Lu","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6a776cdff97d90eae72e7f8be666aef3a14224e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3313918.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3313918/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzI5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Xenotropic"],"organizations":["XMRV","XMRV Env","CHO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["XMRV entry","ectodomain of XMRV Env","length XMRV Env","XMRV envelope","cytoplasmic tail of XMRV Env","CT of XMRV Env proximal","Env incorporations","Env fusogenicity","cell entry","cell-cell fusion","substantial membrane fusion","increased fusion activities","functional XPR1 receptor","viral receptor","low pH-dependent host proteases","nonpermissive CHO cells","human diseases","viral transductions","Recent studies","cellular protease inhibitors","additional cellular factors","human prostate cancer patients","syncytia formation","culture media","truncations","HIV","conformational changes","amino acid residues","lysosomotropic agents","MoMLV oncoretroviral","enhanced SU shedding","Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus","association","lentiviral vectors","mediated pseudoviral infection","C-terminal","recombinant mouse retrovirus","chronic fatigue syndrome","data","gammaretrovirus"],"language":"en"},

We investigated a possible cluster of SARS-CoV infections in healthcare workers who used contact and droplet precautions during attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a SARS patient. Unlike previously reported instances of transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, the index case-patient was unresponsive, and the intubation procedure was performed quickly and without difficulty. However, before intubation, the patient was ventilated with a bag-valve-mask that may have contributed to aerosolization of SARS-CoV. On the basis of the results of this investigation and previous reports of SARS transmission during aerosol-generating procedures, a systematic approach to the problem is outlined, including the use of the following: 1) administrative controls, 2) environmental engineering controls, 3) personal protective equipment, and 4) quality control.","publish_time":"2004-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Christian, Michael D.; Loutfy, Mona; McDonald, L.

Nevertheless, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of porcine circovirus (PCV) genome in the process of its evolution is available. In this study, to give a new understanding on the evolutionary characteristics of PCV and the effects of natural selection from its host on the codon usage pattern of the virus, Patterns and the key determinants of codon usage in PCV were examined. METHODS: We carried out comprehensive analysis on codon usage pattern in the PCV genome, by calculating relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), effective number of codons (ENC), dinucleotides and nucleic acid content of the PCV genome. RESULTS: PCV genomes have relatively much lower content of GC and codon preference, this result shows that nucleotide constraints have a major impact on its synonymous codon usage. The results of the correspondence analysis indicate codon usage patterns of PCV of various genotypes, various subgenotypes changed greatly, and significant differences in codon usage patterns of Each virus of Circoviridae.There is much comparability between PCV and its host in their synonymous codon usage, suggesting that the natural selection pressure from the host factor also affect the codon usage patterns of PCV. In particular, PCV genotype II is in synonymous codon usage more similar to pig than to PCV genotype I, which may be one of the most important molecular mechanisms of PCV genotype II to cause disease. The calculations results of the relative abundance of dinucleotides indicate that the composition of dinucleotides also plays a key role in the variation found in synonymous codon usage in PCV. Furthermore, geographic factors, the general average hydrophobicity and the aromaticity may be related to the formation of codon usage patterns of PCV. CONCLUSION: The results of these studies suggest that synonymous codon usage pattern of PCV genome are the result of interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection from its host. The information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding the characteristics of synonymous codon usage in PCV genomes, but also have significant value for the molecular evolution of PCV.","publish_time":"2012-03-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"LIU, Xin-sheng; Zhang, Yong-guang; Fang, Yu-zhen; Wang, Yong-lu","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2263b3300cd722dfbadc7c40008126d95ab4af6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3341187.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341187/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCV","GC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Analysis of codon usage","formation of codon usage patterns of PCV","synonymous codon usage pattern of PCV genome","characteristics of synonymous codon usage","relative synonymous codon usage","PCV genomes","codon preference","key determinants of codon usage","synonymous codon usage pattern of porcine circovirus","molecular evolution of PCV","evolutionary characteristics of PCV","important molecular mechanisms of PCV genotype","host factor","calculations results","significant value","relative abundance of dinucleotides","composition of dinucleotides","comprehensive analysis","correspondence analysis","study","result shows","various subgenotypes","various genotypes","result of interaction","significant differences","key role","virus of Circoviridae","theoretical value","mutation pressure","little information","new understanding","nucleic acid content","lower content of GC","RSCU","major impact","nucleotide constraints","studies","effective number of codons","general average hydrophobicity","variation","pig","geographic factors","aromaticity","effects of","process","comparability","BACKGROUND","METHODS","CONCLUSION","viruses","disease"],"language":"en"},

The major capsid protein of GII.4 strains is evolving rapidly, resulting in new epidemic strains with altered antigenic potentials. To test if antigenic drift may contribute to GII.4 persistence, human memory B cells were immortalized and the resulting human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) characterized for reactivity to a panel of time-ordered GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs). Reflecting the complex exposure history of the volunteer, human anti-GII.4 mAbs grouped into three VLP reactivity patterns; ancestral (1987\u20131997), contemporary (2004\u20132009), and broad (1987\u20132009). NVB 114 reacted exclusively to the earliest GII.4 VLPs by EIA and blockade. NVB 97 specifically bound and blocked only contemporary GII.4 VLPs, while NBV 111 and 43.9 exclusively reacted with and blocked variants of the GII.4.2006 Minerva strain. Three mAbs had broad GII.4 reactivity. Two, NVB 37.10 and 61.3, also detected other genogroup II VLPs by EIA but did not block any VLP interactions with carbohydrate ligands. NVB 71.4 cross-neutralized the panel of time-ordered GII.4 VLPs, as measured by VLP-carbohydrate blockade assays. Using mutant VLPs designed to alter predicted antigenic epitopes, two evolving, GII.4-specific, blockade epitopes were mapped. Amino acids 294\u2013298 and 368\u2013372 were required for binding NVB 114, 111 and 43.9 mAbs. Amino acids 393\u2013395 were essential for binding NVB 97, supporting earlier correlations between antibody blockade escape and carbohydrate binding variation. These data inform VLP vaccine design, provide a strategy for expanding the cross-blockade potential of chimeric VLP vaccines, and identify an antibody with broadly neutralizing therapeutic potential for the treatment of human disease. Moreover, these data support the hypothesis that GII.4 norovirus evolution is heavily influenced by antigenic variation of neutralizing epitopes and consequently, antibody-driven receptor switching; thus, protective herd immunity is a driving force in norovirus molecular evolution.","publish_time":"2012-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lindesmith, Lisa C.; Beltramello, Martina; Donaldson, Eric F.; Corti, Davide; Swanstrom, Jesica; Debbink, Kari; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Baric, Ralph S.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dc6666eb8156bd4638809009f795ebd4a7843569.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3355092.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355092/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzQ2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NVB","EIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["broad GII","contemporary GII","earliest GII","human anti-GII","binding NVB","blockade epitopes","mAbs","major capsid protein of GII","VLP-carbohydrate blockade assays","mutant VLPs","antibody blockade escape","VLP interactions","VLP reactivity patterns","antigenic variation of neutralizing epitopes","cross-blockade potential of chimeric VLP vaccines","predicted antigenic epitopes","carbohydrate binding variation","antigenic drift","VLP vaccine design","altered antigenic potentials","treatment of human disease","new epidemic strains","norovirus evolution","resulting human monoclonal antibodies","strains accounting","carbohydrate ligands","panel of time","EIA","data","evolving","Amino acids","human memory B cells","antibody-driven receptor","norovirus molecular evolution","therapeutic potential","blocked variants","principal cause of epidemic gastroenteritis","driving force","earlier correlations","volunteer","protective herd immunity","persistence","strategy","complex exposure history","hypothesis","Noroviruses","particles","Minerva strain","infections","genogroup","NBV"],"language":"en"},

The World Health Organization (WHO) 2009 dengue guidelines defined AST or ALT\u22651000 units/liter (U/L) as a criterion for severe dengue. We aimed to assess the clinical relevance and discriminatory value of AST or ALT for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and severe dengue. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We retrospectively studied and classified polymerase chain reaction positive dengue patients from 2006 to 2008 treated at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore according to WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria for dengue severity. Of 690 dengue patients, 31% had DHF and 24% severe dengue. Elevated AST and ALT occurred in 86% and 46%, respectively. Seven had AST or ALT\u22651000 U/L. None had acute liver failure but one patient died. Median AST and ALT values were significantly higher with increasing dengue severity by both WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria. However, they were poorly discriminatory between non-severe and severe dengue (e.g., AST area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57\u20130.67) and between dengue fever (DF) and DHF (AST area under the ROC curve = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.52\u20130.61). There was significant overlap in AST and ALT values among patients with dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue, and between those with DF and DHF.

The pathogen is present in very high levels within infected plants and can be transmitted by a broad range of mechanisms; therefore early specific detection is vital for effective disease management. In this study, a polyclonal antibody (pAb) was developed and deployed in a lateral flow device (LFD) format to allow rapid in\u2010field detection of Xcm. Published Xcm PCR assays were also independently assessed: only two assays gave specific amplification of Xcm, whilst others cross\u2010reacted with non\u2010target Xanthomonas species. Pure cultures of Xcm were used to immunize a rabbit, the IgG antibodies purified from the serum and the resulting polyclonal antibodies tested using ELISA and LFD. Testing against a wide range of bacterial species showed the pAb detected all strains of Xcm, representing isolates from seven countries and the known genetic diversity of Xcm. The pAb also detected the closely related Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vasculorum (Xav), primarily a sugarcane pathogen. Detection was successful in both naturally and experimentally infected banana plants, and the LFD limit of detection was 10(5) cells mL(\u22121). Whilst the pAb is not fully specific for Xcm, Xav has never been found in banana. Therefore the LFD can be used as a first\u2010line screening tool to detect Xcm in the field. Testing by LFD requires no equipment, can be performed by non\u2010scientists and is cost\u2010effective.

We investigated the genetic control of the acute\u2010phase protein response in pristane\u2010induced arthritis (PIA), which is a chronic erosive arthritis model in rats. METHODS: Plasma levels of the acute\u2010phase proteins interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106), \u03B1(1)\u2010acid glycoprotein (orosomucoid), fibrinogen, and \u03B1(1)\u2010inhibitor(3) were quantified in 3 strains of rats during the development and progression of disease: DA and LEW.1F, which are susceptible to arthritis, and E3, which is resistant. Genetic linkage analysis was performed on an F(2) intercross between E3 and DA to determine the genetic control of the acute\u2010phase response in arthritis. Elevated levels of \u03B1(1)\u2010acid glycoprotein were associated with acute inflammation, whereas levels of IL\u20106 were increased during the entire course of the disease. RESULTS: Using these acute\u2010phase markers as quantitative traits in linkage analysis revealed a colocalization of loci controlling the acute\u2010phase response and regions previously shown to control the development of arthritis in chromosomes 10, 12, and 14. In addition, 2 loci that were not associated with arthritis were found to regulate serum levels of the acute\u2010phase protein Apr1 (acute\u2010phase response 1) at the telomeric end of chromosome 12 and Apr2 on chromosome 5. CONCLUSION: The PIA model in rats is a useful tool for understanding some of the pathways leading to chronic erosive arthritis. The analysis of acute\u2010phase proteins in PIA and its application as quantitative traits for studying the genetics of arthritis will promote the understanding of the genetic regulation of the acute\u2010phase response.","publish_time":"2002-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Olofsson, Peter; Nordquist, Niklas; Vingsbo\u2010Lundberg, Carina; Larsson, Anders; Falkenberg, Cecilia; Pettersson, Ulf; \u00C5kerstr\u00F6m, Bo; Holmdahl, Rikard","journal":"Arthritis Rheum","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14c8f154cabd1b46a9ad12dc6ca0999145ce0454.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159512.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159512/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs1Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PIA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phase response","analysis of acute","phase protein response","acute inflammation","development of arthritis","phase inflammatory response","phase markers","induced arthritis","genetics of arthritis","phase protein Apr1","phase proteins interleukin","development of rheumatoid arthritis","chronic erosive arthritis model","genetic control","Genetic linkage analysis","levels of IL","Elevated levels of \u03B1","PIA model","Plasma levels","serum levels","genetic regulation","quantitative traits","DA","acid glycoprotein","strains of rats","E3","understanding","colocalization of loci","progression of disease","telomeric end of chromosome","pristane","pathophysiologic role","LEW","application","specific components","Apr2","useful tool","orosomucoid","fibrinogen","pathways","regions","intercross","CONCLUSION","METHODS","OBJECTIVE","entire course","chromosomes","RESULTS","addition","inhibitor"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Serum COMP levels were quantified by immunoassay. Sera were obtained from DA, E3, and (E3 \u00D7 DA)F(1) rats each week between the ages of 4 and 30 weeks. The (E3 \u00D7 DA)F(2) (second generation after intercrossing) rats were injected intradermally with the synthetic oil pristane. Arthritis was monitored by a macroscopic scoring system, and serum levels of COMP were measured on days 6, 35, and 49 after immunization. RESULTS: Serum levels of COMP decreased during growth, and reached a plateau after the age of 12 weeks. The DA rats had higher COMP levels than the E3 rats, and the (E3 \u00D7 DA)F(1) rats had intermediate levels. No differences were observed in these levels when the rats were grouped by sex. Arthritic (E3 \u00D7 DA)F(2) rats had increased serum concentrations of COMP on days 35 and 49 after pristane injection (P \u003C 0.0001 versus the nonarthritic animals). COMP levels correlated with the severity of macroscopically detectable arthritis at both time points (r \u003E 0.9). Rats with a chronic disease course were distinguished by higher serum concentrations of COMP during the acute stage than animals with similar clinical scores but with resolving arthritis (P \u003C 0.01). CONCLUSION: Serum analyses of COMP offer promise for monitoring tissue involvement in experimental arthritis. Such analyses should be useful for monitoring therapeutic interventions aimed at retarding tissue destruction as well as for studies of the genetically determined regulation of COMP turnover and susceptibility to arthritis.

Design Retrospective clinical study: the clinical records of all cats with histopathologically confirmed feline infectious peritonitis at the University Veterinary Centre Sydney and a private cat hospital in Sydney between 1990 and 2002 were reviewed for signalment, history, physical findings, diagnostic test results and the distribution of histological lesions throughout the body at necropsy. Results Forty\u2010two cats met the inclusion criteria. Significant features of this study that unique to the contemporary literature are i) the over\u2010representation of certain breeds (Burmese, Australian Mist, British Shorthaired, and Cornish Rex) and the under\u2010representation of other breeds (Domestic Shorthaired, Persian); ii) the overrepresentation of males; iii) the tendency for effusive disease in Australian Mist cats and non\u2010effusive disease in Burmese; iv) the even age distribution of disease seen in cats older than 2 years\u2010of\u2010age; and v) the presence of fulminant immune\u2010mediated haemolytic anaemia in two cats in this study.

Combination of gradual diastolic hypotension and tachycardia could reflect more serious vasodilatory conditions. We sought to evaluate the relationships between heart rate (HR) to diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) ratios and clinical outcomes during early phases of septic shock. METHODS: Diastolic shock index (DSI) was defined as the ratio between HR and DAP. DSI calculated just before starting vasopressors (Pre-VPs/DSI) in a preliminary cohort of 337 patients with septic shock (January 2015 to February 2017) and at vasopressor start (VPs/DSI) in 424 patients with septic shock included in a recent randomized controlled trial (ANDROMEDA-SHOCK; March 2017 to April 2018) was partitioned into five quantiles to estimate the relative risks (RR) of death with respect to the mean risk of each population (assumed to be 1). Matched HR and DAP subsamples were created to evaluate the effect of the individual components of the DSI on RRs. In addition, time-course of DSI and interaction between DSI and vasopressor dose (DSI*NE.dose) were compared between survivors and non-survivors from both populations, while ROC curves were used to identify variables predicting mortality. Finally, as exploratory observation, effect of early start of vasopressors was evaluated at each Pre-VPs/DSI quintile from the preliminary cohort. RESULTS: Risk of death progressively increased at gradual increments of Pre-VPs/DSI or VPs/DSI (One-way ANOVA, p \u003C 0.001). Progressive DAP decrease or HR increase was associated with higher mortality risks only when DSI concomitantly increased. Areas under the ROC curve for Pre-VPs/DSI, SOFA and initial lactate were similar, while mean arterial pressure and systolic shock index showed poor performances to predict mortality. Time-course of DSI and DSI*NE.dose was significantly higher in non-survivors from both populations (repeated-measures ANOVA, p \u003C 0.001). Very early start of vasopressors exhibited an apparent benefit at higher Pre-VPs/DSI quintile. CONCLUSIONS: DSI at pre-vasopressor and vasopressor start points might represent a very early identifier of patients at high risk of death. Isolated DAP or HR values do not clearly identify such risk. Usefulness of DSI to trigger or to direct therapeutic interventions in early resuscitation of septic shock need to be addressed in future studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ospina-Tasc\u00F3n, Gustavo A.; Teboul, Jean-Louis; Hernandez, Glenn; Alvarez, Ingrid; S\u00E1nchez-Ortiz, Alvaro I.; Calder\u00F3n-Tapia, Luis E.; Manzano-Nunez, Ramiro; Qui\u00F1ones, Edgardo; Madri\u00F1an-Navia, Humberto J.; Ruiz, Juan E.; Aldana, Jos\u00E9 L.; Bakker, Jan","journal":"Ann Intensive Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5caad3a56a5d1b673e90affb4384c33473a5cc9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7160223.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7160223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs2Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DAP","DSI","Pre-VPs/DSI","DSI*NE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DSI quintile","Usefulness of DSI","higher Pre-VPs","pre-vasopressor","early resuscitation of septic shock","early phases of septic shock","ANDROMEDA-SHOCK","Diastolic shock index","gradual increments of Pre-VPs","systolic shock index","vasopressor dose","effect of early start of vasopressors","key pathophysiological feature of septic shock","early identifier of patients","HR increase","HR values","Matched HR","DAP subsamples","Isolated DAP","Progressive DAP","mean risk","higher mortality risks","high risk of death","non-survivors","diastolic arterial pressure","populations","preliminary cohort","time-course","Combination of gradual diastolic hypotension","One-way ANOVA","relative risks","ROC curves","repeated-measures ANOVA","ratios","tachycardia","clinical outcomes","apparent benefit","recent randomized controlled trial","SOFA","interaction","direct therapeutic interventions","Loss of vascular tone","poor performances","initial lactate","points","heart rate","individual components","respect","exploratory observation","METHODS","serious vasodilatory conditions","BACKGROUND","relationships","variables","RRs","Areas","addition","CONCLUSIONS","quantiles","RESULTS","future studies"],"language":"en"},

For its development in RBCs, nutrients not only from the RBC cytosol but also from the extracellular milieu must be acquired. Although the utilization of host nutrients by P. falciparum has been extensively analysed, only a few studies have reported its utilization of host serum proteins. Hence, the aim of the current study was to comprehensively identify host serum proteins taken up by P. falciparum parasites and to elucidate their role in pathogenesis. METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum was cultured with human serum in vitro. Uptake of serum proteins by parasites was comprehensively determined via shotgun liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry and western blotting. The calcium ion concentration in serum was also evaluated, and coagulation activity of the parasite lysate was assessed. RESULTS: Three proteins, vitamin K-dependent protein S, prothrombin, and vitronectin, were selectively internalized under sufficient Ca(2\u002B) levels in the culture medium. The uptake of these proteins was initiated before DNA replication, and increased during the trophozoite and schizont stages, irrespective of the assembly/disassembly of actin filaments. Coagulation assay revealed that prothrombin was activated and thereby induced blood coagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Serum proteins were taken up by parasites under culture conditions with sufficient Ca(2\u002B) levels. This uptake phenomenon was associated with their pathogenicity.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tougan, Takahiro; Edula, Jyotheeswara R.; Morita, Masayuki; Takashima, Eizo; Honma, Hajime; Tsuboi, Takafumi; Horii, Toshihiro","journal":"Malar J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d7fecefeaca5d38afd61ec61500596756f0fac35.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161009.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161009/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs2ODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Uptake of serum proteins","utilization of host serum proteins","falciparum parasites","human serum","utilization of host nutrients","malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum","mass spectrometry","prothrombin","RBCs","sufficient Ca","various host factors","induced blood coagulation","levels","coagulation activity","Coagulation assay","uptake phenomenon","parasite lysate","culture conditions","culture medium","red blood cells","protozoan","shotgun liquid chromatography","dependent protein S","vitamin","western blotting","vitronectin","BACKGROUND","RBC cytosol","current study","trophozoite","schizont stages","disassembly of actin filaments","calcium ion concentration","role","extracellular milieu","DNA replication","aim","pathogenicity","development","RESULTS","studies","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","pathogenesis"],"language":"en"},

The pathogenesis of CPF involves both catecholamine-related cardiotoxicity following brainstem encephalitis and vasodilatory shock due to cytokine storm. Sympathetic hyperactivity, including tachycardia and hypertension, are the early clinical manifestations of cardiopulmonary involvement, which may progress to pulmonary edema/hemorrhage and/or CPF. The management strategy comprises multidisciplinary supportive treatment, including fluid management, positive pressure ventilation support, and use of milrinone, vasopressors, and inotropes.

While demyelination is a pathological end\u2010point that is common to all of these diseases, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this pathology are very different. These range from genetic defects that affect lipid metabolism in the leukodystrophies, cytopathic effects of viral infection in SSPE to the action of immunological effector mechanisms in MS and the viral encephalopathies. Irrespective of the initial cause of myelin degradation, many of these disorders are associated with some degree of CNS inflammation, as indicated by the local activation of microglia, recruitment of macrophages or the intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin. Many of these phenomena are now being duplicated in animal models, providing not only new insights into the pathogenesis of human demyelinating diseases, but also unexpected interrelationships between the immune response in the CNS and the pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimers disease and HIV encephalopathy.

Ezetimib significantly decreased the surface expression of CD13, CD16, CD64, and CD36; furthermore, it induced a shift of CD13 from plasma membrane to intracellular vesicles, and thus it quite likely modulated monocytic raft\u2010assembly. \u00A9 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology","publish_time":"2006-02-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ors\u00F3, Evelyn; Werner, Tobias; Wolf, Zsuzsanna; Bandulik, Sascha; Kramer, Werner; Schmitz, Gerd","journal":"Cytometry A","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a661f6b3d9770e4f00f5c37a35bd23196d2810d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162404.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162404/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs4MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ezetimib"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["shift of CD13","surface expression of CD13","Cellular redistribution of CD13","Expression of raft","administration of Ezetimib","Ezetimib influences raft function","CD16","CD64","CD36","cholesterol absorption inhibitor Ezetimib","likely modulated monocytic raft","lipid rafts of monocytic cells","response","CD11b","associated antigens","derived macrophages","plasma membrane","CD14","human monocyte","molecular target","intracellular vesicles","assembly","International Society","Analytical Cytology","flow cytometry","confocal imaging","Aminopeptidase N"],"language":"en"},

We tested whether domestication has changed the potential of crop mixtures to over\u2010yield by comparing the performance and traits of major crop species and those of their wild progenitors under varying levels of diversity.

High\u2010capacity screening methods are in place for ligand capture and interaction screening, but a detailed dynamic characterization of molecular interactions under physiological conditions in efficiently separated mixtures with minimal sample consumption is presently provided only by electrophoretic interaction analysis in capillaries, affinity CE (ACE). This has been realized in different fields of biology and analytical chemistry, and the resulting advances and uses of ACE during the last 2.5 years are covered in this review. Dealing with anything from small divalent metal ions to large supramolecular assemblies, the applications of ACE span from low\u2010affinity binding of broad specificity being exploited in optimizing selectivity, e.g., in enantiomer analysis to miniaturized affinity technologies, e.g., for fast processing immunoassay. Also, approaches that provide detailed quantitative characterization of analyte\u2013ligand interaction for drug, immunoassay, and aptamer development are increasingly important, but various approaches to ACE are more and more generally applied in biological research.

Of the 75 taxa of Habronattus and outgroups studied, 47 have X(1)X(2)0 sex chromosomes in males, 10 have X(1)X(2)Y, 15 have X(1)X(2)X(3)Y, 2 have X0, and one has both X(1)X(2)0 and X(1)X(2)X(3)Y. Chromosome numbers and behavior suggest neo\u2010Ys formed by an autosome\u2010X fusion to make X(1)X(2)Y, with a second fusion to an autosome to make X(1)X(2)X(3)Y. Phylogeny shows at least 8\u201315 gains (or possibly some losses) of neo\u2010Y (i.e., X\u2010autosome fusions), a remarkable number for such a small clade. In contrast to the many X\u2010autosome fusions, at most one autosome\u2013autosome fusion is indicated. Origins of neo\u2010Y are correlated significantly with distal localization of chiasmata, supporting White\u0027s hypothesis that evolution of neo\u2010Y systems is facilitated by looser pairing (distal chiasmata) at meiosis. However, an alternative (or contributing) explanation for the correlation is that X\u2010autosome fusions were selected to permit isolation of male\u2010favored alleles to the neo\u2010Y chromosome, aided by distal chiasmata limiting recombination. This intralocus sexual conflict hypothesis could explain both the many X\u2010autosome fusions, and the stunning complexity of male Habronattus courtship displays.","publish_time":"2013-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maddison, Wayne P.; Leduc\u2010Robert, Genevi\u00E8ve","journal":"Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2dce2d54917ec9b41e1ce75fee1c189ecc108ae8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7163710.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7163710/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5MDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M.

We have shown that the cytoskeletal passive stiffness of airway smooth muscle (ASM) can be regulated by intracellular signaling pathways, especially those associated with Rho kinase (ROCK). We have also shown that an oscillatory strain reduces the passive stiffness of ASM and its ability to generate force. Here, we investigated the combined effect of inhibiting the ASM contraction with \u03B2(2) agonist and decreasing the ASM cytoskeletal stiffness with ROCK inhibitor and/or force oscillation (FO) on the relaxation of contracted ASM. We hypothesize that the ASM relaxation can be synergistically enhanced by the combination of these interventions, because drug-induced softening of the cytoskeleton enhances the FO-induced relaxation and vice versa. Sheep tracheal strips were isotonically contracted to acetylcholine (3 \u00D7 10(\u22125) M). At the plateau of shortening, \u03B2(2) agonist salbutamol (10(\u22127) M), ROCK inhibitor H1152 (10(\u22127) M), and FO (square wave, 1 Hz, amplitude 6% maximal active force) were applied either alone or in combination. After adjusting for nonspecific time-dependent variation, relengthening by individual interventions with low-dose salbutamol or H1152, or small amplitude FO was not significantly different from zero. However, significant relengthening was observed in all combination treatments. The relengthening was greater than the mathematical sum of relengthening caused by individual treatments thereby demonstrating synergistic relaxation. The ASM stiffness did not change with salbutamol or H1152 treatments, but was lower with FO in combination with H1152. The results suggest that the mechanopharmacological treatment can be an effective therapy for asthma.","publish_time":"2019-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Lu; Chitano, Pasquale; Par\u00E9, Peter D.; Seow, Chun Y.","journal":"J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a02e182d5c087b2151c00969ca24b8860af925d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164492.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164492/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5NDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ASM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ASM stiffness","ASM relaxation","passive stiffness of ASM","ASM cytoskeletal stiffness","relaxation of contracted ASM","ASM contraction","FO-induced relaxation","H1152 treatments","combination treatments","ROCK inhibitor H1152","small amplitude FO","individual treatments","significant relengthening","agonist salbutamol","synergistic relaxation","individual interventions","mathematical sum of relengthening","force oscillation","cytoskeletal passive stiffness of airway smooth muscle","low-dose salbutamol","maximal active force","drug-induced softening","Hz","cytoskeleton","nonspecific time-dependent variation","mechanopharmacological treatment","effective therapy","square wave","ability","oscillatory strain","Asthmatic airways","combined effect","Sheep tracheal strips","Rho kinase","acetylcholine","pathways","results","plateau"],"language":"en"},

These endogenous molecules, termed alarmins, are normal cell constituents that can be released into the extracellular milieu during states of cellular stress or damage and subsequently activate the immune system. One nuclear protein, High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), has received particular attention as fulfilling the functions of an alarmin by being involved in both infectious and non-infectious inflammatory conditions. Once released, HMGB1 signals through various receptors to activate immune cells involved in the immune process. Although initial studies demonstrated HMGB1 as a late mediator of sepsis, recent findings indicate HMGB1 to have an important role in models of non-infectious inflammation, such as autoimmunity, cancer, trauma, and ischemia reperfusion injury. Furthermore, in contrast to its pro-inflammatory functions, there is evidence that HMGB1 also has restorative effects leading to tissue repair and regeneration. The complex functions of HMGB1 as an archetypical alarmin are outlined here to review our current understanding of a molecule that holds the potential for treatment in many important human conditions.","publish_time":"2008-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klune, John R; Dhupar, Rajeev; Cardinal, Jon; Billiar, Timothy R; Tsung, Allan","journal":"Mol Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7b5ae07b62c867eff99fdb60cb3b07c8c8aeee88.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2323334.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2323334/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HMGB1 signals","complex functions of HMGB1","immune cells","immune process","pro-inflammatory functions","non-infectious inflammatory conditions","innate immune system","group of endogenous molecules","inflammatory responses","important human conditions","recent recognition","recent findings","important role","archetypical alarmin","foreign pathogens","current understanding","models of non-infectious inflammation","ischemia reperfusion injury","High mobility group box","late mediator of sepsis","termed alarmins","evidence","restorative effects","states of cellular stress","cancer","trauma","nuclear protein","treatment","damage","various receptors","normal cell constituents","extracellular milieu","tissue repair","potential","autoimmunity","similar function","initial studies","framework","regeneration","overlap","contrast","particular attention","products"],"language":"en"},

Stress response can either repair the damage or activate one of the programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms, for example apoptosis, and finally end in cell death. One striking characteristic, which accompanies apoptosis in both vertebrates and yeast, is a fragmentation of cellular DNA and mammalian apoptosis is often associated with degradation of different RNAs. We show that in yeast exposed to stimuli known to induce apoptosis, such as hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, hyperosmotic stress and ageing, two large subunit ribosomal RNAs, 25S and 5.8S, became extensively degraded with accumulation of specific intermediates that differ slightly depending on cell death conditions. This process is most likely endonucleolytic, is correlated with stress response, and depends on the mitochondrial respiratory status: rRNA is less susceptible to degradation in respiring cells with functional defence against oxidative stress. In addition, RNA fragmentation is independent of two yeast apoptotic factors, metacaspase Yca1 and apoptosis-inducing factor Aif1, but it relies on the apoptotic chromatin condensation induced by histone H2B modifications. These data describe a novel phenotype for certain stress- and ageing-related PCD pathways in yeast.","publish_time":"2008-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mroczek, Seweryn; Kufel, Joanna","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fcbb20fc325656ad86d5ed3e810cd0f4639ada77.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2396418.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2396418/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUzNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oxidative stress","Stress response","hyperosmotic stress","certain stress","mammalian apoptosis","example apoptosis","cell death conditions","yeast apoptotic factors","programmed cell death","degradation of different RNAs","ageing-related PCD pathways","RNA fragmentation","environmental conditions","apoptotic chromatin condensation","fragmentation of cellular DNA","large subunit ribosomal RNAs","respiring cells","metacaspase Yca1","acetic acid","functional defence","mechanisms","hydrogen peroxide","rRNA","histone H2B modifications","novel phenotype","mitochondrial respiratory status","respiration","reactive oxygen species","factor Aif1","likely endonucleolytic","Organisms","data","addition","damage","vertebrates","accumulation of specific intermediates","process","striking characteristic","stimuli"],"language":"en"},

The importance of the UPS in viral pathogenesis has become increasingly apparent. Using murine cardiomyocytes, we have previously demonstrated that the UPS plays a key role in the replication of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an important human pathogen associated with various diseases. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we examined the interplay between the UPS and CVB3, focusing on the role of ubiquitination in viral lifecycle. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As assessed by in situ hybridization, Western blot, and plaque assay, we showed that proteasome inhibition decreased CVB3 RNA replication, protein synthesis, and viral titers in HeLa cells. There were no apparent changes in 20S proteasome activities following CVB3 infection. However, we found viral infection led to an accumulation of protein-ubiquitin conjugates, accompanied by a decreased protein expression of free ubiquitin, implicating an important role of ubiquitination in the UPS-mediated viral replication. Using small-interfering RNA, we demonstrated that gene-silencing of ubiquitin significantly reduced viral titers, possibly through downregulation of protein ubiquitination and subsequent alteration of protein function and/or degradation. Inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes apparently enhances the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors on CVB3 replication. Finally, by immunoprecipitation, we showed that coxsackieviral polymerase 3D was post-translationally modified by ubiquitination and such modification might be a prerequisite for its function in transcriptional regulation of viral genome. CONCLUSION: Coxsackievirus infection promotes protein ubiquitination, contributing to effective viral replication, probably through ubiquitin modification of viral polymerase.","publish_time":"2008-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Si, Xiaoning; Gao, Guang; Wong, Jerry; Wang, Yahong; Zhang, Jingchun; Luo, Honglin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9e45efb86c7c552be221e4d1356d9374a7ebc204.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2440516.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440516/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UPS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","viral titers","CVB3 replication","effective viral replication","viral pathogenesis","viral lifecycle","UPS","downregulation of protein ubiquitination","ubiquitin modification of viral polymerase","protein synthesis","accumulation of protein","CVB3 RNA replication","CVB3 infection","important role of ubiquitination","transcriptional regulation of viral genome","decreased protein expression of free ubiquitin","proteasome inhibition","ubiquitin conjugates","subsequent alteration of protein function","replication of coxsackievirus B3","proteasome system","Coxsackievirus infection","S proteasome activities","key role","degradation","inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors","coxsackieviral polymerase","critical mechanisms","apparent changes","underlying mechanisms","important human pathogen","Inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes","small-interfering RNA","regulation of numerous essential cellular functions","Western blot","plaque assay","situ hybridization","various diseases","prerequisite","gene-silencing","interplay","CONCLUSION","HeLa cells","importance","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","METHODOLOGY","immunoprecipitation","BACKGROUND","murine cardiomyocytes"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult patients with laboratory-confirmed Chikungunya fever infection, who were referred to the Communicable Disease Centre/Tan Tock Seng Hospital during the period from January to February 2008, were included in this retrospective study. Plasma fractions were analyzed using a multiplex-microbead immunoassay. Among the patients, the most common clinical features were fever (100%), arthralgia (90%), rash (50%) and conjunctivitis (40%). Profiles of 30 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were able to discriminate the clinical forms of Chikungunya from healthy controls, with patients classified as non-severe and severe disease. Levels of 8 plasma cytokines and 4 growth factors were significantly elevated.

RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, and fever and high rates of abortions in livestock. A nonstructural RVFV NSs protein inhibits the transcription of host mRNAs, including interferon-\u03B2 mRNA, and is a major virulence factor. The present study explored a novel function of the RVFV NSs protein by testing the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD) or \u03B1-amanitin, both of which served as a surrogate of the host mRNA synthesis suppression function of the NSs. In the presence of the host-transcriptional inhibitors, the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs protein, but not that carrying NSs, induced double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)\u2013mediated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2\u03B1 phosphorylation, leading to the suppression of host and viral protein translation. RVFV NSs promoted post-transcriptional downregulation of PKR early in the course of the infection and suppressed the phosphorylated eIF2\u03B1 accumulation. These data suggested that a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-induced host transcriptional suppression induces PKR-mediated eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation, while the NSs facilitates efficient viral translation by downregulating PKR and inhibiting PKR-mediated eIF2\u03B1 phosphorylation. Thus, the two distinct functions of the NSs, i.e., the suppression of host transcription, including that of type I interferon mRNAs, and the downregulation of PKR, work together to prevent host innate antiviral functions, allowing efficient replication and survival of RVFV in infected mammalian hosts.","publish_time":"2009-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ikegami, Tetsuro; Narayanan, Krishna; Won, Sungyong; Kamitani, Wataru; Peters, C.

The ratio of modified to unmodified CP for the read-through expression clone developed was also found to be approximately 1:1, higher than what has been previously reported. It was also observed that infectivity was not affected by differences in pI between the chimera and its wild counterpart. Analysis of recombinant viruses after 21-days-postinculation (dpi) revealed that deletions occurred resulting in partial reversions of the viral population to near wild type and suggesting that this would be the limiting harvest period for obtaining true to type recombinants with this construct.","publish_time":"2009-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Teoh, Pak-Guan; Ooi, Aik-Seng; AbuBakar, Sazaly; Othman, Rofina Yasmin","journal":"J Biomed Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/190a3e95092a129b94052ac128ce9b690350d9af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2659398.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2659398/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzYxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CGMMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wild-type CGMMV read-through sequence","CGMMV coat protein","near wild type","CAA-UAG","CAA-UUA","full-length capped recombinant CGMMV transcripts","unmodified CP","truncated dengue virus type","wild counterpart","EB4 genes","Read-through sequences of TMV","read-through expression clone","Analysis of recombinant viruses","infectious viruses","AAA-UAG","protein binding region","Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus","envelope","infection of host plant","muskmelon","open reading frame","viral population","amino acids","terminal end","pRG","Cucumis melo","partial reversions","pRT","FSRTRE","chimera","ORF","limiting harvest period","differences","recombinants","chimeric clones","deletions","pCG","leaves","pI","days-postinculation","construct","ratio","infectivity"],"language":"en"},

Using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), we demonstrate that while human and avian influenza viruses efficiently infect at temperatures of the human distal airways (37\u00B0C), avian, but not human, influenza viruses are restricted for infection at the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways (32\u00B0C). These data support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses, ordinarily adapted to the temperature of the avian enteric tract (40\u00B0C), rarely infect humans, in part due to differences in host airway regional temperatures. Previously, a critical residue at position 627 in the avian influenza virus polymerase subunit, PB2, was identified as conferring temperature-dependency in mammalian cells. Here, we use reverse genetics to show that avianization of residue 627 attenuates a human virus, but does not account for the different infection between 32\u00B0C and 37\u00B0C. To determine the mechanism of temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses in HAE at 32\u00B0C, we generated recombinant human influenza viruses in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genetic background that contained avian or avian-like glycoproteins. Two of these viruses, A/Victoria/3/75 with L226Q and S228G mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 and A/PR/8/34 containing the H7 and N1 from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99, exhibited temperature restriction approaching that of wholly avian influenza viruses. These data suggest that influenza viruses bearing avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins have a reduced capacity to establish productive infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways. This temperature restriction may limit zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses and suggests that adaptation of avian influenza viruses to efficient infection at 32\u00B0C may represent a critical evolutionary step enabling human-to-human transmission.","publish_time":"2009-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Scull, Margaret A.; Gillim-Ross, Laura; Santos, Celia; Roberts, Kim L.; Bordonali, Elena; Subbarao, Kanta; Barclay, Wendy S.; Pickles, Raymond J.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0162b627476379a84d5a92480a881efdd3063f66.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2673688.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2673688/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzYyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["adaptation of avian influenza viruses","recombinant human influenza viruses","zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses","mechanism of temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses","human transmission","human virus","avian influenza virus polymerase subunit","human proximal airways","avian enteric tract","human distal airways","ciliated epithelium of human airways","model of human ciliated airway epithelium","conferring temperature-dependency","efficient infection","productive infection","different infection","cooler temperatures","HAE","critical residue","Italy","data","Chick","Victoria","host airway regional temperatures","surface glycoproteins","avianization of residue","critical evolutionary step","PB2","bird","rare event","hemagglutinin","differences","reduced capacity","position","S228G mutations","genetic background","L226Q","mammalian cells","H1N1","hypothesis","neuraminidase","H7","ex","reverse genetics","H3N2","humans"],"language":"en"},

The prolonged immunosuppression following specific treatment may be associated with a high risk of developing severe infections. Recently, the use of monoclonal antibodies (rituximab) has allowed sustained remissions to be obtained in the majority of pediatric patients with refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of an 8-month-old Caucasian girl affected by a severe form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which required continuous steroid treatment for 16 months. Thereafter, she received 4 weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)/dose) associated with steroid therapy, which was then tapered over the subsequent 2 weeks. One month after the last dose of rrituximab, she presented with recurrence of severe hemolysis and received two more doses of rrituximab. The patient remained in clinical remission for 7 months, before presenting with a further relapse. An alternative heavy immunosuppressive therapy was administered combining cyclophosphamide 10 mg/kg/day for 10 days with methylprednisolone 40 mg/kg/day for 5 days, which was then tapered down over 3 weeks. While still on steroid therapy, the patient developed an interstitial pneumonia with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, which required immediate admission to the intensive care unit where extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was administered continuously for 37 days. At 16-month follow-up, the patient is alive and in good clinical condition, with no organ dysfunction, free from any immunosuppressive treatment and with a normal Hb level. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that aggressive combined immunosuppressive therapy may lead to a sustained complete remission in children with refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia. However, the severe life-threatening complication presented by our patient indicates that strict clinical monitoring must be vigilantly performed, that antimicrobial prophylaxis should always be considered and that experienced medical and nursing staff must be available, to deliver highly specialized supportive salvage therapies, if necessary, during intensive care monitoring.","publish_time":"2009-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beretta, Chiara; Leoni, Veronica; Rossi, Mario Renato; Jankovic, Momcilo; Patroniti, Nicolo; Foti, Giuseppe; Biagi, Ettore","journal":"J Med Case Reports","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/73de1d6e4f75f6faed0be87bdb3994b18ce15d29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2726476.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2726476/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["steroid therapy","severe form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia","refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia","immunosuppressive treatment","severe course","severe infections","days","alternative heavy immunosuppressive therapy","aggressive combined immunosuppressive therapy","clinical remission","continuous steroid treatment","recurrence of severe hemolysis","severe life-threatening complication","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy","intensive care monitoring","specific treatment","strict clinical monitoring","CASE PRESENTATION","months","doses of rrituximab","dose of rrituximab","weeks","intensive care unit","sustained complete remission","good clinical condition","weekly doses of rituximab","children younger","sustained remissions","month follow-up","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome","immediate admission","interstitial pneumonia","organ dysfunction","majority of pediatric patients","combining cyclophosphamide","specialized supportive salvage therapies","month-old Caucasian girl","years of age","INTRODUCTION","normal Hb level","high risk","use of monoclonal antibodies","nursing staff","prolonged immunosuppression","mortality rate","methylprednisolone","CONCLUSIONS","antimicrobial prophylaxis","relapse"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we systematically tested three additional herpesvirus species, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), murine cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, for protein interactions in order to be able to perform a comparative analysis of all three herpesvirus subfamilies. We identified 735 interactions by genome-wide yeast-two-hybrid screens (Y2H), and, together with the interactomes of VZV and KSHV, included a total of 1,007 intraviral protein interactions in the analysis. Whereas a large number of interactions have not been reported previously, we were able to identify a core set of highly conserved protein interactions, like the interaction between HSV-1 UL33 with the nuclear egress proteins UL31/UL34. Interactions were conserved between orthologous proteins despite generally low sequence similarity, suggesting that function may be more conserved than sequence. By combining interactomes of different species we were able to systematically address the low coverage of the Y2H system and to extract biologically relevant interactions which were not evident from single species.","publish_time":"2009-09-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fossum, Even; Friedel, Caroline C.; Rajagopala, Seesandra V.; Titz, Bj\u00F6rn; Baiker, Armin; Schmidt, Tina; Kraus, Theo; Stellberger, Thorsten; Rutenberg, Christiane; Suthram, Silpa; Bandyopadhyay, Sourav; Rose, Dietlind; von Brunn, Albrecht; Uhlmann, Mareike; Zeretzke, Christine; Dong, Yu-An; Boulet, H\u00E9l\u00E8ne; Koegl, Manfred; Bailer, Susanne M.; Koszinowski, Ulrich; Ideker, Trey; Uetz, Peter; Zimmer, Ralf; Haas, J\u00FCrgen","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d0a8b7f4cb8c1c634db8716057ae04282f65687f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e5a9130fe91644dc7bd9ef4f8d26e1d07faaca08.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2731838.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2731838/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Herpesviruses"],"organizations":["VZV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["conserved protein interactions","intraviral protein interactions","relevant interactions","large number of interactions","protein interaction networks","additional herpesvirus species","interactomes of different species","HSV","Herpesviruses","herpesvirus subfamilies","KSHV","interactomes of VZV","single species","herpes simplex virus","varicella-zoster virus","Epstein-Barr virus","low sequence similarity","Kaposi\u0027s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus","orthologous proteins","low coverage","Y2H system","comparative analysis","variety of different diseases","nuclear egress proteins UL31","family of large DNA viruses","UL33","vertebrates","murine cytomegalovirus","function","total","core set","genome-wide yeast","hybrid screens","UL34","order","open reading frames","kbp","dsDNA genomes","study"],"language":"en"},

Without treatment, most patients eventually develop fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver and may need liver transplantation in the late stage of disease. PBC primarily affects women (female preponderance 9\u201310:1) with a prevalence of up to 1 in 1,000 women over 40 years of age. Common symptoms of the disease are fatigue and pruritus, but most patients are asymptomatic at first presentation. The diagnosis is based on sustained elevation of serum markers of cholestasis, i.e., alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, and the presence of serum antimitochondrial antibodies directed against the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Histologically, PBC is characterized by florid bile duct lesions with damage to biliary epithelial cells, an often dense portal inflammatory infiltrate and progressive loss of small intrahepatic bile ducts. Although the insight into pathogenetic aspects of PBC has grown enormously during the recent decade and numerous genetic, environmental, and infectious factors have been disclosed which may contribute to the development of PBC, the precise pathogenesis remains enigmatic. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only FDA-approved medical treatment for PBC. When administered at adequate doses of 13\u201315 mg/kg/day, up to two out of three patients with PBC may have a normal life expectancy without additional therapeutic measures. The mode of action of UDCA is still under discussion, but stimulation of impaired hepatocellular and cholangiocellular secretion, detoxification of bile, and antiapoptotic effects may represent key mechanisms. One out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and may need additional medical therapy and/or liver transplantation. This review summarizes current knowledge on the clinical, diagnostic, pathogenetic, and therapeutic aspects of PBC.","publish_time":"2009-07-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hohenester, Simon; Oude-Elferink, Ronald P.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: However we find autophagy has no measurable role in vacuolar escape and intracellular growth in primary cultured bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) deficient for autophagy (atg5(\u2212/\u2212)). Nevertheless, we provide evidence that the pore forming activity of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin listeriolysin O (LLO) can induce autophagy subsequent to infection by L. monocytogenes. Infection of BMDMs with L. monocytogenes induced microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation, consistent with autophagy activation, whereas a mutant lacking LLO did not. Infection of BMDMs that express LC3-GFP demonstrated that wild-type L. monocytogenes was encapsulated by LC3-GFP, consistent with autophagy activation, whereas a mutant lacking LLO was not. Bacillus subtilis expressing either LLO or a related cytolysin, perfringolysin O (PFO), induced LC3 colocalization and LC3 lipidation. Further, LLO-containing liposomes also recruited LC3-GFP, indicating that LLO was sufficient to induce targeted autophagy in the absence of infection. The role of autophagy had variable effects depending on the cell type assayed. In atg5(\u2212/\u2212) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, L. monocytogenes had a primary vacuole escape defect. However, the bacteria escaped and grew normally in atg5(\u2212/\u2212) BMDMs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We propose that membrane damage, such as that caused by LLO, triggers bacterial-targeted autophagy, although autophagy does not affect the fate of wild-type intracellular L. monocytogenes in primary BMDMs.","publish_time":"2010-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meyer-Morse, Nicole; Robbins, Jennifer R.; Rae, Chris S.; Mochegova, Sofia N.; Swanson, Michele S.; Zhao, Zijiang; Virgin, Herbert W.; Portnoy, Daniel","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89dc30e7b46b476142978f461feb4ecca1bf89b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2797616.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2797616/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzczNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LLO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["autophagy activation","role of autophagy","autophagy subsequent","Infection of BMDMs","bacterial-targeted autophagy","LC3 lipidation","primary BMDMs","Listeria monocytogenes infection","mutant lacking LLO","express LC3-GFP","induced LC3 colocalization","absence of infection","atg5","type intracellular","wild-type","cell type","monocytogenes induced microtubule-associated protein light chain","primary vacuole escape defect","intracellular growth","vacuolar escape","perfringolysin O","related cytolysin","measurable role","fate of wild","cholesterol-dependent cytolysin listeriolysin O","primary cultured bone marrow derived macrophages","PFO","activity","protective mechanism","variable effects","cells","mouse embryonic fibroblasts","SIGNIFICANCE","pore","Recent studies","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","liposomes","Bacillus subtilis","membrane damage","BACKGROUND","METHODOLOGY","evidence","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

The sequence contains 6 potential Asn-X-Ser/Thr motifs. Eight potential Ser phosphorylation sites and 1 potential Tyr phophorylation site were also identified. GC1 contains the Leu-Lys-Asn (LKN) motif instead of the typical Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) motif found in other aquatic birnaviruses.

In total, the VP1 regions of 22 birnavirus strains were compared for analyzing the genetic relationship among the family Birnaviridae. Based on the deduced amino acid sequences, GC1 was observed to be more closely related to the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) from the USA, Japan, and Korea than the IPNV from Europe. Further, aquatic birnaviruses containing GC1 and IPNV have genogroups that are distinct from those in the genus Avibirnaviruses and Entomo-birnaviruses. The birnavirusstrains were clustered into 5 genogroups based on their amino acid sequences. The marine aquatic birnaviruses (MABVs) containing GC1 were included in the MABV genogroup; the IPNV strains isolated from Korea, Japan, and the USA were included in genogroup 1 and the IPNV strains isolated primarily from Europe were included in genogroup 2.

Gag localizes to the plasma membrane (PM) and membranes of late endosomes, allowing for release of infectious virus directly from the cell membrane and/or upon exocytosis. The host factors involved in Gag trafficking to these sites are largely unknown. Upon activation, CD4\u002B T cells, the primary target of HIV infection, express the class II transcriptional activator (CIITA) and therefore the MHC class II isotype, HLA-DR. Similar to Gag, HLA-DR localizes to the PM and at the membranes of endosomes and specialized vesicular MHC class II compartments (MIICs). In HIV producer cells, transient HLA-DR expression induces intracellular Gag accumulation and impairs virus release. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that both stable and transient expression of CIITA in HIV producer cells does not induce HLA-DR-associated intracellular retention of Gag, but does increase the infectivity of virions. However, neither of these phenomena is due to recapitulation of the class II antigen presentation pathway or CIITA-mediated transcriptional activation of virus genes. Interestingly, we demonstrate that CIITA, apart from its transcriptional effects, acts cytoplasmically to enhance Pr160(gag-pol) (Gag-Pol) levels and thereby the viral protease and Gag processing, accounting for the increased infectivity of virions from CIITA-expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that CIITA enhances HIV Gag processing, and provides the first evidence of a novel, post-transcriptional, cytoplasmic function for a well-known transactivator.","publish_time":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Porter, Kristen A.; Kelley, Lauren N.; George, Annette; Harton, Jonathan A.; Duus, Karen M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1054ed358dfede6e22877513169bef30c491c363.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2892040.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892040/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzgyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV","MHC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gag-pol","HIV Gag processing","Gag trafficking","intracellular Gag accumulation","intracellular retention of Gag","HIV producer cells","transient expression of CIITA","polyprotein of HIV","transient HLA-DR expression","T cells","transcriptional effects","transcriptional activator","transcriptional activation of virus genes","virus release","specialized vesicular MHC class","membranes of endosomes","primary target of HIV infection","PM","release of infectious virus","membranes of late endosomes","increased infectivity of virions","cell membrane","plasma membrane","progeny virion","virion assembly","accounting","cytoplasmic function","antigen presentation pathway","viral protease","novel","compartments","study","recapitulation","evidence","CD4","MIICs","scaffold","Pr160","levels","isotype","well-known transactivator","maturation","SIGNIFICANCE","sites","host factors","Pr55","METHODOLOGY","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","CONCLUSIONS","exocytosis","BACKGROUND","phenomena"],"language":"en"},

Similarly, epidemic spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to avoid contact with those infected and to remain in touch with the healthy. Here we study disease dynamics in finite populations in which infection occurs along the links of a dynamical contact network whose reshaping may be biased based on each individual\u0027s health status. We adopt some of the most widely used epidemiological models, investigating the impact of the reshaping of the contact network on the disease dynamics. We derive analytical results in the limit where network reshaping occurs much faster than disease spreading and demonstrate numerically that this limit extends to a much wider range of time scales than one might anticipate. Specifically, we show that from a population-level description, disease propagation in a quickly adapting network can be formulated equivalently as disease spreading on a well-mixed population but with a rescaled infectiousness. We find that for all models studied here \u2013 SI, SIS and SIR \u2013 the effective infectiousness of a disease depends on the population size, the number of infected in the population, and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected. Importantly, we indicate how the use of available information hinders disease progression, either by reducing the average time required to eradicate a disease (in case recovery is possible), or by increasing the average time needed for a disease to spread to the entire population (in case recovery or immunity is impossible).","publish_time":"2010-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Segbroeck, Sven; Santos, Francisco C.; Pacheco, Jorge M.","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d61d66e22524793eb025db202a84eaaae50da2bf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a0016598cd0ea40803d8ab461f4ebdba9abe94c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2924249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozg0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disease dynamics","disease progression","disease propagation","network reshaping","population size","entire population","information individuals","dynamical contact network","average time","well-mixed population","population-level description","case recovery","local information","individuals aware","limit","capacity of healthy individuals","social contacts","number of infected","epidemic spreading","use of available information","individual\u0027s health status","rescaled infectiousness","effective infectiousness","wider range of time scales","epidemiological models","social dynamic","SIS","SIR","infection","links","finite populations","impact","immunity","analytical results","Human societies","complex webs","touch"],"language":"en"},

However, the \u2018humanization\u2019 of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a time-consuming and expensive process that has the inherent drawback of potentially altering antigenic specificity and/or affinity. The immortalization of human B cells represents an alternative for obtaining human mAbs, but relies on the availability of biological samples from vaccinated individuals or convalescent patients. In this work we describe a novel approach to generate fully human mAbs by combining a humanized mouse model with a new B cell immortalization technique.

Here, we have tested the efficiency of RNA oligonucleotides annealing downstream of the slippery sequence to induce frameshifting in vitro. Maximal frameshifting was observed with oligonucleotides of 12\u201318 nt. Antisense oligonucleotides bearing locked nucleid acid (LNA) modifications also proved to be efficient frameshift-stimulators in contrast to DNA oligonucleotides. The number, sequence and location of LNA bases in an otherwise DNA oligonucleotide have to be carefully manipulated to obtain optimal levels of frameshifting. Our data favor a model in which RNA stability at the entrance of the ribosomal tunnel is the major determinant of stimulating slippage rather than a specific three-dimensional structure of the stimulating RNA element.","publish_time":"2010-08-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Chien-Hung; Noteborn, Mathieu H.

Here we describe our experience in H1N1-induced ARDS using both ventilation strategy and ECMO assistance. METHODS: Following Italian Ministry of Health instructions, an Emergency Service was established at the Careggi Teaching Hospital (Florence, Italy) for the novel pandemic influenza. From Sept 09 to Jan 10, all patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Emergency Department with ARDS due to H1N1 infection were studied. All ECMO treatments were veno-venous. H1N1 infection was confirmed by PCR assayed on pharyngeal swab, subglottic aspiration and bronchoalveolar lavage. Lung pathology was evaluated daily by lung ultrasound (LUS) examination. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients were studied: 7 underwent ECMO treatment, and 5 responded to protective mechanical ventilation. Two patients had co-infection by Legionella Pneumophila. One woman was pregnant. In our series, PCR from bronchoalveolar lavage had a 100% sensitivity compared to 75% from pharyngeal swab samples. The routine use of LUS limited the number of chest X-ray examinations and decreased transportation to radiology for CT-scan, increasing patient safety and avoiding the transitory disconnection from ventilator. No major complications occurred during ECMO treatments. In three cases, bleeding from vascular access sites due to heparin infusion required blood transfusions. Overall mortality rate was 8.3%. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, early ECMO assistance resulted safe and feasible, considering the life threatening condition, in H1N1-induced ARDS. Lung ultrasound is an effective mean for daily assessment of ARDS patients.","publish_time":"2011-01-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cianchi, Giovanni; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Pasquini, Andrea; Bonacchi, Massimo; Zagli, Giovanni; Ciapetti, Marco; Sani, Guido; Batacchi, Stefano; Biondi, Simona; Bernardo, Pasquale; Lazzeri, Chiara; Giovannini, Valtere; Azzi, Alberta; Abbate, Rosanna; Gensini, Gianfranco; Peris, Adriano","journal":"BMC Pulm Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24ed8576ee1d7a6b01e2a5814d0df146e32d8fde.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3022902.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3022902/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzkyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO","ARDS","Emergency Service","Careggi Teaching Hospital","Intensive Care Unit","Emergency Department","PCR"],"locations":["Mexico"],"keyphrases":["ECMO treatments","H1N1 infection","H1N1-induced ARDS","early ECMO assistance","H1N1 virus","daily assessment of ARDS patients","healthy patients","lung ultrasound","bronchoalveolar lavage","PCR","experience","Lung pathology","co-infection","need of intensive care","Intensive Care Unit","pharyngeal swab samples","Emergency Service","Emergency Department","ventilation strategy","routine use of LUS","protective mechanical ventilation","Italy","decreased transportation","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","number of chest X-ray examinations","vascular access sites","effective mean","heparin infusion","radiology","CT-scan","subglottic aspiration","life threatening condition","patient safety","Florence","Careggi Teaching Hospital","Italian Ministry of Health instructions","ICU","reports","respiratory illness","transitory disconnection","cases","bleeding","Mexico","Legionella Pneumophila","blood transfusions","novel pandemic influenza","outbreak","METHODS","sensitivity","series","veno-venous","major complications","Overall mortality rate","ventilator","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","total","woman","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Yet human mobility patterns vary substantially between countries and regions. Quantifying the frequency of travel and length of journeys in well-defined population is therefore critical for predicting the likely speed and pattern of spread of emerging infectious diseases, such as a new influenza pandemic. Here we present the results of a large population survey undertaken in 2007 in two areas of China: Shenzhen city in Guangdong province, and Huangshan city in Anhui province. In each area, 10,000 randomly selected individuals were interviewed, and data on regular and occasional journeys collected. Travel behaviour was examined as a function of age, sex, economic status and home location. Women and children were generally found to travel shorter distances than men. Travel patterns in the economically developed Shenzhen region are shown to resemble those in developed and economically advanced middle income countries with a significant fraction of the population commuting over distances in excess of 50 km. Conversely, in the less developed rural region of Anhui, travel was much more local, with very few journeys over 30 km. Travel patterns in both populations were well-fitted by a gravity model with a lognormal kernel function. The results provide the first quantitative information on human travel patterns in modern China, and suggest that a pandemic emerging in a less developed area of rural China might spread geographically sufficiently slowly for containment to be feasible, while spatial spread in the more economically developed areas might be expected to be much more rapid, making containment more difficult.","publish_time":"2011-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Garske, Tini; Yu, Hongjie; Peng, Zhibin; Ye, Min; Zhou, Hang; Cheng, Xiaowen; Wu, Jiabing; Ferguson, Neil","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ca0f03f52fc023762577857285184f9777dc9a27.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4ec2396b81441bf6b11b19a271cbc96078a8f3ce.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5206b0be1000e6c8d75a827af94c1b8e61e297c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3032737.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032737/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzkyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Shenzhen","Guangdong","Anhui","China"],"keyphrases":["human travel patterns","frequency of travel","Travel behaviour","developed areas","developed area of rural China","developed Shenzhen region","developed rural region of Anhui","human mobility patterns","areas of China","spatial spread","Shenzhen city","Anhui province","modern China","length of journeys","well-defined population","occasional journeys","pandemic emerging","spread of infectious disease epidemics","results","containment","emerging infectious diseases","large population survey","Huangshan city","Guangdong province","function of age","shorter distances","lognormal kernel function","new influenza pandemic","advanced middle income countries","gravity model","sex","significant fraction","economic status","quantitative information","data","populations","home location","likely speed","selected individuals","children","excess","regions","Women"],"language":"en"},

The 1918 pandemic provides an opportunity to elucidate spatial determinants of spread on a large scale. To better characterize the spread of the 1918 major wave, we fitted a range of city-to-city transmission models to mortality data collected for 246 population centres in England and Wales and 47 cities in the US. Using a gravity model for city-to-city contacts, we explored the effect of population size and distance on the spread of disease and tested assumptions regarding density dependence in connectivity between cities. We employed Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate parameters of the model for population, infectivity, distance and density dependence. We inferred the most likely transmission trees for both countries. For England and Wales, a model that estimated the degree of density dependence in connectivity between cities was preferable by deviance information criterion comparison. Early in the major wave, long distance infective interactions predominated, with local infection events more likely as the epidemic became widespread. For the US, with fewer more widely dispersed cities, statistical power was lacking to estimate population size dependence or the degree of density dependence, with the preferred model depending on distance only. We find that parameters estimated from the England and Wales dataset can be applied to the US data with no likelihood penalty.","publish_time":"2011-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eggo, Rosalind M.; Cauchemez, Simon; Ferguson, Neil M.","journal":"J R Soc Interface","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/373811bcfe3a46dc6d49b2a1725f1dde8a59e8a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3033019.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3033019/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzkzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["England","Wales"],"keyphrases":["degree of density dependence","population size dependence","England","population centres","dispersed cities","range of city","city contacts","preferred model","spread of disease","gravity model","US data","effect of population size","city transmission models","connectivity","spatial determinants","major wave","parameters","Wales dataset","long distance infective interactions","limited understanding of key determinants of spatial spread of influenza","likely transmission trees","mortality data","Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods","tested assumptions","local infection events","deviance information criterion comparison","statistical power","infectivity","epidemic","fewer","countries","opportunity","likelihood penalty","large scale","pandemic"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Using hybridoma technology, we generated a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against recombinant human RANK receptor and characterized by SDS PAGE, ELISA, Western Blot and immunocytochemistry, then synthesized osteoclast-targeting bioconjugates of salmon calcitonin (sCT) using this antibody by generating thiol groups on mAb using 2-Iminothiolane and subsequently reacting them with sCT-PEG-MAL synthesised from sCT and NHS-PEG-MAL.

Cytotoxicity of the mAb-sCT conjugate was also evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells; sCT bioactivity and CTR binding potential were evaluated by in vitro intracellular cAMP stimulation assay in human T47D breast cancer cells. RESULTS: Generation of antibody against human RANK receptor was confirmed by SDS PAGE, ELISA and Western Blot. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the osteoclast targeting potential of the antibody.

Nearly all of the isolates (94%) were of the non-pathogenic H9N2 subtype, but viruses of the H1N2, H1N3, H3N6, H4N2, H5N1, and H10N7 subtypes were also observed. The highly pathogenic H5N1-subtype virus was observed at extremely low prevalence in the surveillance samples (0.08%), and we suggest that the current risk of infection for humans in the retail poultry markets in Bangladesh is negligible. However, the high prevalence of the H9 subtype and its potential for interaction with the highly pathogenic H5N1-subtype, i.e., reassortment and attenuation of host morbidity, highlight the importance of active surveillance of the poultry markets.","publish_time":"2011-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Negovetich, Nicholas J.; Feeroz, Mohammed M.; Jones-Engel, Lisa; Walker, David; Alam, S.

However, because infection in the vector population is quite rare in areas where control has succeeded, large numbers of flies need to be examined to certify transmission interruption. Currently, this is accomplished through PCR pool screening of large numbers of flies. The efficiency of this process is limited by the size of the pools that may be screened, which is in turn determined by the constraints imposed by the biochemistry of the assay. The current method of DNA purification from pools of vector black flies relies upon silica adsorption. This method can be applied to screen pools containing a maximum of 50 individuals (from the Latin American vectors) or 100 individuals (from the African vectors). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have evaluated an alternative method of DNA purification for pool screening of black flies which relies upon oligonucleotide capture of Onchocerca volvulus genomic DNA from homogenates prepared from pools of Latin American and African vectors. The oligonucleotide capture assay was shown to reliably detect one O. volvulus infective larva in pools containing 200 African or Latin American flies, representing a two-four fold improvement over the conventional assay. The capture assay requires an equivalent amount of technical time to conduct as the conventional assay, resulting in a two-four fold reduction in labor costs per insect assayed and reduces reagent costs to $3.81 per pool of 200 flies, or less than $0.02 per insect assayed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The oligonucleotide capture assay represents a substantial improvement in the procedure used to detect parasite prevalence in the vector population, a major metric employed in the process of certifying the elimination of onchocerciasis.","publish_time":"2012-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gopal, Hemavathi; Hassan, Hassan K.; Rodr\u00EDguez-P\u00E9rez, Mario A.; To\u00E9, Laurent D.; Lustigman, Sara; Unnasch, Thomas R.","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/123683340d6d91bf7251d4b91b7503f907dd56cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3378604.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378604/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["oligonucleotide capture assay","pools of vector black flies","Latin American flies","conventional assay","pools of Latin American","African vectors","Latin American vectors","pool screening of black flies","screen pools","oligonucleotide capture of Onchocerca volvulus genomic DNA","PCR pool screening of large numbers of flies","vector population","Onchocerca volvulus transmission","alternative method of DNA purification","current method of DNA purification","individuals","fold improvement","process","insect","Entomological surveys of Simulium vectors","volvulus infective larva","substantial improvement","labor costs","reagent costs","fold reduction","parasite prevalence","focal elimination","elimination of onchocerciasis","transmission interruption","homogenates","areas","important component","BACKGROUND","procedure","control","criteria","technical time","major metric","silica adsorption","SIGNIFICANCE","maximum","CONCLUSIONS","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","constraints","METHODOLOGY","biochemistry","infection","size","turn","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

Clara cells also function as stem/progenitor cells for repair in the bronchioles. Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) is specifically expressed in pulmonary Clara cells and is widely used as a Clara cell marker. In addition CCSP promoter is commonly used to direct gene expression into the lung in transgenic models. The discovery of CCSP immunoreactivity in plasma membranes of airway lining cells prompted us to explore the possibility of enriching Clara cells by flow cytometry. We established a novel and simple method for the isolation of CCSP-expressing cell Clara cells using a combination of mechanical and enzymatic dissociation followed by flow cytometry sorting technology. We showed that \u223C25% of dissociated cells from whole lung expressed CCSP. In the resulting preparation, up to 98% of cells expressed CCSP. Notably, we found that several common stem cell markers including CD44, CD133, Sca-1 and Sox2 were expressed in CCSP(\u002B) cells. Moreover, CCSP(\u002B) cells were able to form spheroid colonies in vitro with 0.97\u2030 efficiency. Parallel studies in vivo confirmed that a small population of CCSP(\u2212)expressing cells in mouse airways also demonstrates stem cell-like properties such as label retention and harboring rare bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) in terminal bronchioles (TBs). We conclude that CCSP(\u002B) cells exhibit a number of stem cell-like features including stem cell marker expression, bronchosphere colony formation and self-renewal ability. Clara cell isolation by flow cytometry sorting is a useful method for investigating the function of primary Clara cells in stem cell research and mouse models.","publish_time":"2012-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Xiao-Yang; Keefe, Kathleen M.; Jensen-Taubman, Sandra M.; Yang, Danlei; Yan, Kai; Linnoila, R.

We and others have also shown that Tregs express T-bet and IFN-\u03B3 at sites of Th1 inflammation and that IL-12 induces IFN-\u03B3 production by Tregs in vitro. To investigate whether loss of immunosuppression occurs when IFN-\u03B3 is expressed by Tregs we treated mouse lymphocyte cultures with IL-12. IFN-\u03B3 expression did not decrease the ability of Tregs to suppress Tconv proliferation. Rather, IL-12 treatment decreased Treg frequency and Foxp3 levels in Tregs. We further showed that IL-12 increased IL-2R expression on Tconv and CD8 T cells, diminished its expression on Tregs and decreased IL-2 production by Tconv and CD8 T cells. Together, these IL-12 mediated changes favored the outgrowth of non-Tregs. Additionally, we showed that treatment with a second cytokine, IL-27, decreased IL-2 expression without augmenting Tconv and CD8 T cell proliferation.

Natural selection has favored these viruses to be retained in the phloem to facilitate acquisition and transmission by aphids. We show that treatment of infected oat tissue homogenate with sodium sulfite reduces transmission of the purified virus by aphids. Transmission electron microscopy data indicated no gross change in virion morphology due to treatments. However, treated virions were not acquired by aphids through the hindgut epithelial cells and were not transmitted when injected directly into the hemocoel. Analysis of virus preparations using nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry revealed a number of host plant proteins co-purifying with viruses, some of which were lost following sodium sulfite treatment. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we show data suggesting that several of the virus-associated host plant proteins accumulated to higher levels in aphids that were fed on CYDV-infected plants compared to healthy plants. We propose two hypotheses to explain these observations, and these are not mutually exclusive: (a) that sodium sulfite treatment disrupts critical virion-host protein interactions required for aphid transmission, or (b) that host infection with CYDV modulates phloem protein expression in a way that is favorable for virus uptake by aphids. Importantly, the genes coding for the plant proteins associated with virus may be examined as targets in breeding cereal crops for new modes of virus resistance that disrupt phloem-virus or aphid-virus interactions.","publish_time":"2012-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cilia, Michelle; Peter, Kari A.; Bereman, Michael S.; Howe, Kevin; Fish, Tara; Smith, Dawn; Gildow, Fredrick; MacCoss, Michael J.; Thannhauser, Theodore W.; Gray, Stewart M.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c9fca01d18bac485ae1c5257a712c516aeea8408.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3484124.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3484124/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYyNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CYDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["phloem-virus","purified virus","virus uptake","aphid-virus interactions","aphids","virus-associated host plant proteins","Analysis of virus preparations","aphid transmission","cereal yellow dwarf virus","aphid proteins","new modes of virus resistance","Circulative transmission of viruses","host infection","number of host plant proteins co-purifying","following sodium sulfite treatment","critical virion-host protein interactions","CYDV-infected plants","Transmission electron microscopy data","phloem protein expression","orchestrated interactions","tandem mass spectrometry","targeted mass spectrometry","treatment of infected oat tissue homogenate","virion morphology","healthy plants","breeding cereal crops","nanoflow liquid chromatography","gross change","Luteoviridae","way","higher levels","targets","series","treatments","hindgut epithelial cells","genes coding","acquisition","treated virions","hypotheses","observations","hemocoel"],"language":"en"},

The pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor(s) binding. However, the identity of the receptor(s) is unknown. Here, by using near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification, we revealed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S1 specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157\u2013165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability in supporting both viral infections.

Despite its relevance, serum biomarkers associated with early-onset viral infection, when clinical signs are not detectable and the disease is characterized by a weak anti-viral response and persistent infection, have not yet been identified. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) is a reproducible, accurate, and simple method for the identification of biomarker proteins related to disease in serum. This work describes the SELDI-TOF MS analyses of sera of 60 PRRSV-positive and 60 PRRSV-negative, as measured by PCR, asymptomatic Large White piglets at weaning. Sera with comparable and low content of hemoglobin (\u003C 4.52 \u03BCg/mL) were fractionated in 6 different fractions by anion-exchange chromatography and protein profiles in the mass range 1\u2013200 kDa were obtained with the CM10, IMAC30, and H50 surfaces. RESULTS: A total of 200 significant peaks (p \u003C 0.05) were identified in the initial discovery phase of the study and 47 of them were confirmed in the validation phase. The majority of peaks (42) were up-regulated in PRRSV-positive piglets, while 5 were down-regulated. A panel of 14 discriminatory peaks identified in fraction 1 (pH = 9), on the surface CM10, and acquired at low focus mass provided a serum protein profile diagnostic pattern that enabled to discriminate between PRRSV-positive and -negative piglets with a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 73%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SELDI-TOF MS profiling of sera from PRRSV-positive and PRRSV-negative asymptomatic piglets provided a proteomic signature with large scale diagnostic potential for early identification of PRRSV infection in weaning piglets. Furthermore, SELDI-TOF protein markers represent a refined phenotype of PRRSV infection that might be useful for whole genome association studies.","publish_time":"2012-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Genini, Sem; Paternoster, Thomas; Costa, Alessia; Botti, Sara; Luini, Mario Vittorio; Caprera, Andrea; Giuffra, Elisabetta","journal":"Proteome Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da9c223fd6f69816aca093a7d2ab333fe9b21ee1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3492009.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3492009/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Sera"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PRRSV-positive piglets","PRRSV-negative asymptomatic piglets","early identification of PRRSV infection","negative piglets","refined phenotype of PRRSV infection","weaning piglets","SELDI-TOF protein markers","SELDI-TOF MS profiling of sera","SELDI-TOF MS analyses of sera","asymptomatic Large White piglets","persistent infection","significant peaks","early-onset viral infection","protein profiles","mass range","low focus mass","serum protein profile diagnostic pattern","serum biomarkers","surface CM10","discriminatory peaks","majority of peaks","large scale diagnostic potential","validation phase","Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry","identification of biomarker proteins","low content of hemoglobin","initial discovery phase","significant swine diseases","weak anti-viral response","proteomic signature","anion-exchange chromatography","simple method","clinical signs","respiratory syndrome","PCR","BACKGROUND","different fractions","total","CONCLUSIONS","genome association studies","study","IMAC30","H50 surfaces","kDa","relevance","sensitivity","specificity","work","\u03BCg","RESULTS","panel"],"language":"en"},

B-cell epitopes on the gp90 protein of REV have not been well studied and reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study describes the identification of a linear B-cell epitope on the gp90 protein by screening a phage-displayed 12-mer random peptide library with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) A9E8 directed against the gp90. The mAb A9E8 recognized phages displaying peptides with the consensus motif SVQYHPL. Amino acid sequence of the motif exactly matched (213)SVQYHPL(219) of the gp90. Further identification of the displayed B cell epitope was conducted using a set of truncated peptides expressed as GST fusion proteins and the Western blot results indicated that (213)SVQYHPL(219) was the minimal determinant of the linear B cell epitope recognized by the mAb A9E8. Moreover, an eight amino acid peptide SVQYHPLA was proven to be the minimal unit of the epitope with the maximal binding activity to mAb A9E8. The REV-A-positive chicken serum reacted with the minimal linear epitopes in Western blot, revealing the importance of the eight amino acids of the epitope in antibody-epitope binding activity. Furthermore, we found that the epitope is a common motif shared among REV-A and other members of REV group. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: We identified (213)SVQYHPL(219) as a gp90-specific linear B-cell epitope recognized by the neutralizing mAb A9E8. The results in this study may have potential applications in development of diagnostic techniques and epitope-based marker vaccines against REV-A and other viruses of the REV group.","publish_time":"2012-11-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xue, Mei; Shi, Xingming; Zhang, Jing; Zhao, Yan; Cui, Hongyu; Hu, Shunlei; Gao, Hongbo; Cui, Xianlan; Wang, Yun-Feng","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cc12d028d0f63383a4243bb73d76f70ae229daa.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3504085.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3504085/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GST"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["linear B cell epitope","gp90 protein of REV","displayed B cell epitope","gp90-specific linear B-cell epitope","antibody-epitope binding activity","B-cell epitopes","neutralizing mAb A9E8","members of REV group","epitope-based marker vaccines","minimal linear epitopes","consensus motif SVQYHPL","Western blot results","gp90 protein of avian reticuloendotheliosis-associated virus","neutralizing monoclonal antibody","minimal determinant","minimal unit","identification","study","amino acid peptide SVQYHPLA","amino acids","common motif","Amino acid sequence","maximal binding activity","protective antibody immune responses","set of truncated peptides","mer random peptide library","development of diagnostic techniques","GST fusion proteins","potential applications","positive chicken serum","phages","animals","importance","important envelope glycoprotein","BACKGROUND","viruses","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","SIGNIFICANCE"],"language":"en"},

However, when activated microglia assume diverse phenotypes ranging from fully inflamed, which involves the release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, to alternatively activated, releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines or neurotrophins, the consequences to neurons can range from detrimental to supportive. Due to the different experimental sets and conditions, contradictory results have been obtained regarding the controversial question of whether microglia are \u201Cgood\u201D or \u201Cbad.\u201D While it is well understood that the dual roles of activated microglia depend on specific situations, the underlying mechanisms have remained largely unclear, and the interpretation of certain findings related to diverse microglial phenotypes continues to be problematic.

Hypercytokinemia is the principal immunopathological mechanism that contributes to a severer clinical course in cases of influenza A/H1N1. The benefit produced, or damage caused, by these cytokines in severe disease is not known. The genes that code for these molecules are polymorphic and certain alleles have been associated with susceptibility to various diseases. The objective of the present study was to determine whether there was an association between polymorphisms of TNF, LTA, IL1B, IL6, IL8, and CCL1 and the infection and severity of the illness caused by the pandemic A/H1N1 in Mexico in 2009. METHODS: Case\u2013control study. The cases were patients confirmed with real time PCR with infection by the A/H1N1 pandemic virus. The controls were patients with infection like to influenza and non-familial healthy contacts of the patients with influenza. Medical history and outcome of the disease was registered. The DNA samples were genotyped for polymorphisms TNF rs361525, rs1800629, and rs1800750; LTA rs909253; IL1B rs16944; IL6 rs1818879; IL8 rs4073; and CCL1 rs2282691. Odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated. The logistic regression model was adjusted by age and severity of the illness in cases. RESULTS: Infection with the pandemic A/H1N1 virus was associated with the following genotypes: TNF rs361525 AA, OR = 27.00; 95% CI = 3.07\u20131248.77); LTA rs909253 AG (OR = 4.33, 95% CI = 1.82\u201310.32); TNF rs1800750 AA (OR = 4.33, 95% CI = 1.48\u201312.64); additionally, LTA rs909253 AG showed a limited statistically significant association with mortality (p = 0.06, OR = 3.13). Carriers of the TNF rs1800629 GA genotype were associated with high levels of blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.05); those of the TNF rs1800750 AA genotype, with high levels of creatine phosphokinase (p=0.05).

Since its discovery in November 2011, SBV has spread very rapidly to many European countries. Here, we developed molecular and serological tools, and an experimental in vivo model as a platform to study SBV pathogenesis, tropism and virus-host cell interactions. Using a synthetic biology approach, we developed a reverse genetics system for the rapid rescue and genetic manipulation of SBV. We showed that SBV has a wide tropism in cell culture and \u201Csynthetic\u201D SBV replicates in vitro as efficiently as wild type virus. We developed an experimental mouse model to study SBV infection and showed that this virus replicates abundantly in neurons where it causes cerebral malacia and vacuolation of the cerebral cortex. These virus-induced acute lesions are useful in understanding the progression from vacuolation to porencephaly and extensive tissue destruction, often observed in aborted lambs and calves in naturally occurring Schmallenberg cases. Indeed, we detected high levels of SBV antigens in the neurons of the gray matter of brain and spinal cord of naturally affected lambs and calves, suggesting that muscular hypoplasia observed in SBV-infected lambs is mostly secondary to central nervous system damage. Finally, we investigated the molecular determinants of SBV virulence. Interestingly, we found a biological SBV clone that after passage in cell culture displays increased virulence in mice. We also found that a SBV deletion mutant of the non-structural NSs protein (SBV\u0394NSs) is less virulent in mice than wild type SBV. Attenuation of SBV virulence depends on the inability of SBV\u0394NSs to block IFN synthesis in virus infected cells.

It extends the time frame of effective mitigation, especially when the characteristics of the emerging virus are unknown. In the present study, we used the 2009 influenza A pandemic as a case study to evaluate the impact of regulating air, sea, and land transport. Other government strategies, namely, antivirals and hospitalizations, were also evaluated. METHODS: Hong Kong arrivals from 44 countries via air, sea, and land transports were imported into a discrete stochastic Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Recovered (SEIR) host-flow model. The model allowed a number of latent and infectious cases to pass the border, which constitutes a source of local disease transmission. We also modeled antiviral and hospitalization prevention strategies to compare the effectiveness of these control measures. Baseline reproduction rate was estimated from routine surveillance data. RESULTS: Regarding air travel, the main route connected to the influenza source area should be targeted for travel restrictions; imposing a 99% air travel restriction delayed the epidemic peak by up to two weeks. Once the pandemic was established in China, the strong land connection between Hong Kong and China rendered Hong Kong vulnerable. Antivirals and hospitalization were found to be more effective on attack rate reductions than travel restrictions. Combined strategies (with 99% restriction on all transport modes) deferred the peak for long enough to establish a vaccination program. CONCLUSION: The findings will assist policy-makers with decisions on handling similar future pandemics. We also suggest regulating the extent of restriction and the transport mode, once restriction has been deemed necessary for pandemic control. Although travel restrictions have yet to gain social acceptance, they allow time for mitigation response when a new and highly intrusive virus emerges.","publish_time":"2012-11-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chong, Ka Chun; Ying Zee, Benny Chung","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b4d56c6c289c7f86b4f01b1b5569ae7e2bf6920.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e3090e4e8baa6df559f0299519ad77821a09f873.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3577649.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3577649/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong","China"],"keyphrases":["air travel restriction","travel restrictions","new influenza pandemic","extent of restriction","pandemic control","Hong Kong arrivals","Hong Kong vulnerable","China","influenza source area","land transports","hospitalization prevention strategies","transport modes","government strategies","Combined strategies","antivirals","time frame of effective mitigation","strong land connection","infectious cases","mitigation response","epidemic peak","case study","emerging virus","intrusive virus","present study","control measures","attack rate reductions","Baseline reproduction rate","host-flow model","source of local disease transmission","non-pharmaceutical means of retarding incidence growth","decisions","policy-makers","main route","handling similar future pandemics","characteristics","effectiveness","early stages","countries","routine surveillance data","SEIR","number of latent","impact","social acceptance","findings","border","METHODS","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","weeks","hospitalizations","RESULTS","vaccination program"],"language":"en"},

An on-line screening registry allowed a daily report of ICU beds occupancy rate by flu infected patients (Flu-OR) admitted in French ICUs. METHODS: We conducted a prospective inception cohort study with results of an on-line screening registry designed for daily assessment of ICU burden. RESULTS: Among the 108 centers participating to the French H1N1 research network on mechanical ventilation (REVA) - French Society of Intensive Care (SRLF) registry, 69 ICUs belonging to seven large geographical areas voluntarily participated in a website screening-registry. The aim was to daily assess the ICU beds occupancy rate by influenza-infected and non-infected patients for at least three weeks. Three hundred ninety-one critically ill infected patients were enrolled in the cohort, representing a subset of 35% of the whole French 2009 pandemic cohort; 73% were mechanically ventilated, 13% required extra corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22% died. The global Flu-OR in these ICUs was only 7.6%, but it exceeded a predefined 15% critical threshold in 32 ICUs for a total of 103 weeks. Flu-ORs were significantly higher in University than in non-University hospitals. The peak ICU burden was poorly predicted by observations obtained at the level of large geographical areas. CONCLUSIONS: The peak Flu-OR during the pandemic significantly exceeded a 15% critical threshold in almost half of the ICUs, with an uneven distribution with time, geographical areas and between University and non-University hospitals. An on-line assessment of Flu-OR via a simple dedicated registry may contribute to better match resources and needs.","publish_time":"2012-07-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richard, Jean-Christophe Marie; Pham, T\u00E0i; Brun-Buisson, Christian; Reignier, Jean; Mercat, Alain; Beduneau, Ga\u00EBtan; R\u00E9gnier, Bernard; Mourvillier, Bruno; Guitton, Christophe; Castanier, Matthias; Combes, Alain; Tulzo, Yves Le; Brochard, Laurent","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/657934c675786123c27a83387ef477eb93365ae0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3580695.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3580695/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzczMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care Units","ICU","University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["French ICUs","flu infected patients","peak Flu","on-line screening registry","on-line assessment of Flu","Flu-ORs","global Flu","non-infected patients","influenza-infected","non-University hospitals","daily assessment of ICU burden","website screening-registry","peak ICU burden","pandemic cohort","ill infected patients","daily report of ICU beds occupancy rate","simple dedicated registry","French Society of Intensive Care","level of large geographical areas","French H1N1 research network","H1N1 influenza","specific burden","results","critical threshold","weeks","Intensive Care Units","prospective inception cohort study","mechanical ventilation","REVA","SRLF","better match resources","time","uneven distribution","centers","observations","corporal membrane oxygenation","ECMO","needs","total","half","METHODS","INTRODUCTION","CONCLUSIONS","subset","aim"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published literature available in the public domain. We conducted a quality assessment of all eligible studies according to GRADE criteria and performed a meta-analysis to report the odds ratios for all risk factors identified in these studies. RESULTS: We identified 36 studies that investigated 19 risk factors for severe ALRI. Of these, 7 risk factors were significantly associated with severe ALRI in a consistent manner across studies, with the following meta-analysis estimates of odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals): low birth weight 3.18 (1.02-9.90), lack of exclusive breastfeeding 2.34 (1.42-3.88), crowding \u2013 more than 7 persons per household 1.96 (1.53-2.52), exposure to indoor air pollution 1.57 (1.06-2.31), incomplete immunization 1.83 (1.32-2.52), undernutrition \u2013 weight-for-age less than 2 standard deviations 4.47 (2.10-9.49), and HIV infection 4.15 (2.57-9.74).

The mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection are poorly understood. In 2010, 108 DENV3-positive cases were enrolled in a pediatric hospital-based study in Managua, Nicaragua, with 61 primary and 47 secondary infections. We analyzed DENV-specific neutralization titers (NT(50)), IgM and IgG avidity, and antibody titer in serum samples collected during acute and convalescent phases and 3, 6, and 18 months post-infection. NT(50) titers peaked at convalescence and decreased thereafter. IgG avidity to DENV3 significantly increased between convalescent and 3-month time-points in primary DENV infections and between the acute and convalescent phase in secondary DENV infections. While avidity to DENV2, a likely previous infecting serotype, was initially higher than avidity to DENV3 in secondary DENV infections, the opposite relation was observed 3\u201318 months post-infection. We found significant correlations between IgM avidity and NT(50) in acute primary cases and between IgG avidity and NT(50) in secondary DENV infections. In summary, our findings indicate that IgM antibodies likely play a role in early control of DENV infections. IgG serum avidity to DENV, analyzed for the first time in longitudinal samples, switches from targeting mainly cross-reactive serotype(s) to the current infecting serotype over time. Finally, serum avidity correlates with neutralization capacity.","publish_time":"2013-06-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Puschnik, Andreas; Lau, Louis; Cromwell, Elizabeth A.; Balmaseda, Angel; Zompi, Simona; Harris, Eva","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/339f0cd12ca08506c22c8b62eb4b3283a437271a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3681624.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3681624/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["secondary DENV infections","primary DENV infections","IgG avidity","IgM avidity","IgG serum avidity","majority of secondary infections","early control of DENV infections","serum avidity correlates","heterotypic secondary infection","DENV-specific neutralization titers","acute primary cases","serum samples","months post-infection","current infecting serotype","cross-reactive serotype","convalescent phases","likely previous infecting serotype","IgM antibodies","DENV3-positive cases","month time-points","antibody titer","longitudinal samples","mechanisms of antibody","neutralization capacity","Managua","role","pediatric hospital-based study","switches","DENV2","dengue virus","severe disease","opposite relation","Nicaragua","significant correlations","mediated protection","findings","summary","convalescence"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The consecutive medical records of neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies who were admitted to the Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center between April 2009 and July 2012, and who were subsequently diagnosed with VSB were reviewed retrospectively. A comparison was made between the clinical and laboratory characteristics of adults and pediatric patients and also between patients with cefepime susceptible or not susceptible VSB. RESULTS: A total of 202 episodes (141 in adults, 61 in children) of VSB were identified. Among them, 26 (12.9%) cases had severe complications including four (2.0%) cases of death attributable to VSB. For antibacterial prophylaxis, most adults received ciprofloxacin (97.1%), but children more frequently received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (86.9%). Oral mucositis (p = 0.005) and abdominal pain (p = 0.001) were found more frequently in adults, and cough was found more frequently in children (p = 0.004). The occurrence rates of severe complications and death attributable to VSB were not significantly different between adults and children. Susceptibility rate to cefepime was significantly higher in adults than children (85.7% vs. 66.1%, p = 0.002). However, in multivariate analysis, cefepime susceptibility had no impact on clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in clinical outcome between adults and children with VSB despite a difference in cefepime susceptibility. Hence, different antibiotic treatment strategies may not be necessary.","publish_time":"2013-06-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Seung Beom; Bae, E Young; Lee, Jae Wook; Lee, Dong-Gun; Chung, Nack-Gyun; Jeong, Dae-Chul; Cho, Bin; Kang, Jin Han; Kim, Hack-Ki","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2c34d85b18c563aa9373177c62d5a05e93a5426e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3685537.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3685537/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center","VSB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["children","susceptible VSB","febrile neutropenic adults","laboratory characteristics of adults","cefepime susceptibility","clinical characteristics","clinical outcome","cefepime susceptible","pediatric patients","hematologic malignancies","cases of death attributable","Susceptibility rate","consecutive medical records of neutropenic patients","significant difference","different antibiotic treatment strategies","occurrence rates of severe complications","antibiotic susceptibilities of viridans streptococcal bacteremia","impact","Catholic Blood","Marrow Transplantation Center","multivariate analysis","METHODS","episodes","antibacterial prophylaxis","ciprofloxacin","abdominal pain","RESULTS","total","CONCLUSIONS","Oral mucositis","study","trimethoprim","sulfamethoxazole","cough","BACKGROUND","comparison"],"language":"en"},

However, few of these networks have been delineated completely. Towards this end, quantitative phosphoproteomics is emerging as a useful tool enabling large-scale determination of relative phosphorylation levels. However, phosphoproteomics differs from classical proteomics by a more extensive sampling limitation due to the limited number of detectable sites per protein. Here, we propose a comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline customized for phosphoproteome data from interventional experiments for identifying key proteins in specific pathways, discovering the protein-protein interactions and inferring the signaling network. We also made an effort to partially compensate for the missing value problem, a chronic issue for proteomics studies. The dataset used for this study was generated using SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture) technique with interventional experiments (kinase-dead mutations). The major components of the pipeline include phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis and causal relationship discovery. We have successfully applied our pipeline to interventional experiments identifying phosphorylation events underlying the transition to a filamentous growth form in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified 5 high-confidence proteins from meta-analysis, and 19 hub proteins from correlation analysis (Pbi2p and Hsp42p were identified by both analyses). All these proteins are involved in stress responses. Nine of them have direct or indirect evidence of involvement in filamentous growth. In addition, we tested four of our predicted proteins, Nth1p, Pbi2p, Pdr12p and Rcn2p, by interventional phenotypic experiments and all of them present differential invasive growth, providing prospective validation of our approach. This comprehensive pipeline presents a systematic way for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest candidate proteins for further investigation. We anticipate the methodology to be applicable as well to other interventional studies via different experimental platforms.","publish_time":"2013-06-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Yan; Kweon, Hye Kyong; Shively, Christian; Kumar, Anuj; Andrews, Philip C.","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e0531f9c84005ac77b1bdb3075c486e6ac116760.json; document_parses/pdf_json/7c73591901ddde49d3ebba7410f2e2da1ceb6707.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3694812.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694812/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interventional experiments","interventional studies","interventional phenotypic experiments","correlation analysis","key proteins","hub proteins","candidate proteins","predicted proteins","interventional phosphoproteome data","comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline","correlation network analysis","comprehensive pipeline","networks","phosphopeptide meta-analysis","high-confidence proteins","filamentous growth form","protein-protein interactions","critical regulators of cell growth","Pbi2p","phosphorylation events","proteomics studies","Reversible phosphorylation","quantitative phosphoproteomics","present differential invasive growth","Cell culture","classical proteomics","major components","large-scale determination of relative phosphorylation levels","major mechanisms of signal transduction","technique","Amino acids","chronic issue","useful tool","Rcn2p","Pdr12p","transition","prospective validation","extensive sampling limitation","limited number of detectable sites","causal relationship discovery","Stable Isotope","indirect evidence of involvement","Nth1p","specific pathways","missing value problem","systematic way","kinase-dead mutations","SILAC","Saccharomyces cerevisiae","development","different experimental platforms","Hsp42p","study","approach","end","stress responses","investigation","dataset","methodology","effort","analyses","addition"],"language":"en"},

The past decade has witnessed rapid expansion of receptor families identified to employ TRAFs for signaling. These include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), T cell receptor, IL-1 receptor family, IL-17 receptors, IFN receptors and TGF\u03B2 receptors. In addition to their role as adaptor proteins, most TRAFs also act as E3 ubiquitin ligases to activate downstream signaling events. TRAF-dependent signaling pathways typically lead to the activation of nuclear factor-\u03BABs (NF-\u03BABs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), or interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs). Compelling evidence obtained from germ-line and cell-specific TRAF-deficient mice demonstrates that each TRAF plays indispensable and non-redundant physiological roles, regulating innate and adaptive immunity, embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, stress response, and bone metabolism. Notably, mounting evidence implicates TRAFs in the pathogenesis of human diseases such as cancers and autoimmune diseases, which has sparked new appreciation and interest in TRAF research.

In this study, we investigated the potential of lysozyme-treated Enterococcus faecalis FK-23 (LFK) to prevent influenza in influenza virus-infected mice. C57BL/6N mice were orally administered LFK and intranasally infected with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) at lethal doses. After infection with influenza A virus, the survival rate of the LFK-administered mice was significantly higher than that of saline-administered mice. Staining of lung sections with hematoxylin-eosin, and cell counts of lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed that oral administration of LFK suppressed the excessive infiltration of leukocytes into the lung after viral infection. Extravasation assay revealed that the arrest was mediated by modulation of pulmonary alveolar-capillary permeability. Expression levels of genes involved in matrix degradation, which are correlated with vascular permeability, were downregulated in LFK-administered mice. These findings suggest that stabilizing the integrity of the alveolar-capillary barrier by the administration of LFK improves survival rate.

HRV is classified into three species within the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. HRV species A and B contain 75 and 25 serotypes identified by cross-neutralization assays, although the use of such assays for routine HRV typing is hampered by the large number of serotypes, replacement of virus isolation by molecular methods in HRV diagnosis and the poor or absent replication of HRV species C in cell culture. To address these problems, we propose an alternative, genotypic classification of HRV-based genetic relatedness analogous to that used for enteroviruses. Nucleotide distances between 384 complete VP1 sequences of currently assigned HRV (sero)types identified divergence thresholds of 13, 12 and 13 % for species A, B and C, respectively, that divided inter- and intra-type comparisons. These were paralleled by 10, 9.5 and 10 % thresholds in the larger dataset of \u003E3800 VP4 region sequences. Assignments based on VP1 sequences led to minor revisions of existing type designations (such as the reclassification of serotype pairs, e.g. A8/A95 and A29/A44, as single serotypes) and the designation of new HRV types A101\u2013106, B101\u2013103 and C34\u2013C51. A protocol for assignment and numbering of new HRV types using VP1 sequences and the restriction of VP4 sequence comparisons to type identification and provisional type assignments is proposed. Genotypic assignment and identification of HRV types will be of considerable value in the future investigation of type-associated differences in disease outcomes, transmission and epidemiology.","publish_time":"2013-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"McIntyre, Chloe L.; Knowles, Nick J.; Simmonds, Peter","journal":"J Gen Virol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4afc459e347836f0f92a75ab0c6cbe2e02e6f3a4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3749525.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3749525/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HRV diagnosis","assigned HRV","identification of HRV types","genotypic classification of HRV","numbering of new HRV types","routine HRV typing","designation of new HRV types A101","absent replication of HRV species C","complete VP1 sequences","intra-type comparisons","provisional type assignments","VP4 region sequences","future investigation of type","single serotypes","Genotypic assignment","minor revisions of existing type designations","large number of serotypes","disease outcomes","restriction of VP4 sequence comparisons","divergence thresholds","severe disease manifestations","cross-neutralization assays","associated differences","replacement of virus isolation","mild upper respiratory tract infections","molecular methods","A8","considerable value","HRVs","A95","bronchiolitis","transmission","A29","A44","B101","genetic relatedness analogous","larger dataset","reclassification of serotype pairs","cell culture","genus Enterovirus","Nucleotide distances","alternative","asthma exacerbations","family Picornaviridae","epidemiology","protocol","Human rhinoviruses","C34","C51","enteroviruses","problems"],"language":"en"},

In this protein, a post-translational modification by fatty acids covalently attached to cysteine, termed S-palmitoylation, plays a crucial role for the antiviral activity. IFITM3 possesses three cysteine residues for the S-palmitoylation in the first transmembrane (TM1) domain and in the cytoplasmic (CP) loop. Because these cysteines are well conserved in the mammalian IFITM family proteins, the S-palmitoylation on these cysteines is significant for their functions. IFITM5 is another IFITM family protein and interacts with the FK506-binding protein 11 (FKBP11) to form a higher-order complex in osteoblast cells, which induces the expression of immunologically relevant genes. In this study, we investigated the role played by S-palmitoylation of IFITM5 in its interaction with FKBP11 in the cells, because this interaction is a key process for the gene expression. Our investigations using an established reporter, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA), and an inhibitor for the S-palmitoylation, 2-bromopalmitic acid (2BP), revealed that IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated in addition to IFITM3. Specifically, we found that cysteine residues in the TM1 domain and in the CP loop were S-palmitoylated in IFITM5. Then, we revealed by immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses that the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 was inhibited in the presence of 2BP. The mutant lacking the S-palmitoylation site in the TM1 domain lost the interaction with FKBP11. These results indicate that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 promotes the interaction with FKBP11. Finally, we investigated bone nodule formation in osteoblast cells in the presence of 2BP, because IFITM5 was originally identified as a bone formation factor. The experiment resulted in a morphological aberration of the bone nodule. This also indicated that the S-palmitoylation contributes to bone formation.","publish_time":"2013-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsukamoto, Takashi; Li, Xianglan; Morita, Hiromi; Minowa, Takashi; Aizawa, Tomoyasu; Hanagata, Nobutaka; Demura, Makoto","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d8784d230453109b9340461f2692f0f2d048927.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3776769.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3776769/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzkyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S-palmitoylation site","termed S-palmitoylation","interaction of IFITM5","FKBP11","TM1 domain","bone nodule formation","IFITM3","bone formation factor","osteoblast cells","cysteine residues","mammalian IFITM family proteins","CP loop","presence","cysteines","FK506-binding protein","crucial role","octadecynoic acid","bromopalmitic acid","antiviral activity","gene expression","influenza","fatty acids","post-translational modification","western blot analyses","higher-order complex","established reporter","H1N1","important target","morphological aberration","key process","virus infection","immunoprecipitation","ODYA","inhibitor","mutant","addition","investigations","experiment","relevant genes","functions","interferon","results","study"],"language":"en"},

We generated Huh-7-derived cell lines resistant to brefeldin A (BFA), which is an inhibitor of this pathway. The resistant cell lines could be sorted into two phenotypes regarding BFA-induced toxicity, inhibition of albumin secretion, and inhibition of HCV infection. Two cell lines were more than 100 times more resistant to BFA than the parental Huh-7 cells in these 3 assays. This resistant phenotype was correlated with the presence of a point mutation in the Sec7 domain of GBF1, which is known to impair the binding of BFA. Surprisingly, the morphology of the cis-Golgi of these cells remained sensitive to BFA at concentrations of the drug that allowed albumin secretion, indicating a dichotomy between the phenotypes of secretion and Golgi morphology. Cells of the second group were about 10 times more resistant than parental Huh-7 cells to the BFA-induced toxicity. The EC(50) for albumin secretion was only 1.5\u20131.8 fold higher in these cells than in Huh-7 cells. However their level of secretion in the presence of inhibitory doses of BFA was 5 to 15 times higher. Despite this partially effective secretory pathway in the presence of BFA, the HCV infection was almost as sensitive to BFA as in Huh-7 cells. This suggests that the function of GBF1 in HCV replication does not simply reflect its role of regulator of the secretory pathway of the host cell. Thus, our results confirm the involvement of GBF1 in HCV replication, and suggest that GBF1 might fulfill another function, in addition to the regulation of the secretory pathway, during HCV replication.","publish_time":"2013-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Farhat, Rayan; Goueslain, Lucie; Wychowski, Czeslaw; Belouzard, Sandrine; F\u00E9n\u00E9ant, Lucie; Jackson, Catherine L.; Dubuisson, Jean; Rouill\u00E9, Yves","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4bd41e4fe399ecfd7456792b11f51979999b4d1e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3776844.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3776844/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzkyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cells","presence of BFA","HCV replication","binding of BFA","BFA-induced toxicity","resistant cell lines","phenotypes of secretion","presence of inhibitory doses of BFA","function of GBF1","inhibition of albumin secretion","inhibition of HCV infection","derived cell lines resistant","level of secretion","effective secretory pathway","involvement of GBF1","GBF1-Arf1","resistant phenotype","host cell","times higher","Sec7 domain of GBF1","Golgi morphology","replication of hepatitis C virus","cis-Golgi","fold higher","concentrations","brefeldin","point mutation","regulation","drug","dichotomy","role of regulator","addition","COP","group","Recent reports","results","assays"],"language":"en"},

Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) has been reported as a target to regulate macrophage polarization. The present work was designed to investigate the therapeutic potential of MR antagonism in bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and fibrosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We first demonstrated the expression of MR in magnetic bead-purified Ly6G-/CD11b\u002B circulating monocytes and in alveolar macrophages harvested in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from C57BL/6 mice. Then, a pharmacological intervention study using spironolactone (20mg/kg/day by oral gavage) revealed that MR antagonism led to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine production (downregulated monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, transforming growth factor \u03B21, and interleukin-1\u03B2 at mRNA and protein levels) and collagen deposition (decreased lung total hydroxyproline content and collagen positive area by Masson\u2019 trichrome staining) in bleomycin treated (2.5mg/kg, via oropharyngeal instillation) male C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, serial flow cytometry analysis in blood, BALF and enzymatically digested lung tissue, revealed that spironolactone could partially inhibit bleomycin-induced circulating Ly6C(hi) monocyte expansion, and reduce alternative activation (F4/80\u002BCD11c\u002BCD206\u002B) of mononuclear phagocyte in alveoli, whereas the phenotype of interstitial macrophage (F4/80\u002BCD11c-) remained unaffected by spironolactone during investigation.

Rapid identification, epidemiologic surveillance, and mitigation of transmission are major challenges in ensuring public health safety. Here we describe a powerful new approach for infectious disease surveillance that is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify nucleic acid targets from large groupings of organisms, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI\u2010MS) for accurate mass measurements of the PCR products, and base composition signature analysis to identify organisms in a sample. This approach is capable of automated analysis of more than 1,500 PCR reactions a day. It is applicable to the surveillance of bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal pathogens and will facilitate rapid characterization of known and emerging pathogens.","publish_time":"2007-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"SAMPATH, RANGARAJAN; HALL, THOMAS A.; MASSIRE, CHRISTIAN; LI, FENG; BLYN, LAWRENCE B.; ESHOO, MARK W.; HOFSTADLER, STEVEN A.; ECKER, DAVID J.","journal":"Ann N Y Acad Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bc0b69d4de776320a5d83008c8b864e9161de3ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167958.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167958/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR"],"locations":["Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["PCR products","infectious disease surveillance","epidemiologic surveillance","surveillance of bacterial","PCR reactions","emerging diseases","emerging pathogens","emergent infectious diseases","public health safety","global public health problem","protozoal pathogens","rapid characterization","Rapid identification","large groupings of organisms","accurate mass measurements","capable of automated analysis","powerful new approach","electrospray ionization mass spectrometry","base composition signature analysis","ESI","major challenges","mitigation of transmission","nucleic acid targets","avian influenza","H5N1","SARS","epicenter","population dense regions of Southeast Asia","polymerase chain reaction","Dengue","outbreak of Nipah","enterovirus","past decade","day","sample"],"language":"en"},

The immunopathogenesis of demyelination must involve neuritogenic components in myelin. The various antigens suspected to play a role in HIV\u2010seronegative IDPN include (i) P(2) protein; (ii) sulfatide (GalS); (iii) various gangliosides (especially GM(1)); (iv) galactocerebroside (GalC); and (v) glycoproteins or glycolipids with the carbohydrate epitope glucuronyl\u20103\u2010sulfate. These glycoproteins or glycolipids may be individually targeted, or an immune attack may be raised against a combination of any of these epitopes. The glycolipids, however, especially GalS, have recently evoked much interest as mediators of immune events underlying both non\u2010HIV and HIV\u2010associated demyelinating neuropathies.

We included children aged 2\u201316 years with active asthma, defined as three or more recurrent episodes of reversible wheezing. The severity of asthma and of asthmatic exacerbations was recorded. Immunofluorescence assays (IFA) on nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS), serological tests, or both, were used for detection of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on NPS were used for rhinovirus and enterovirus. Serological tests for Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were performed. A control group of asymptomatic asthmatic outpatients was examined for respiratory viruses (using IFA and PCR). Eighty\u2010two symptomatic children (mean age, 7.9 years) were examined. Viruses were detected in 38% (enterovirus, 15.8%; rhinovirus, 12%; RSV, 7.3%). Serological tests for atypical bacteria were positive in 10% of patients (C. pneumoniae, 5%; M. pneumoniae, 5%). Among the 27 control subjects (mean age, 7.9 years), one PCR was positive for enterovirus. There was no correlation between severity of chronic asthma or asthmatic exacerbations and the diagnosis of infection. Atypical bacterial pathogen infections were linked with prolonged asthmatic symptoms. In conclusion, we confirmed the high incidence of viral infection in acute exacerbations of asthma, especially enteroviruses or rhinoviruses. Persistent clinical features were more frequently associated with atypical bacterial infections, suggesting that these infections should be investigated and treated in cases of persistent asthmatic symptoms.

In this study, a detailed in silico analysis of the ORF1ab, encoding the 7,182\u2010amino acid replicase polyprotein in the CoV\u2010HKU1 genome showed that the replicase polyprotein of CoV\u2010HKU1 is cleaved by its papain\u2010like proteases and 3C\u2010like protease (3CL(pro)) into 16 polypeptides homologous to the corresponding polypeptides in other coronaviruses. Surprisingly, analysis of the putative cleavage sites of the 3CL(pro) revealed a unique putative cleavage site. In all known coronaviruses, the P1 positions at the cleavage sites of the 3CL(pro) are occupied by glutamine. This is also observed in CoV\u2010HKU1, except for one site at the junction between nsp10 (helicase) and nsp11 (member of exonuclease family), where the P1 position is occupied by histidine. This amino acid substitution is due to a single nucleotide mutation in the CoV\u2010HKU1 genome, CAG/A to CAT. This probably represents a novel cleavage site because the same mutation was consistently observed in CoV\u2010HKU1 sequences from multiple specimens of different patients; the P2 and P1\u2032\u2010P12\u2032 positions of this cleavage site are consistent between CoV\u2010HKU1 and other coronaviruses; and as the helicase is one of the most conserved proteins in coronaviruses, cleavage between nsp10 and nsp11 should be an essential step for the generation of the mature functional helicase. Experiments, including purification and C\u2010terminal amino acid sequencing of the CoV\u2010HKU1 helicase and trans\u2010cleavage assays of the CoV\u2010HKU1 3CL(pro) will confirm the presence of this novel cleavage site.","publish_time":"2013-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woo, Patrick C.Y.; Huang, Yi; Lau, Susanna K.P.; Tsoi, Hoi\u2010wah; Yuen, Kwok\u2010yung","journal":"Microbiol Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/53c5dd5166b71eb75d2d7850e40aff428e91156e.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CAG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HKU1 helicase","HKU1 genome","coronavirus HKU1","HKU1 sequences","novel cleavage site","replicase polyprotein of CoV","putative cleavage sites","unique putative cleavage site","trans\u2010cleavage assays","novel coronavirus","P1 positions","amino acid replicase polyprotein","known coronaviruses","amino acid substitution","nsp11","terminal amino acid sequencing","nsp10","mature functional helicase","complete genome sequence","polypeptides homologous","corresponding polypeptides","silico analysis","single nucleotide mutation","multiple specimens of different patients","P2","generation","purification","P12","pneumonia","member of exonuclease family","essential step","ORF1ab","conserved proteins","CAG","presence","proteases","study","discovery","papain","junction","Experiments","histidine","glutamine"],"language":"en"},

Screening to detect a potential SARS infected person plays an important role in preventing the spread of SARS. The use of infrared thermal imaging cameras has been proposed as a noninvasive, speedy, cost effective and fairly accurate means for mass blind screening of potential SARS infected persons. Infrared thermography provides a digital image showing temperature patterns. This has been previously utilized in the detection of inflammation and nerve dysfunctions. It is believed that IR cameras can potentially be used to detect subjects with fever, the cardinal symptom of SARS, and avian influenza. The accuracy of the infrared system can, however, be affected by human, environmental, and equipment variables. It is also limited by the fact that the thermal imager measures the skin temperature and not the core body temperature. As known, the body determines a temperature as its so\u2010called \u201Cset point\u201D at any one time during the body temperature regulation. Fever happens if the hypothalamus detects pyrogens and then raises the set point. The time course of a typical fever can be divided into three stages. When the fever initiates, the body attempts to raise its temperature but vasoconstriction occurs to prevent heat loss through the skin. With this reason, some individuals at this stage of fever (at the rising slope and immediately after fever begins or falling slope after the fever breaks) will not be detected by the scanner if it is not designed to detect subject at the plateau of the fever (with her/his high core temperature) in particular. This paper aims to study the effectiveness of infrared systems for its application in mass blind screening to detect subjects with elevated body temperature. For this application, it is critical for thermal imagers to be able to identify febrile from normal subjects accurately. Minimizing the number of false positive and false negative cases, improves the efficiency of the screening stations. False negative results should be avoided at all costs, as letting a SARS infected person through the screening process may result in potentially catastrophic results. Various statistical methods such as linear regression, Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis, and neural networks based classification were used to analyze the temperature data collected from various sites on the face on both the frontal and side profiles. Two important conclusions were drawn from the analysis: the best region on the face to obtain temperature readings and the optimal preset threshold temperature for the thermal imager. To conclude, the current research application will remain an interest and useful for reference by both local and overseas manufacturers of thermal scanners, users, and various government and private establishments. As elevation of body temperature is a common presenting symptom for many illnesses including infectious diseases, thermal imagers are useful tools for mass screening of body temperature not only for SARS but also during other public health crisis where widespread transmission of infection is a concern.","publish_time":"2004-12-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ng, Eddie Y.\u2010K.","journal":"Med Phys","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9514fcd21aa88fe81e585b2fd6cf86d414e34f06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168465.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168465/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2MDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["skin temperature","core body temperature","mass screening of body temperature","temperature readings","temperature patterns","temperature data","elevated body temperature","elevation of body temperature","body temperature regulation","high core temperature","stage of fever","typical fever","fever initiates","fever breaks","thermal imagers","optimal preset threshold temperature","spread of SARS","body attempts","screening process","screening stations","mass blind screening of potential SARS infected persons","cardinal symptom of SARS","use of infrared thermal imaging cameras","Infrared thermography","False negative results","overseas manufacturers of thermal scanners","various government","various sites","false negative cases","normal subjects","effectiveness of infrared systems","face","set point","Various statistical methods","number of false positive","current research application","useful tools","Characteristics analysis","infectious diseases","important role","important conclusions","time course","rising slope","catastrophic results","IR cameras","common presenting symptom","linear regression","users","illnesses","Receiver","accurate means","widespread transmission of infection","public health crisis","digital image","efficiency","neural networks","reference","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","vasoconstriction","classification","pyrogens","private establishments","heat loss","best region","avian influenza","detection of inflammation","nerve dysfunctions","human","equipment variables","concern","individuals","costs","reason","frontal","coronavirus","accuracy","plateau","hypothalamus","profiles","paper","stages"],"language":"en"},

Depending on the species, parasites can disrupt intestinal bacterial microbiota affecting essential vitamin biosynthesis. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 37 asymptomatic children from a previous cross-sectional Argentinian study. A multi-parallel real-time quantitative PCR was implemented for Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura, Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia duodenalis. In addition, whole-genome sequencing analysis was conducted for bacterial microbiota on all samples and analyzed using Livermore Metagenomic Analysis Toolkit and DIAMOND software. Separate analyses were carried out for uninfected, Giardia-only, Giardia \u002B helminth co-infections, and helminth-only groups. RESULTS: For Giardia-only infected children compared to uninfected children, DNA sequencing data showed a decrease in microbiota biodiversity that correlated with increasing Giardia burden and was statistically significant using Shannon\u02BCs alpha diversity (Giardia-only \u003E 1 fg/\u00B5l 2.346; non-infected group 3.253, P = 0.0317). An increase in diversity was observed for helminth-only infections with a decrease in diversity for Giardia \u002B helminth co-infections (P = 0.00178). In Giardia-only infections, microbiome taxonomy changed from Firmicutes towards increasing proportions of Prevotella, with the degree of change related to the intensity of infection compared to uninfected (P = 0.0317). The abundance of Prevotella bacteria was decreased in the helminths-only group but increased for Giardia \u002B helminth co-infections (P = 0.0262). Metagenomic analysis determined cobalamin synthesis was decreased in the Giardia \u003E 1 fg/\u00B5l group compared to both the Giardia \u003C 1 fg/\u00B5l and the uninfected group (P = 0.0369). Giardia \u002B helminth group also had a decrease in cobalamin CbiM genes from helminth-only infections (P = 0.000754).

The aim of the present study was to document the incidence and clinical features of NP in patients with community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on CAP patients who had been admitted to a tertiary referral centre and who had available enhanced CT scan images. Patients were allocated into NP and non\u2010NP groups, and they were compared with respect to various clinical variables. RESULTS: Of the 830 patients included in the present study, necrotizing change was observed in 103 patients (12%). Patients with NP experienced more symptoms of pneumonia, had higher blood levels of inflammatory markers and more often required pleural drainage compared to patients with non\u2010NP. Although the use of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor infusion, 30\u2010day mortality, in\u2010hospital mortality and clinical deterioration did not differ between the NP and non\u2010NP groups, the median length of hospital stay (LOS) was significantly longer in the NP group. Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards model showed that necrotizing change independently predicted LOS in patients with CAP.

Data regarding health care worker (HCW) perceptions and problems encountered with the use of the PAPRs were lacking. Methodology: A questionnaire\u2010based survey was conducted of HCWs who had used the PAPR in clinical practice during the SARS outbreak, when use of the PAPR was mandatory and widespread. Evaluations of the question of whether HCWs were receptive to the use of the PAPR and their perceptions of common problems that were encountered were made. Perceptions of comfort, ease of use, visual, hearing, breathing and speech impairment, perceived protection against SARS and usage preferences were recorded. Results: Only a minority of respondents found the PAPR uncomfortable, despite some interference with communication. Despite its much higher cost, the majority (84%) preferred to use the PAPR rather than the N\u201095 respirator when treating suspected SARS patients. However, opinions were equally divided regarding its use when treating patients with pulmonary tuberculosis; with 51% being in favour. Conclusions: With the advent of highly contagious diseases that pose a major occupational hazard to HCWs, the use of the PAPR has become more acceptable in clinical practice.","publish_time":"2005-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"KHOO, Kay\u2010Leong; LENG, Poh\u2010Hock; IBRAHIM, Irwani Bte; LIM, TK","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e302c632f8d595d2a1b00754d328d38588be67cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169158.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169158/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PAPR","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ease of use","PAPR uncomfortable","HCWs","SARS outbreak","suspected SARS patients","Perceptions of comfort","perceptions of common problems","clinical practice","setting of pulmonary tuberculosis","advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome","perceived protection","speech impairment","health care worker","major occupational hazard","hearing","contagious diseases","Data","based survey","usage preferences","minority of respondents","powered air","Methodology","questionnaire","interference","higher cost","majority","communication","Results","Objectives","Evaluations","Conclusions","PAPRs","opinions","favour"],"language":"en"},

Published data on sequelae of SARS are limited. Clinical follow\u2010up of patients who recovered from SARS has demonstrated radiological, functional and psychological abnormalities of varying degrees. In the early rehabilitation phase, many complained of limitations in physical function from general weakness and/or shortness of breath. In a small series of subjects who underwent CT scan of the chest, over half showed some patchy changes consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. Lung function testing at 6\u20138 weeks after hospital discharge showed mild or moderate restrictive pattern consistent with muscle weakness in 6\u201320% of subjects. Mild decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity was detected in a minority of subjects. Preliminary evidence suggests that these lung function abnormalities will improve over time. Psychobehavioural problems of anxiety and/or depression were not uncommon in the early recovery phase, and improved over time in the majority of patients. Avascular necrosis of the hip has been reported as another complication. The long\u2010term sequelae of SARS are still largely unknown.

The 3D morphology and unique optical property of the ZnO nanorods boost the detection limit of the H5N2 AIV to as low as 3.6 \u00D7 10(3) EID(50) mL(\u22121) (EID(50): 50% embryo infectious dose), which is \u224822 times more sensitive than conventional enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay.

There are four serotypes which cause respiratory illnesses in children and adults. HPIVs bind and replicate in the ciliated epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract and the extent of the infection correlates with the location involved. Seasonal HPIV epidemics result in a significant burden of disease in children and account for 40% of pediatric hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRTIs) and 75% of croup cases. Parainfluenza viruses are associated with a wide spectrum of illnesses which include otitis media, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, croup, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia. Uncommon respiratory manifestations include apnea, bradycardia, parotitis, and respiratory distress syndrome and rarely disseminated infection. Immunity resulting from disease in childhood is incomplete and reinfection with HPIV accounts for 15% of respiratory illnesses in adults. Severe disease and fatal pneumonia may occur in elderly and immunocompromised adults. HPIV pneumonia in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is associated with 50% acute mortality and 75% mortality at 6 months. Though sensitive molecular diagnostics are available to rapidly diagnose HPIV infection, effective antiviral therapies are not available. Currently, treatment for HPIV infection is supportive with the exception of croup where the use of corticosteroids has been found to be beneficial. Several novel drugs including DAS181 appear promising in efforts to treat severe disease in immunocompromised patients, and vaccines to decrease the burden of disease in young children are in development.","publish_time":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Branche, Angela R.; Falsey, Ann R.","journal":"Semin Respir Crit Care Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97309ae72b08e072b58de042f1a0dd7f724279ee.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7171724.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171724/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs3ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HPIV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory illnesses","HPIV infection","HPIV pneumonia","lower respiratory tract illnesses","Severe disease","HPIV accounts","significant burden of disease","Uncommon respiratory manifestations","respiratory distress syndrome","infection correlates","immunocompromised adults","Seasonal HPIV epidemics","wide spectrum of illnesses","exception of croup","fatal pneumonia","young children","Human parainfluenza viruses","croup cases","HPIVs","enveloped RNA viruses","immunocompromised patients","acute mortality","bradycardia","recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant","parotitis","otitis media","pharyngitis","efforts","pediatric hospitalizations","conjunctivitis","apnea","childhood","reinfection","effective antiviral therapies","extent","vaccines","LRTIs","ciliated epithelial cells","DAS181","HSCT","Paramyoviridaie family","tracheobronchitis","novel drugs","sensitive molecular diagnostics","use of corticosteroids","development","treatment","serotypes","location","Immunity","months"],"language":"en"},

Much attention has been paid to the species diversity of copepods worldwide, but the phylogeography and genetic diversity of copepods in Nigeria is unexplored. RESULTS: Using a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I marker, we preformed phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses for Cyclopidae copepods in Southeast Nigeria. A high species diversity of Cyclopidae in Nigeria: 5 species of Tropocyclops, 5 species of Mesocyclops and 2 species of Thermocyclops from Cyclopidae were identified in 15 populations. Moreover, we detected 18 unique haplotypes, which fell into two distinct clades. Pairwise genetic distances (uncorrected p-distances) among the species of Cyclopidae ranged from 0.05 to 0.257. Several species co-existed in the same lake, and some haplotypes were shared among different geographic populations, suggesting a dispersal of Cyclopidae in our sampling region. Finally, we found that the population genetic diversity for each species of Cyclopidae was low in Nigeria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings explored the species diversity and distribution of copepods within the family Cyclopidae for 15 Nigerian freshwater ecosystems: a high species diversity of Cyclopidae copepods was detected over a small geographic sampling range.

In order to overcome this continuous barrage of microorganisms, there is a complex array of defense mechanisms present in the upper and lower respiratory tract capable of eradicating these organisms.

Nested PCR using a conserved sense primer and either a GAV- or YHV-specific antisense primer to a divergent sequence differentially amplified a 277 bp region of the primary PCR amplicon. Multiplexing the YHV antisense primer with a GAV antisense primer to another divergent sequence allowed the viruses to be distinguished in a single nested PCR. Nested PCR enhanced detection sensitivity between 100- and 1000-fold and GAV or YHV RNA was detectable in \u223C10 fg lymphoid organ total RNA. The multiplex RT-nested PCR was also able to co-detect GAV and YHV RNA mixed over a wide range of concentrations to simulate potential dual-infection states. The robustness of the test was examined using RNA samples from Penaeus monodon prawns infected either chronically or acutely with GAV or YHV and collected at different locations in Eastern Australia and Thailand between 1994 and 1998. GAV- (406 bp) or YHV-specific (277 bp) amplicons were differentially generated in all cases, including five YHV RNA samples in which no primary RT-PCR amplicon was detected.

Because of their segmented genome, influenza viruses provide a suitable system to prove this concept. The studies employing virus mutants and reassortants have indicated that the pathogenicity depends on the functional integrity of each gene and on a gene constellation optimal for the infection of a given host. As a consequence, virtually every gene product of influenza virus has been reported to contribute to pathogenicity, but evidence is steadily growing that a key role has to be assigned to hemagglutinin. As the initiator of infection, hemagglutinin has a double function: (1) promotion of adsorption of the virus to the cell surface, and (2) penetration of the viral genome through a fusion process among viral and cellular membranes. Adsorption is based on the binding to neuraminic acid-containing receptors, and different virus strains display a distinct preference for specific oligosaccharides. Fusion capacity depends on proteolytic cleavage by host proteases, and variations in amino acid sequence at the cleavage site determine whether hemagglutinin is activated in a given cell. Differences in cleavability and presumably also in receptor specificity are important determinants for host tropism, spread of infection, and pathogenicity. The concept that proteolytic activation is a determinant for pathogenicity was originally derived from studies on avian influenza viruses, but there is now evidence that it may also be relevant for the disease in humans because bacterial proteases have been found to promote the development of influenza pneumonia in mammals.","publish_time":"2008-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Klenk, Hans-Dieter; Rott, Rudolf","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173235/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenicity","gene product of influenza virus","virus mutants","hemagglutinin","host proteases","given host","different virus strains","avian influenza viruses","proteolytic cleavage","host tropism","viral genome","initiator of infection","studies","development of influenza pneumonia","accepted concept","given cell","evidence","gene constellation optimal","cleavage site","fusion process","neuraminic acid","Fusion capacity","proteolytic activation","bacterial proteases","segmented genome","promotion of adsorption","cell surface","amino acid sequence","distinct preference","receptors","variations","receptor specificity","important determinants","suitable system","disease","humans","binding","cellular membranes","double function","reassortants","specific oligosaccharides","cleavability","mammals","penetration","functional integrity","polygenic nature","key role","consequence","Differences"],"language":"en"},

A qualitative study based on the Straussian grounded theory approach was established. Semi-structured, face-to-face, individual interviews were conducted with 26 emergency nurses for data collection. Adapting protocol to the evolving context of practice was revealed as the core category. Four interplaying subcategories were identified: (1) Completing a comprehensive assessment, (2) continuing education for emerging infectious disease management, (3) incorporating guideline updates and (4) navigating new duties and competencies. The nurses demonstrated the prudence to orientate themselves to an ambiguous work situation and displayed the ability to adapt and embrace changes in their practice and duties.

The model is intended to understand spread of influence, or any other spreading process implying a threshold dynamics, in setups of interconnected networks with significant clustering. The contagion is assumed to be general enough to account for a content-dependent linear threshold model, where each link type has a different weight (for spreading influence) that may depend on the content (e.g., product, rumor, political view) that is being spread. Using the generating functions formalism, we determine the conditions, probability, and expected size of the emergent global cascades. This analysis provides a generalization of previous approaches and is especially useful in problems related to spreading and percolation. The results present nontrivial dependencies between the clustering coefficient of the networks and its average degree. In particular, several phase transitions are shown to occur depending on these descriptors. Generally speaking, our findings reveal that increasing clustering decreases the probability of having global cascades and their size, however, this tendency changes with the average degree. There exists a certain average degree from which on clustering favors the probability and size of the contagion. By comparing the dynamics of complex contagions over multiplex networks and their monoplex projections, we demonstrate that ignoring link types and aggregating network layers may lead to inaccurate conclusions about contagion dynamics, particularly when the correlation of degrees between layers is high.","publish_time":"2017-01-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhuang, Yong; Arenas, Alex; Ya\u011Fan, Osman","journal":"Phys Rev E","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/64ff39166d22c00425e34581fe3d7b50b9eb2053.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217513.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217513/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["contagion dynamics","probability","threshold dynamics","clustering coefficient","significant clustering","dynamics of complex contagions","certain average degree","setups of interconnected networks","class of clustered multiplex networks","expected size","spreading process","spread of influence","emergent global cascades","mathematical analysis of generalized complex contagions","content-dependent linear threshold model","link types","aggregating network layers","results present nontrivial dependencies","inaccurate conclusions","conditions","product","rumor","generalization of previous approaches","different weight","correlation of degrees","monoplex projections","tendency changes","problems","political view","generating functions formalism","phase transitions","percolation","findings","descriptors"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, a number of recent studies have started to go beyond the assumption of an absence of coupling between the spread of a disease and the structure of the contacts on which it unfolds. Models including awareness of the spread have been proposed, to mimic possible precautionary measures taken by individuals that decrease their risk of infection, but have mostly considered static networks. Here, we adapt such a framework to the more realistic case of temporal networks of interactions between individuals. We study the resulting model by analytical and numerical means on both simple models of temporal networks and empirical time-resolved contact data. Analytical results show that the epidemic threshold is not affected by the awareness but that the prevalence can be significantly decreased. Numerical studies on synthetic temporal networks highlight, however, the presence of very strong finite-size effects, resulting in a significant shift of the effective epidemic threshold in the presence of risk awareness. For empirical contact networks, the awareness mechanism leads as well to a shift in the effective threshold and to a strong reduction of the epidemic prevalence.","publish_time":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moinet, Antoine; Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo; Barrat, Alain","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b26e2f0c8d3e57e527e0e09a66b92ef057ca7778.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7217520.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217520/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs1MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["temporal interaction networks","synthetic temporal networks","simple models of temporal networks","static networks","empirical contact networks","numerical studies","effective epidemic threshold","epidemic prevalence","presence of risk awareness","realistic case of temporal networks of interactions","effective threshold","awareness mechanism","understanding of epidemic spreading models","numerical means","Analytical results","individuals","number of recent studies","empirical time","significant shift","strong reduction","contact data","risk of infection","resulting model","strong finite-size effects","thanks","properties","host populations","numerous modeling efforts","different structures","disease","absence of coupling","possible precautionary measures","progresses","assumption","contacts","framework"],"language":"en"},

The effect of obesity is unclear and has not been shown to independently increase the likelihood of PPCs in trauma patients undergoing trauma laparotomy. We hypothesized the likelihood of mortality and PPCs would increase as body mass index (BMI) increases in trauma patients undergoing trauma laparotomy. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010\u20132016) was queried to identify trauma patients \u2265 18-years-old undergoing trauma laparotomy within 6-h of presentation. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the likelihood of PPCs and mortality when stratified by BMI. RESULTS: From 8,330 patients, 2,810 (33.7%) were overweight (25\u201329.9 kg/m(2)), 1444 (17.3%) obese (30\u201334.9 kg/m(2)), 580 (7.0%) severely obese (35\u201339.9 kg/m(2)), and 401 (4.8%) morbidly obese (\u2265 40 kg/m(2)). After adjusting for covariates including age, injury severity score, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, and rib/lung injury, the likelihood of PPCs increased with increasing BMI: overweight (OR = 1.37, CI 1.07\u20131.74, p = 0.012), obese (OR = 1.44, CI 1.08\u20131.92, p = 0.014), severely obese (OR = 2.20, CI 1.55\u20133.14, p \u003C 0.001), morbidly obese (OR = 2.42, CI 1.67\u20133.51, p \u003C 0.001), compared to those with normal BMI. In addition, the adjusted likelihood of mortality increased for the morbidly obese (OR = 2.60, CI 1.78\u20133.80, p \u003C 0.001) compared to those with normal BMI. CONCLUSION: Obese trauma patients undergoing emergent trauma laparotomy have a high likelihood for both PPCs and mortality, with morbidly obese trauma patients having the highest likelihood for both. This suggests obesity should be accounted for in risk prediction models of trauma patients undergoing laparotomy.

We measured the time from admission to mobilization and other clinical characteristics for 190 heart failure patients (mean age, 80.7 years). The primary outcome was heart failure rehospitalization. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves were plotted and the hazard ratios for rehospitalization were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression models. During a median follow-up period of 750 days, 58 patients underwent rehospitalization. The time from admission to mobilization was significantly longer for these patients than for those who were not rehospitalized. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that the time from admission to mobilization was an independent predictor of rehospitalization, and receiver-operating characteristic analysis determined an optimal cutoff value of 3 days for differentiating the patients more likely to experience a subsequent cardiac event (sensitivity, 76%; specificity, 69%; area under the curve, 0.667). Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curve analysis showed a significantly lower event rate in the \u2264 3-day group (p = 0.001, log-rank test). In conclusion, the time from admission to mobilization may be one of the strongest predictors of rehospitalization in elderly heart failure patients.

METHODS: We used descriptive statistics to characterize infections within a retrospective cohort characterized previously. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess potential risk factors for infection and associations with key outcomes such as short-term mortality and length of stay. RESULTS: The study cohort of 1112 patients included 33% women with a mean age of 56 \u00B1 10 years. Infections were common (20%), with respiratory and urinary tract infections the most frequent. We did not observe a difference in the incidence of infection on admission based on patient demographic factors such as race/ethnicity or estimated household income. Infections on admission were associated with greater short-term mortality (12% vs 4% in-hospital and 14% vs 7% 30-day), longer length of stay (6 vs 3 days), intensive care unit admission (28% vs 18%), and acute-on-chronic liver failure (10% vs 2%) (p \u003C 0.01 for all).

However, there has been a more limited evaluation of the impact of race on immediate perioperative outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare 30-day postoperative outcomes among different races. STUDY DESIGN: The 2016 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) database was queried to identify patients aged \u2265 18 and body mass index \u2265 35 who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) with known information on race. We then evaluated the effect of five different races on four different 30-day outcomes. RESULTS: Of the total 106,932 patients (79.5% White, 19.3% African American (AA), 0.5% Asian, 0.4% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.3% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander), 30-day rates of postoperative complication, readmission, re-intervention, and reoperation were 6, 3.8, 1.3, and 1.2%, respectively. After controlling for other covariates in multivariate logistic regression and selecting White as reference, AA was the only race associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.13; confidence interval [CI] 1.06\u20131.2) and readmissions (OR 1.47; CI 1.3\u20131.6).

We have developed an algorithm that searches entire genomic or mRNA sequences for frameshifting sites, and implements the algorithm as a web-based program called FSFinder (Frameshift Signal Finder). The current version of FSFinder is capable of finding \u22121 frameshift sites on heptamer sequences X XXY YYZ, and \u002B1 frameshift sites for two genes: protein chain release factor B (prfB) and ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (oaz). We tested FSFinder on \u223C190 genomic and partial DNA sequences from a number of organisms and found that it predicted frameshift sites efficiently and with greater sensitivity and specificity than existing approaches. It has improved sensitivity because it considers many known components of a frameshifting cassette and searches these components on both \u002B and \u2212 strands, and its specificity is increased because it focuses on overlapping regions of open reading frames and prioritizes candidate frameshift sites. FSFinder is useful for discovering unknown genes that utilize alternative decoding, as well as for analyzing frameshift sites.

Although several models have been proposed concerning the mechanism by which the 5-substituents regulate codon-reading properties of the tRNAs, none could explain recent results of the experiments utilizing well-characterized modification-deficient strains of Escherichia coli. Here, we first summarize previous studies on the codon-reading properties of tRNA molecules with a U derivative at the wobble position. Then, we propose a hypothetical mechanism of the reading of the G-ending codons by such tRNA molecules that could explain the experimental results. The hypothesis supposes unconventional base pairs between a protonated form of the modified uridines and the G at the third position of the codon stabilized by two direct hydrogen bonds between the bases. The hypothesis also addresses differences between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic decoding systems.","publish_time":"2003-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Takai, Kazuyuki; Yokoyama, Shigeyuki","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-pdf/31/22/6383/7038895/gkg839.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs2MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["codons","wobble position","reading","properties of tRNA molecules","hypothesis","modified uridines","recent results","experimental results","hypothetical mechanism","well-characterized modification-deficient strains of Escherichia coli","protonated form","experiments","U derivative","unconventional base pairs","differences","direct hydrogen bonds","tRNAs","eukaryotic decoding systems","bases","substituents","pyrimidine","purine","previous studies","methylene carbon","uracil ring","models"],"language":"en"},

The impact of pathogens on exacerbation severity and treatment response remains unclear. Our aim was to describe the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in children presenting to the emergency department (ED) and investigate the association between pathogens and (i) exacerbation severity on presentation and (ii) ED treatment failure. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of the DOORWAY study, a prospective multi-center cohort of children (1\u201317 years) presenting to the ED with moderate or severe asthma exacerbation. All received per protocol oral corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Nasopharyngeal (NPA) secretions were analyzed by RT-PCR for 30 different pathogens. Linear and logistic multivariate regression models were used to estimate absolute risks and risk differences (RD) with their 95% CI representing average marginal effects. RESULTS: Of 958 patients with NPA specimens, 591 (61.7%) were positive for \u2265 1 pathogens; human rhinovirus (HRV) was the most prevalent (29.4%). Non-HRV infection (RD -12.9%; 95% CI -19.5; -6.3), human metapneumovirus (RD -13.6%; 95% CI -23.0%; -4.3%) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) (RD -31.7%; 95% CI -44.5%; -18.9%) were negatively associated with severity; no association was found between severity and the presence of any pathogen, co-infection, or the specific viruses HRV-A, HRV-B, HRV-C, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza (INF), enterovirus serotype D68, adenovirus or coronavirus. The risk of treatment failure in the absence of a pathogen was 12.5% (95% CI 9.0%; 16.0%). The presence of any pathogen (RD 8.2%; 95% CI 3.3%; 13.1%) and non-HRV infection as a group (RD 13.1%; 95% CI 6.4%; 19.8%), and of INF and PIV specifically (RD 24.9%; 95% CI 4.7%; 45.1% and RD 34.1%; 95% CI 7.5%; 60.7%) were positively associated with treatment failure. CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of children with moderate or severe exacerbation, no single respiratory pathogen was associated with higher severity on presentation. However, in addition to any pathogen and non-HVR infection, INF and PIV were specifically associated with higher treatment failure in the ED, supporting the need for influenza prevention, pathogen identification at presentation and exploration of pathogen-therapy interaction.

Nevertheless, the precise microbial etiology is not identified in many cases. METHODS: Prospectively collected 63 respiratory specimens (sputum or throat swab) from patients presented with respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, or abnormal findings of chest auscultation) after travel were tested using multiplex real-time PCR. The FTD Respiratory pathogens 33 (Fast-track diagnostics, Ltd.) can simultaneously detect 33 different respiratory pathogens directly from respiratory specimens. This test ran in the PCR-Only mode on BD MAX\u2122 (Nippon Becton Dickinson Company, Ltd.) and LightCycler480 System (Roche). RESULTS: Fifty-nine consecutive cases were included in the study. Thirty-nine cases were diagnosed as non-specific upper respiratory tract infections, five cases were influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, threecases was acute sinusitis, and one case was acute pharyngitis, dengue fever. Twenty-four cases had returned from travel in Southeast Asia, nine from Africa, and 8 from Latin America, seven from South Asia, six from middle east, threefrom North America, threefrom East Asia, 2 from Oceania, and one from Europe. Of the 59 specimens analyzed, 48 (81.4%) tested positive for pathogens whereas 11 tested negative. Commonly detected pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (14 cases; 23.7%), influenza A (10 cases; 17.0%), rhinovirus (9 cases; 15.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (8 cases; 13.6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (8 cases; 13.6%), Streptococcus pneumonia, coronaviruses OC43, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (4 cases; 6.8%, respectively). Multiple pathogens were detected in 30.5% of the specimens. In 14 cases (23.7%), both virus and bacteria were detected from one specimen. CONCLUSION: Not only viruses, bacterial pathogens were detected frequently than expected in the patients of RTI. Comprehensive molecular testing such as multiplex real-time PCR would change our understandings of epidemiology of RTI among travelers.

Furthermore, there is limited information of MERS-CoV in East Africa. In this study, MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from Ethiopia was detected using RT-qPCR. Next-generation sequencing was used to obtain the full genome of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV antibodies were also detected through MERS-spike pseudoparticle neutralization assay. Phylogenetic analysis of full-genome sequences and spike-genome antibodies indicates that MERS-CoV in East Africa is genetically distinct from those in the Arabian Peninsula. The results from this study show that MERS-CoV circulating in dromedary camels in East Africa are genetically distinct from those in the Arabian Peninsula.

Multiple studies have suggested that adults with influenza who are underweight, overweight, or obese have increased risk of hospitalization compared with those of normal weight. We sought to determine whether risk of hospitalization among patients infected with influenza or other respiratory viruses differs by BMI among patients in Puerto Rico. METHODS: We analyzed data from patients enrolled in the Sentinel Enhanced Dengue Surveillance System (SEDSS), a prospective study of patients with acute febrile illness (AFI), from May 2012 to September 2018. We evaluated those older than 24 months, who had height, weight, and clinical disposition recorded, and tested positive by RT\u2013PCR for infection with influenza A (n = 1253), influenza B (n = 844), adenovirus (n = 435), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 289), parainfluenza virus (n = 361), metapneumovirus (n = 247), or coronavirus (n = 15). BMI categories were determined using standard cutoffs in adults and BMI-for-age percentiles for children and adolescents. Risk of hospitalization by BMI category was calculated using multivariate Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among the 3,388 patients included, 675 (20%) were overweight, 926 (27%) were obese, 405 (12%) were underweight, and 1382 (41%) were normal weight. Median age was 13.4 (range: 2\u2013100 years), and 50% were male. Risk of hospitalization was not significantly different in children and adult patients infected with a respiratory virus who were overweight relative to those that had normal BMI; however, once hospitalized, obese individuals of any age had a mean length of hospital stay 1.7 days longer than normal weight persons (95% CI: 0.27\u20133.17 days). Among adult patients, underweight patients were nearly 3 times more likely to be hospitalized compared with normal weight patients (relative risk 2.8, 95% CI: 1.4\u20135.9). Underweight children were not at increased risk of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Among patients infected with a respiratory virus, risk of hospitalization was higher among underweight adult patients, and obese patients had a longer mean length of stay once hospitalized. Body mass index should be considered when evaluating risk and managing these patients.

Little is known, however, about differences in frequencies of viral infection between CC children and those cared for exclusively at home. METHODS: Using surveillance data from the HIVE household cohort in southeast Michigan from 2014\u20132018 (4 seasons), we analyzed 1022 illness cases from 354 children aged 0\u20136 years. Age groups were dichotomized as infants (aged \u003C2 years) and toddlers/preschoolers (aged 2\u20136 years). Households were prospectively enrolled and nasal respiratory swabs were collected from children upon report of acute illness symptoms. We used real-time RT\u2013PCR to test for 18 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: We detected at least one virus in 855 illness cases (83% of all illnesses reported). Age at first illness onset in all four seasons was significantly younger among CC children than homecare children (P \u003C 0.001) across all 4 years (average difference = 1.25 years). CC children \u003C2 years had slightly lower odds of viral detection during illness (OR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.49, 1.61]) but higher odds at ages 2\u20136y (1.07 [0.65, 1.76]); neither was statistically significant. Neither CC nor homecare children were significantly more or less at risk for any particular pathogen\u2014expect for rhinovirus in the \u003C2-year group, where odds of rhinovirus infection were 58% lower (OR = 0.42) in CC children compared with homecare counterparts (95% CI, 0.21\u20130.83). Conversely, CC attendees under 3 more frequently had influenza, RSV, hMPV, parainfluenza, and coronavirus; however, none of these associations were significant. Odds of coinfection (\u003E 1 virus detected) were higher among CC children, but not significant (OR = 1.4 [0.63, 2.96] and 1.2 [0.77, 1.88] in \u003C2 year and 2\u20136 year age groups, respectively). Among all children \u003C7 year, the mean number of pathogens detected was not different between CC and homecare individuals (1.20 vs. 1.23, P = 0.16). CONCLUSION: As expected, results indicated that CC attendees aged 0\u20136y experienced illness episodes earlier in life compared with homecare children. Our analysis also indicated that, compared with children cared for at home, CC children were less at risk for rhinovirus infection when young but could potentially be at higher risk for viruses of greater clinical concern.

The amplified PCR products of TGEV HB06 were cloned, sequenced, and compared with other TGEV strains genes selected from the GenBank. Then, the recombinant fragment in pMD18-T was subcloned into corresponding sites of prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6P-1 after digestion with EcoRI and XhoI to construct a recombinant fusion expression vector pGEX-6P-M. Then, the verified recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli Rossetta (DE3), and the expression of M fusion protein was induced by using isopropylthio-beta-D-galactoside (IPTG) as inducer. The results showed that the gene fragment of M at a length of 789 bp was amplified and cloned into the vector pMD18-T successfully, and sequence comparison with that reported in GenBank revealed that the M gene complete sequence shares more than 94% homology in nucleotide. The result of SDS-PAGE showed that the recombinant membrane protein had a molecular mass of approximately 56 kDa, which was the same as the expected results. It was proven by Western blotting that the recombinant membrane protein had strong positive reactions with TGEV-specific antibody. Therefore, the expressed fusion protein has a good antigenicity.

METHOD: After the mice had been immunized intramuscularly and/or intraperitoneally with pcDNA3.1-N and rAd-N in prime-triple boost immunization, humoral and cellular immune responses were detected. RESULTS: After detection, different levels of anti-N humoral and cellular responses are shown compared to controls. The humoral immune response was induced more effectively by the DNA priming and recombinant adenovirus boosting regimen and the reverse sequence of heterogeneous combinations. There is a significant difference between heterogeneous and homologous vaccinations. However, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response was not significantly altered by the different prime-boost immunizations or the recombinant adenovirus of pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boost regimen alone, but lymphoproliferation and interferon-\u03B3 (IFN-\u03B3) secretion were all enhanced by heterologous combination immunizations compared to homologous combinations. For the reverse sequence immunization regimen, lymphoproliferation, IFN-\u03B3 and CTL responses were all significantly weaker compared with pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boost regimen. CONCLUSION: Taken together, of all the combinations, the prime-triple boost immunization of pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N can effectively induce SARS-CoV-N-specific and strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. The present results suggest that DNA immunization followed by recombinant adenovirus boosting could be used as a potential SARS-CoV vaccine in the induction of an enhanced humoral and cellular immune response.","publish_time":"2006-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chunling, Ma; Kun, Yao; Jian, Xu; Jian, Qin; Hua, Sun; Minsheng, Zhu","journal":"Intervirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92df84431c14b4d2e57d36ac437d52951b282156.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179534.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7179534/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsxMDAx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["N prime-rAd","N boost regimen","rAd-N prime-pcDNA3","N-specific","N gene","different levels of anti-N humoral","prime-triple boost immunization of pcDNA3","recombinant adenovirus of pcDNA3","cellular responses","cellular immune responses","humoral immune response","different prime-boost immunizations","induction of humoral","reverse sequence immunization regimen","CTL responses","DNA immunization","recombinant adenovirus boosting","reverse sequence of heterogeneous combinations","IFN-\u03B3","homologous combinations","lymphoproliferation","potential SARS-CoV vaccine","interferon-\u03B3","mice","homologous vaccinations","recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus","present results","heterologous combination immunizations","genetic vaccines","replication-defective adenoviral vector","secretion","detection","protein plasmid","significant difference","cytotoxic T lymphocyte","immunogenicity","controls","OBJECTIVE","METHOD","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Currently, there is no efficient treatment and prevention for this disease. We constructed recombinant adenoviral vectors that can express shRNAs, which inhibited the expression of SARS-CoV genes effectively in mammalian cells. METHODS: In this study, we designed several plasmids that express small hairpin RNA molecules (shRNA) specifically targeting to the genes encoding for the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein and envelope (E) protein, respectively. Effective shRNA molecules to the viral genes were screened and identified, and then constructed into adenovirus vectors. The effects of adenovirus-delivered small hairpin RNA on SARS-CoV gene expression were determined by RT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase activity assays. RESULTS: The levels of viral mRNAs and viral proteins of the targets were significantly decreased or completely inhibited in cell lines after being infected with the recombinant adenoviruses that expressed specific shRNA molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Since many cell types can be efficiently infected by adenovirus, recombinant adenoviruses could serve as an alternative powerful tool for shRNA delivery and for gene suppression, especially when the targeted cells are resistant to transfection by DNA or RNA. With availability of high titers of adenoviruses and uniform and rapid infection, this approach would have foreseeable wide applications both in experimental biology and molecular medicine.","publish_time":"2006-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Xue; Wu, Kailang; Yue, Xin; Zhu, Ying; Wu, Jianguo","journal":"Intervirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ccb32c4e7d73d0091afeafc7df3c9c6e1439be62.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7179548.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7179548/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs30","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of SARS","SARS-CoV nucleocapsid","SARS-CoV gene expression","CoV genes","SARS-associated coronavirus","viral genes","recombinant adenoviruses","specific shRNA molecules","Effective shRNA molecules","shRNA delivery","small hairpin RNA molecules","adenovirus vectors","viral proteins","recombinant adenoviral vectors","effects of adenovirus","levels of viral mRNAs","gene suppression","targeted cells","availability of high titers of adenoviruses","mammalian cells","lethal disease","cell types","cell lines","new type of coronavirus","experimental biology","Western blot","approach","uniform","foreseeable wide applications","RT-PCR","alternative powerful tool","rapid infection","envelope","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","transfection","plasmids","luciferase activity assays","OBJECTIVE","DNA","shRNAs","molecular medicine","efficient treatment","prevention","RESULTS","targets","study","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Noninvasive oxygenation strategies such as high-flow nasal cannula, standard oxygen therapy, and noninvasive ventilation (delivered by either face mask or helmet interface) are widely available interventions applied in these patients. It remains unclear which of these interventions are more effective in decreasing rates of invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. The primary objective of this network meta-analysis is to summarize the evidence and compare the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies on mortality and need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. METHODS: We will search key databases for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of noninvasive oxygenation strategies in adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We will exclude studies in which the primary focus is either acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality (longest available up to 90 days). The secondary outcomes will be receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (longest available up to 30 days). We will assess the risk of bias for each of the outcomes using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Bayesian network meta-analyses will be conducted to obtain pooled estimates of head-to-head comparisons. We will report pairwise and network meta-analysis treatment effect estimates as risk ratios and 95% credible intervals. Subgroup analyses will be conducted examining key populations including immunocompromised hosts. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted by excluding those studies with high risk of bias and different etiologies of acute respiratory failure. We will assess certainty in effect estimates using GRADE methodology. DISCUSSION: This study will help to guide clinical decision-making when caring for adult patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and improve our understanding of the limitations of the available literature assessing noninvasive oxygenation strategies in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Up to now there is no agreement on the upper limit age of bronchiolitis. Our aim was to identify if there are clinical differences in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis between 0\u20136 months and 6\u201312 months of age. A secondary aim was to establish whether there was differences in terms of recurrent wheezing at 12, 24, and 36 months of follow-up. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and virological records of 824 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis during 11 consecutive epidemic seasons. From each infant at admission to the hospital nasopharyngeal washing was collected, clinical severity was assessed and clinical data were extracted from a structured questionnaire. At 12\u201324\u201336 months after discharge, parents were interviewed seeking information on recurrent wheezing. Results: A total of 773 infants (Group1) were \u22646 months of age, while 51 were \u003E6 months (Group 2).

We explored the effect of maternal influenza-like illness (ILI) in pregnancy on the risk of fetal death, distinguishing between diagnoses during regular influenza seasons and the 2009/2010 pandemic and between trimesters of ILI. We used birth records from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to identify fetal deaths after the first trimester in singleton pregnancies (2006\u20132013). The Norwegian Directorate of Health provided dates of clinical influenza diagnoses by primary-health-care providers, whereas dates of laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H1N1) diagnoses were provided by the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases. We obtained dates and types of influenza vaccinations from the Norwegian Immunisation Registry. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of fetal death, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing women with and without an ILI diagnosis in pregnancy. There were 2510 fetal deaths among 417,406 eligible pregnancies. ILI during regular seasons was not associated with increased risk of fetal death: adjusted HR = 0.90 (95% CI 0.64\u20131.27). In contrast, ILI during the pandemic was associated with substantially increased risk of fetal death, with an adjusted HR of 1.75 (95% CI 1.21\u20132.54). The risk was highest following first-trimester ILI (adjusted HR = 2.28 [95% CI 1.45\u20133.59]). ILI during the pandemic\u2014but not during regular seasons\u2014was associated with increased risk of fetal death in the second and third trimester. The estimated effect was strongest with ILI in first trimester.

We previously analyzed Rns sequences from 18 isolates from morphological groups 2 and 3 and found that they fell into four distinct evolutionary lineages we called sequence types T1\u2010T4. Here, we analyzed sequences from 53 isolates representing 16 species and including 35 new strains. Eight additional lineages (sequence types T5\u2010T12) were identified. Four of the 12 sequence types included strains from more than one nominal species. Thus, sequence types could be equated with species in some cases or with complexes of closely related species in others. The largest complex, sequence type T4, which contained six closely related nominal species, included 24 of 25 keratitis isolates. Rns sequence variation was insufficient for full phylogenetic resolution of branching orders within this complex, but the mixing of species observed at terminal nodes confirmed that traditional classification of isolates has been inconsistent. One solution to this problem would be to equate sequence types and single species. Alternatively, additional molecular information will be required to reliably differentiate species within the complexes. Three sequence types of morphological group 1 species represented the earliest divergence in the history of the genus and, based on their genetic distinctiveness, are candidates for reclassification as one or more novel genera.","publish_time":"2007-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stothard, Diane R.; Schroeder\u2010Diedrich, Jill M.; Awwad, Mohammad H.; Gast, Rebecca J.; Ledee, Dolena R.; Rodriguez\u2010Zaragoza, Salvador; Dean, Chantal L.; Fuerst, Paul A.; Byers, Thomas J.","journal":"J Eukaryot Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16f093d0757e3ddab14b0d1c011be67581c5ceb5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194170/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjsyMDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["related species","nominal species","sequence types T5","sequence types T1","mixing of species","single species","sequence types of morphological group","Rns sequence variation","sequence type T4","Rns sequences","keratitis isolates","additional lineages","traditional classification of isolates","genus","complexes","largest complex","morphological groups","new strains","distinct evolutionary lineages","additional molecular information","terminal nodes","phylogenetic resolution of branching orders","reclassification","earliest divergence","phylogeny of Acanthamoeba","S rRNA gene","nomenclature","T12","genetic distinctiveness","improvements","basis","candidates","taxonomy","history","cases","problem","novel genera"],"language":"en"},

The average total contact rate per hour was 15.7. The authors developed a relatively simple algebraic model for estimating the dose of pathogens transferred to target facial membranes during a defined exposure period. The model considers the rate of pathogen transfer to the hands via contact with contaminated environmental surfaces, and the rate of pathogen loss from the hands due to pathogen die-off and transfer from the hands to environmental surfaces and to target facial membranes during touching. The estimation of infection risk due to this dose also is discussed.

The developed world responds to new and re\u2010emerging diseases through the discovery of medications. Disease can be transmitted around the world in a day, but the development of medications does not occur at this rate. The world has one environment and the focus in health care must be on identifying factors in this environment that coalesce to produce disease. Aim. The aim of this paper is to introduce the integrative model of environmental health and explore its potential to illuminate the Toronto SARS experience. Discussion. SARS affected people on three continents in a matter of days. Response to this new disease varied from one area to another and was dependent upon the level of integration of health services and communication across services. The present focus of the health care system is on treating the results of disease rather than the causative factors. Reacting to a new disease had grave social and economic consequences. The time for a new global environmental approach to health is now. The Toronto SARS experience was examined using the integrative model of environmental health and the upstream perspective as exemplars to interrupt the traditional approach to disease. All health care providers share the responsibility to learn about and to understand how our environment creates disease.

The purpose of this report was to provide molecular evidence supporting E cams\u2010like infection in 3 cats that had clinical manifestations consistent with canine ehrlichiosis but lacked antibodies to E canis antigens. Serum from all 3 cats contained antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). The predominant disease manifestation was polyarthritis in 1 cat and bone marrow hypoplasia or dysplasia, accompanied by pancytopenia or anemia and thrombocytopenia, in 1 cat each. The alignment of E canis partial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA; 382 nucleotide positions), amplified from EDTA blood samples from each cat, was identical to each other and was identical to a canine isolate of E canis (GenBank accession number AF373613). In 1 cat, concurrent treatment with corticosteroids may have interfered with the therapeutic effectiveness of doxycycline for the elimination of E canis\u2010like infection. To further define the spectrum of ehrlichiosis in cats, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing may be necessary until serologic testing is thoroughly validated in experimentally or naturally infected cats. In addition, until E canis has been isolated from cats and several tissue culture isolates are available from disparate geographic regions for detailed comparative genetic study, the molecular evidence presented in this study supporting E canis\u2010like infection in cats must be interpreted with caution.","publish_time":"2008-06-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Breitschwerdt, Edward B.; Abrams\u2010Ogg, Anthony C.G.; Lappin, Michael R.; Bienzle, Dorothee; Hancock, Susan I.; Cowan, Sara M.; Clooten, Jennifer K.; Hegarty, Barbara C.; Hawkins, Eleanor C.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/852a443585ef328329e4a35830163d69613fce5b.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199470/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EDTA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elimination of E canis","E canis antigens","infected cats","canine isolate of E canis","E cams","alignment of E canis partial","molecular evidence","serologic evidence of natural infection","pathogenic role of Ehrlichia canis","canine ehrlichiosis","serologic testing","spectrum of ehrlichiosis","antinuclear antibodies","detailed comparative genetic study","disparate geographic regions","S ribosomal DNA","polymerase chain reaction","rDNA","polyarthritis","dysplasia","tissue culture isolates","PCR","GenBank accession number AF373613","clinical manifestations consistent","infrequent detection of morulae","structures","nucleotide positions","bone marrow hypoplasia","EDTA blood samples","pancytopenia","therapeutic effectiveness of doxycycline","corticosteroids","anemia","predominant disease manifestation","cytoplasm of leukocytes","concurrent treatment","thrombocytopenia","report","basis","ANAs","Serum","addition","purpose","caution"],"language":"en"},

Here, we describe a case-control study that included 569 patients with SARS and 1188 control subjects and used in vitro assays to investigate the role that MBL plays in SARS-CoV infection. The distribution of MBL gene polymorphisms was significantly different between patients with SARS and control subjects, with a higher frequency of haplotypes associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL in patients with SARS than in control subjects. Serum levels of MBL were also significantly lower in patients with SARS than in control subjects. There was, however, no association between MBL genotypes, which are associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL, and mortality related to SARS. MBL could bind SARS-CoV in a dose- and calcium-dependent and mannan-inhibitable fashion in vitro, suggesting that binding is through the carbohydrate recognition domains of MBL. Furthermore, deposition of complement C4 on SARS-CoV was enhanced by MBL. Inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV by MBL in fetal rhesus kidney cells (FRhK-4) was also observed.

Both approaches were evaluated using historical Danish records. 3. Four different macrophyte assemblages were identified for mid\u2010sized streams in the Central and Eastern Lowland ecoregions. Macrophyte assemblages could not be delineated using physical stream site characteristics; however a gradual change in assemblage composition was attributed to differences in alkalinity and human impact. 4. Assemblages of contemporary vegetation in Denmark were quite similar to those found in Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian streams (26\u201335%). However, more importantly, from species\u2010based predictions we noted higher similarity, particularly with Latvian and Lithuanian streams, before intensive land use commenced in Denmark (c. 1900). These results show that stream sites from these three countries can be considered in a Danish reference network. 5. Two of the four macrophyte assemblages comprised species such as Fontinalis antipyretica, Myriophyllum spicatum, Nuphar lutea, Potamogeton alpinus and P. perfoliatus that have a very scattered occurrence in the contemporary vegetation in Denmark. These groups were closely associated with the predictions from historic records, thereby lending support the conjecture that these assemblages could be part of the guiding image for the identification of potential reference sites within Denmark.","publish_time":"2008-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"BAATTRUP\u2010PEDERSEN, ANNETTE; SPRINGE, GUNTA; RIIS, TENNA; LARSEN, S\u00D8REN E.; SAND\u2010JENSEN, KAJ; KJELLERUP LARSEN, LARS M.","journal":"Freshw Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7af3b57109f0a727b860c2f83dbfbe0c3023acd2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201899.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201899/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Water Framework Directive"],"locations":["Poland","Latvia","Lithuania","Denmark"],"keyphrases":["Denmark","different macrophyte assemblages","Assemblages of contemporary vegetation","impacted stream sites","Danish reference network","identification of potential reference sites","Lithuanian streams","identification of possible references sites","guiding image","ecological quality of stream ecosystems","species","historical Danish records","physical stream site characteristics","mid\u2010sized streams","based predictions","historic records","measure of ecological status","European Water Framework Directive","Nuphar lutea","Myriophyllum spicatum","Fontinalis antipyretica","Poland","Potamogeton alpinus","gradual change","intensive land use","differences","perfoliatus","higher similarity","deviation","Latvia","assemblage composition","scattered occurrence","alkalinity","Eastern Lowland ecoregions","support","Polish","human impact","approaches","conjecture","possibility","countries","results","groups"],"language":"en"},

All except I. wasastjernae have a basic karyotype of 34 autosomes plus sex chromosomes which are X0 (\u2642), XX (\u2640), with the X chromosome among the largest in the nucleus. This karyotype appears to be the norm for Ilybius and supports the transfer of the species concerned from Agabus to Ilybius. I. wasastjernae has 36 autosomes and the X chromosome is the smallest in the nucleus and its karyotype is unlike any other known karyotype in either Ilybius or Agabus. In most of the species studied no intraspecific variation has been detected. Exceptions are I. chalconatus, where there is one inversion polymorphism in one of the autosomes, and I. montanus whose autosome number has been found to vary from 29 to 34. Such variation is highly unusual among Coleoptera. The variation results from fusion\u2010fission polymorphisms involving three different pairs of autosomes. In each case the fusions may be homozygous, heterozygous or absent. All populations investigated were polymorphic for some of the fusions, but only one (La Salceda, Spain) included individuals lacking all fusions. The frequencies of fused and unfused chromosomes were analysed in three English populations. In only one case was there a departure from the values expected from the Hardy\u2010Weinberg equilibrium, and this population also showed a significant difference from the other two. Meiosis in males heterozygous for fusions involves the production of trivalents in first division, but results in the production of abundant sperm, with no evidence of chromosomal abnormalities in second metaphase, or of degenerating cells as a result of failed meiosis. The three fusions sites are consistent in all the populations studied, and it is concluded that these fusions represent unique historical events rather than current chromosomal instability.","publish_time":"2004-05-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"ARADOTTIR, G.

Progressive respiratory failure developed leading to admission to the intensive care unit, intubation and prone positioning was necessary. To ensure adequate oxygenation and lung protective ventilation veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was established. Despite maximal therapy and adequate antiinfective therapy of all discovered pathogens the condition of the patient declined further and he deceased. Postmortem autopsy revealed Mucor and Aspergillus mycelium in multiple organs such as lung, heart and pancreas as the underlying cause of his deterioration and death. CONCLUSION: Routine screening re-evaluation of every infection is essential for adequate initiation and discontinuation of every antiinfective therapy.

The MSCs are present throughout the body and are thought to play a role in tissue regeneration and inflammation control. In the event of injury, the local MSCs traverse the shortest possible distance from the tissue or blood vessels to reach the affected site. But, there are few undifferentiated cells in the tissues. The exogenous MSCs are used to immunity modify or regenerative treatments in preclinical models of acute pulmonary diseases. Several studies have shown the positive effects of MSCs replacement in the acute lung disorders.

Our previous work demonstrated that resistance by primary SJL/J glial cultures may involve events subsequent to viral gene expression, possibly due to a defect in cell-to-cell spread of the infection. Since S, the virion\u0027s major spike glycoprotein, is known to facilitate the spread of infection due to its syncytiogenic properties, we decided to investigate the role of this viral structural protein in resistance by primary SJL/J glial cells. Variants possessing deletions within the S coding region were able to grow in SJL/J glial cells 10\u2013100 times easier and fuse five-times more efficiently than wt virus. Induction of neurologic disease in SJL/J mice following intracranial inoculation with either wt JHMV or the S deletion variant, AT11f cord, was age-dependent, occurring only in animals inoculated under 4 weeks of age. Resistance in older animals to wt and variant viruses could be abrogated by immunosuppression with cyclosporin A. However, both disease incidence and viral brain titers were higher in animals receiving the JHM variant AT11f cord virus, suggesting that SJL/J resistance to neurologic disease may manifest itself through interactions between inefficient cell-to-cell spread of the infection and protective aspects of the immune response.","publish_time":"2004-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pasick, John M.M.; Wilson, Greame A.R.; Morris, Vincent L.; Dales, Samuel","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135822/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsxMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SJL/J","JHM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["resistance of SJL","J resistance","primary SJL","J mice","J glial cells","J glial cultures","wt virus","spread of infection","inefficient cell","S deletion variant","JHM variant AT11f cord virus","variant viruses","older animals","disease incidence","wt JHMV","Induction of neurologic disease","viral brain titers","viral structural protein","viral gene expression","S coding region","times easier","age-dependent","weeks of age","various strains of mouse hepatitis virus","events subsequent","intracranial inoculation","MHV","protective aspects","virion\u0027s major spike glycoprotein","deletions","interactions","immune response","previous work","Variants","immunosuppression","cyclosporin","role","fuse","defect","syncytiogenic properties","number","nature","determinants","subject","basis","debate"],"language":"en"},

The two most notable infectious diseases in recent years are severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza. In this review, these two severe zoonotic viral infections transmitted by the respiratory route, with pandemic potential, are used as models to illustrate the role of Chinese wet-markets in their emergence, amplification and dissemination. RECENT FINDINGS: Two research groups independently discovered the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like viruses in horseshoe bats. An astonishing diversity of coronaviruses was also discovered in different species of bats. For the recent and still ongoing avian influenza H5N1 outbreak that originated in Southeast Asia, from 2003 to 21 April 2006, 204 humans have been infected, with 113 deaths. Most patients had recent direct contacts with poultry. SUMMARY: In Chinese wet-markets, unique epicenters for transmission of potential viral pathogens, new genes may be acquired or existing genes modified through various mechanisms such as genetic reassortment, recombination and mutation. The wet-markets, at closer proximity to humans, with high viral burden or strains of higher transmission efficiency, facilitate transmission of the viruses to humans.","publish_time":"2006-10-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Woo, Patrick CY; Lau, Susanna KP; Yuen, Kwok-yung","journal":"Curr Opin Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24ce6d3bfb40001beb0a46dbf56e777a2cd0223e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141584.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141584/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyNTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Southeast Asia"],"keyphrases":["humans","transmission of potential viral pathogens","recent years","RECENT FINDINGS","recent direct contacts","role of Chinese wet-markets","presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","severe zoonotic viral infections","respiratory route","strains of higher transmission efficiency","high viral burden","new genes","existing genes","pandemic potential","close contacts","food animals","horseshoe bats","ongoing avian influenza H5N1 outbreak","different species of bats","unique epicenters","various mechanisms","closer proximity","genetic reassortment","notable infectious diseases","emergence","research groups","recombination","models","patients","poultry","Southeast Asia","mutation","amplification","China","review","SUMMARY","microbes","astonishing diversity of coronaviruses","dissemination","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Indeed, heparanase displays a unique versatility in degrading heparan sulfate chains of several proteoglycans expressed in all mammalian cells. This endo-\u03B2-D-glucuronidase is overexpressed in cancer, inflammation, diabetes, atherosclerosis, nephropathies and other pathologies. Starting from known low- or non-anticoagulant heparins, the search for heparanase inhibitors evolved focusing on structure-activity relationship studies and taking advantage of new chemical-physical analytical methods which have allowed characterization and sequencing of polysaccharide chains. New methods to screen heparanase inhibitors and to evaluate their mechanism of action and in vivo activity in experimental models prompted their development. New non-anticoagulant heparin derivatives endowed with anti-heparanase activity are reported.

The outer surface of the ionophore-ion comples is composed largely of nonpolar hydrocarbon, which imparts a high solubility to the complexes in nonpolar solvents. In biological systems, these complexes are freely soluble in the lipid components of membranes and, presumably, diffuse or shuttle through the membranes from one aqueous membrane interface to the other. The net effect for monensin is a trans-membrane exchange of sodium ions for protons. However, the interaction of an ionophore with biological membranes, and its ionophoric expression, is highly dependent on the biochemical configuration of the membrane itself. One apparent consequence of this exchange is the neutralization of acidic intracellular compartments such as the trans Golgi apparatus cisternae and associated elements, lysosomes, and certain endosomes. This is accompanied by a disruption of trans Golgi apparatus cisternae and of lysosome and acidic endosome function. At the same time, Golgi apparatus cisternae appear to swell, presumably due to osmotic uptake of water resulting from the inward movement of ions. Monensin effects on Golgi apparatus are observed in cells from a wide range of plant and animal species. The action of monensin is most often exerted on the trans half of the stacked cisternae, often near the point of exit of secretory vesicles at the trans face of the stacked cisternae, or, especially at low monensin concentrations or short exposure times, near the middle of the stacked cisternae. The effects of monensin are quite rapid in both animal and plant cells; i.e., changes in Golgi apparatus may be observed after only 2\u20135 min of exposure. It is implicit in these observations that the uptake of osmotically active cations is accompanied by a concomitant efflux of H(\u002B) and that a net influx of protons would be required to sustain the ionic exchange long enough to account for the swelling of cisternae observed in electron micrographs. In the Golgi apparatus, late processing events such as terminal glycosylation and proteolytic cleavages are most susceptible to inhibition by monensin. Yet, many incompletely processed molecules may still be secreted via yet poorly understood mechanisms that appear to bypass the Golgi apparatus. In endocytosis, monensin does not prevent internalization. However, intracellular degradation of internalized ligands may be prevented. It is becoming clear that endocytosis involves both acidic and non-acidic compartments and that monensin inhibits those processes that normally occur in acidic compartments. Thus, monensin, which is capable of collapsing Na(\u002B) and H(\u002B) gradients, has gained wide-spread acceptance as a tool for studying Golgi apparatus function and for localizing and identifying the molecular pathways of subcellular vesicular traffic involving acid compartments. Among its advantages are the low concentrations at which inhibitions are produced (0.01\u20131.0 \u03BCM), a minimum of troublesome side effects (e.g., little or no change of protein synthesis or ATP levels) and a reversible action. Because the affinity of monensin for Na(\u002B) is ten times that for K(\u002B), its nearest competitor, monensin mediates primarily a Na(\u002B)-H(\u002B) exchange. Monensin has little tendency to bind calcium. Not only is monensin of importance as an experimental tool, it is of great commercial value as a coccidiostat for poultry and to promote more efficient utilization of feed in cattle. The mechanisms by which monensin interact with coccidia and rumen microflora to achieved these benefits are reasonably well documented. However, the interactions between monensin and the tissues of the host animal are not well understood although the severe toxicological manifestations of monensin poisoning are well known. Equine species are particularly susceptible to monensin poisoning, and a common effect of monensin poisoning is vacuolization and/or swelling of mitochondria in striated muscle. Other pathological injuries to striated muscle, spleen, lung, liver and kidney also have been noted. A consistent observation is cardiac myocyte degeneration as well as vacuolization. Differences in cellular response resulting from exposure to monensin (i.e., Golgi apparatus swelling in cultured cells, isolated tissues, and plants vs.mitochondrial swelling in animals fed monensin) suggest that myocardial damage is due either to a monensin metabolite or is a secondary response to some other derivation. However, as pointed out by Bergen and Bates [26], the underlying mode of action of ionophores is on transmembrane ion fluxes which dissipate cation and proton gradients. Consequently, some or all of the observed monensin effects in vivo in animals could be secondary phenomena caused by disruption of normal membrane physiology resulting from altered ion fluxes.","publish_time":"1990-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mollenhauer, Hilton H.; James Morr\u00E9, D.; Rowe, Loyd D.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148783/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszNTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Monensin","Bates"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Monensin effects","effects of monensin","action of monensin","monensin of importance","affinity of monensin","low monensin concentrations","Golgi apparatus function","disruption of trans Golgi apparatus cisternae","stacked cisternae","severe toxicological manifestations of monensin poisoning","swelling of cisternae","non-acidic compartments","neutralization of acidic intracellular compartments","transmembrane exchange","ionic exchange","trans-membrane exchange of sodium ions","acidic endosome function","trans face","trans half","acid compartments","biological membranes","plant cells","ionophore-ion comples","low concentrations","complexes","animal species","host animal","endocytosis","net influx of protons","understood mechanisms","monovalent ion-selective ionophore","wide range of plant","lipid components of membranes","aqueous membrane interface","short exposure times","inward movement of ions","capable of collapsing Na","concomitant efflux of H","experimental tool","nonpolar hydrocarbon","nonpolar solvents","little tendency","biological systems","net effect","reversible action","osmotic uptake of water","intracellular degradation of internalized ligands","associated elements","terminal glycosylation","late processing events","ATP levels","lysosomes","proteolytic cleavages","molecular pathways of subcellular vesicular traffic","poultry","change of protein synthesis","secretory vesicles","high solubility","middle","great commercial value","point of exit","coccidiostat","active cations","ionophoric expression","rumen microflora","coccidia","tissues","changes","efficient utilization of feed","processes","certain endosomes","minimum of troublesome","outer surface","benefits","cattle","observations","biochemical configuration","electron micrographs","calcium","acceptance","apparent consequence","nearest competitor","\u03BCM","shuttle","advantages","inhibitions","gradients","interactions","internalization","processed molecules","monensin metabolite","observed monensin effects","common effect of monensin poisoning","animals","secondary response","vacuolization","mitochondrial swelling","striated muscle","transmembrane ion fluxes","altered ion fluxes","secondary phenomena","cellular response","plants vs","disruption of normal membrane physiology","isolated tissues","spleen","ionophores","cultured cells","cardiac myocyte degeneration","cation","Golgi apparatus","exposure","consistent observation","underlying mode of action","lung","liver","proton gradients","Equine species","kidney","pathological injuries","Differences","myocardial damage","Bates","derivation","Bergen"],"language":"en"},

The pathologic hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the presence of focal demyelinated lesions with partial axonal preservation and reactive astrogliosis. Demyelinated plaques are present in the white as well as gray matter, such as the cerebral or cerebellar cortex and brainstem nuclei. Activity of the disease process is reflected by the presence of lesions with ongoing myelin destruction. Axonal and neuronal destruction in the lesions is a major substrate for permanent neurologic deficit in MS patients. The MS pathology is qualitatively similar in different disease stages, such as relapsing remitting MS or secondary or primary progressive MS, but the prevalence of different lesion types differs quantitatively. Acute MS and Balo\u0027s type of concentric sclerosis appear to be variants of classic MS. In contrast, neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are inflammatory diseases with primary injury of astrocytes, mediated by aquaporin-4 antibodies. Finally, we discuss the histopathology of other inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated demyelination.

However, contradictory results have also been presented, and the mechanistic explanation is lacking. Methods: A panel of cell lines (Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK), adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549), lung epithelial type I (LET1)) and primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE) susceptible to influenza virus infection were infected with a seasonal influenza A virus in the presence or absence of BBR. Cytotoxicity towards cell lines was measured using XTT assay. The yield of the virus was analyzed using RT-qPCR. To study the molecular mechanism of BBR, confocal microscopy and Western blot analyses of cellular fractions were applied. Results and conclusions: Our results show cell-type-dependent anti-influenza properties of BBR in vitro which suggests that the compound acts on the cell and not the virus. Importantly, BBR hampers influenza replication in primary human airway epithelium 3D cultures that mimic the natural replication site of the virus. Studies show that the influenza A virus upregulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway and hijacks this pathway for nucleolar export of the viral ribonucleoprotein. Our results suggest that BBR interferes with this process and hampers influenza A replication.","publish_time":"2020-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Botwina, Pawe\u0142; Owczarek, Katarzyna; Rajfur, Zenon; Ochman, Marek; Urlik, Maciej; Nowakowska, Maria; Szczubia\u0142ka, Krzysztof; Pyrc, Krzysztof","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/efb0b18cb1660cb51083f55f64f5df55aa7e5687.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150991.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150991/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BBR","XTT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus infection","BBR hampers influenza replication","seasonal influenza","absence of BBR","dependent anti-influenza properties of BBR","cell-type","molecular mechanism of BBR","block replication","primary human airway epithelial cells","contradictory results","panel of cell lines","primary human airway epithelium","lung epithelial type","pathway","natural replication site","adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cells","therapeutic properties","extracellular signal-related kinase","mitogen-activated protein kinase","HAE","MDCK","A549","confocal microscopy","D cultures","Madin","Darby canine kidney","MAPK","Western blot analyses of cellular fractions","LET1","ERK","presence","variety of biological","nucleolar export","isoquinoline alkaloid","process","viral ribonucleoprotein","Berberine","XTT assay","Methods","conclusions","compound acts","Background","RT-qPCR","Cytotoxicity","Studies","mechanistic explanation","yield"],"language":"en"},

The prescription of enterosorbents is appropriate as a primary measure for the treatment of the acute diarrhea for effective prevention of the fluid and electrolyte loss, as well as method for symptom relief of the attack of the disease. Aim of the study - the antidiarrheal efficacy and safety study of high-dispersion silicon dioxide enterosorbent in tablet dosage form in patients with acute diarrhea. This was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-center study. Acute diarrhea was defined as three and more episodes of watery stool per day either during 48 hours or less before study entry in the patients having normal stool recently. It has been postulated that symptoms and signs of acute diarrhea have to be caused by direct infection of the gastrointestinal tract and did not associated with moderate-to-severe systemic states. 144 patients with established acute diarrhea were randomized into treatment group (enterosorbent \u201CCarbowhite\u201D, n = 120) or placebo group. Date collection including severity diarrhea, systemic symptoms was performed at baseline and daily during 7 days. Stool examination and serological assay were performed at baseline. The primary end points were declared as time to complete recovery from acute diarrhea. It has been found that the use of the siliceous enterosorbent (\u201CCarbowhite\u201D) allowed to reduce (p \u003C 0.001) the treatment period averagely for 0.9 days (95% confidence interval 0.5\u20131.2 days) in comparison with placebo. Data of safety monitoring has revealed that both patient groups had negative stool culture, while initiation of antibiotic treatment was run more frequently in placebo group (8.3%) compared to investigational product group (4.1%, P = 0.044).

In the present study, samples were collected from 148 wild birds, representing 14 species, which were being offered for sale in LBM. All birds were tested for the presence of AIV and enterobacteriaceae. Ten samples collected from Northern Shoveler birds (Spatula clypeata) were positive for IAV and PCR sub-typing and pan HA/NA sequencing assays detected H5N8, H9N2, and H6N2 viruses in four, four, and one birds, respectively. Sequencing of the full haemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed a high similarity with currently circulating IAV in Egypt. From all the birds, E. coli was recovered from 37.2% and Salmonella from 20.2%, with 66\u201396% and 23\u201343% isolates being resistant to at least one of seven selected critically important antimicrobials (CIA), respectively. The presence of enzootic IAV and the wide prevalence of AMR enterobacteriaceae in wild birds highlight the potential role of LBM in the spread of different pathogens from and to wild birds.

These vectors may also be designed to co-express type I interferon inducing innate immune agonist genes that have an adjuvant effect. Nanoplasmid vaccinated mice had increased antibody responses as compared to those receiving our conventional pWRG7077-based vaccines when delivered by IM injection, and these responses were further enhanced by the inclusion of the innate immune agonist genes. The Nanoplasmid VEEV DNA vaccines also significantly increased protection against aerosol VEEV challenge as compared to the pWRG7077 VEEV DNA vaccine.

When aspiration is suspected, antibiotics to cover anaerobes are frequently used, but in the absence of clear risk factors, current guidelines have questioned their role. It is unknown how frequently these guidelines are followed. METHODS: We conducted a single\u2010centre observational study on practice patterns of anaerobic antibiotic use in consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with aspiration pneumonia (Asp), community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare\u2010associated pneumonia (HCAP). RESULTS: A total of 192 patients were studied (Asp: 20, HCAP: 107, CAP: 65). Overall, 59 patients received anaerobic antibiotics (Asp: 90%, HCAP: 28%, CAP 17%) but a significant proportion of these patients did not meet criteria to receive them. Inappropriate anaerobic antibiotic use was 12/20 for Asp, 27/107 for HCAP and 9/65 for CAP. Mortality probability model III at zero hours (MPM0) score and a diagnosis of Asp were predictors of receiving inappropriate anaerobic antibiotics. Receiving inappropriate anaerobic antibiotics was associated with a longer ICU length of stay (LOS; 7 days (interquartile range (IQR): 7\u201321) vs 4 days (IQR:2\u20139), P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: For patients in the ICU admitted with pneumonia, there is a high occurrence of inappropriately prescribed anaerobic antibiotics, the use of which was associated with a longer ICU LOS.","publish_time":"2017-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kioka, Mutsumi J.; DiGiovine, Bruno; Rezik, Mohamed; Jennings, Jeffrey H.","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cb7a9ff07a30c0573c75eb52724a717bd9ada885.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7158857.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158857/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0Nzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU","HCAP","CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["inappropriate anaerobic antibiotics","prescribed anaerobic antibiotics","associated pneumonia","HCAP","diagnosis of Asp","Inappropriate anaerobic antibiotic use","aspiration pneumonia","consecutive patients","longer ICU LOS","practice patterns of anaerobic antibiotic use","longer ICU length of stay","days","IQR","current guidelines","common admitting diagnosis","centre observational study","intensive care unit","hours","absence of clear risk factors","high occurrence","community","healthcare","predictors","MPM0","Mortality probability model","OBJECTIVE","interquartile range","score","significant proportion","role","vs","RESULTS","total","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","METHODS","criteria","anaerobes"],"language":"en"},

Affected animals usually had diarrhoea and were in poor condition or emaciated. A number were moribund or dead when submitted for necropsy. Thickening of the caecal and colonic mucosa was the only gross lesion attributable to Y. pseudotuberculosis infection, with liver or other visceral abscesses not being seen. Characteristic microabscesses were demonstrated in the intestinal mucosa of 10 sheep, one goat and one pig infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III and one goat infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype I. Sheep, goats and pigs dosed orally with Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III, the serotype isolated most commonly from these species, developed intestinal infection. In sheep and pigs, infection was accompanied by diarrhoea. Haematological changes and specific antibodies were elicited in all 3 species in response to infection. Microabscesses were seen in the intestinal mucosa of all experimentally exposed animals. The occurrence of field cases and the results of experimental exposure confirm that Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III is an enteropathogen of sheep, goats and pigs. The association of Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype I with lesions in a goat, indicates that this bacterium may also be a pathogen of this species. It is concluded that Y. pseudotuberculosis serotype III is an enteric pathogen of a wide range of ungulate species including cattle, buffalo, deer, antelopes, sheep, goats and pigs. Serotypes I and II, while having a more restricted host range, are probably also pathogens of ungulates and, in particular, deer, antelopes and goats.","publish_time":"2008-03-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"SLEE, KJ; BUTTON, C","journal":"Aust Vet J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3254648215b13f7b0074f5260afcc3bf7ef74485.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158859/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["III"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pseudotuberculosis infection","Yersinia pseudotuberculosis serotype","pigs","goats","enteropathogen of sheep","intestinal infection","intestinal mucosa","deer","antelopes","wide range of ungulate species","colonic mucosa","infections","diarrhoea","enteric pathogen","exposed animals","Characteristic microabscesses","restricted host range","cattle","buffalo","gross lesion attributable","results of experimental exposure","occurrence of field cases","liver","features","specific antibodies","pathogens of ungulates","Haematological changes","visceral abscesses","number","necropsy","SUMMARY","poor condition","bacterium","response","lesions","association of"],"language":"en"},

Randomized controlled trials (RCT) proved them to have globally acceptable safety and tolerability profiles. However, life-threatening complications are rare events and RCT are underpowered to detect them. As these drugs became more widely prescribed in clinical practice, and particularly, having the information from multiple national biologics registries available, serious adverse events became perceptible. Infection remains the major concern, but other serious and life-threatening complications have emerged, such as malignancies, congestive heart failure, demyelinating disorders, and drug-induced autoimmune syndromes. Several of these are correlated with either the underlying disease or concomitant immunosuppressive medication. Most of them can be avoided by the adoption of preventive measures and an early proper management might significantly change the outcome. Awareness of the possible serious side effects is of utmost importance for a safer use of biological agents. In this chapter, we aim to describe the most commonly reported life-threatening complications of biological therapies in the literature \u2013 including those with antitumor necrosis factor agents, rituximab, abatacept, tocilizumab, and anakinra.

In stable PICU patients, RBC transfusion is probably not required if the hemoglobin concentration is above 7 g/dL, unless the patient has a cyanotic cardiac condition. The trigger or goal that should be used to direct RBC transfusion therapy in unstable critically ill children remains undetermined, although some data suggest that RBC transfusion may help in the early treatment of unstable patients with sepsis if their ScvO(2) is below 70 % after mechanical ventilation, fluid challenge, and inotropes/vasopressors perfusions have been initiated. Plasma and platelets are used to prevent or to treat hemorrhage attributable to a coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. The risks and benefits of plasma and platelet concentrates in PICU patients are discussed. There is almost no evidence at the present time that might permit a strong recommendation with regard to the use of plasma and platelets in PICU. Good knowledge of transfusion reactions is required in order to appropriately estimate the cost/benefit ratio of transfusion. Nowadays, non-infectious serious hazards of transfusion (NISHOT) are more frequent and more challenging for pediatric intensivists than transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases. The decision to prescribe a transfusion must be tailored to individual needs and repeated clinical evaluation of each critically ill child.","publish_time":"2014-05-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tucci, Marisa; Lacroix, Jacques; Gauvin, France; Toledano, Baruch; Robitaille, Nancy","journal":"Pediatric Critical Care Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4b19773f64d22549497c215cc152b99088d9a778.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120437.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120437/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RBC","PICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["direct RBC transfusion therapy","benefit ratio of transfusion","non-infectious serious hazards of transfusion","Good knowledge of transfusion reactions","stable PICU patients","Severe anemia","use of plasma","benefits of plasma","platelets","early treatment of unstable patients","pediatric intensivists","ill children","platelet dysfunction","pediatric intensive care units","repeated clinical evaluation","fluid challenge","inotropes","coagulopathy","thrombocytopenia","NISHOT","individual needs","sepsis","strong recommendation","regard","cost","red blood cell","data","present time","mechanical ventilation","vasopressors perfusions","infectious diseases","cyanotic cardiac condition","hemorrhage attributable","risks","order","ScvO","hemoglobin concentration","evidence","goal","risk of death","trigger","decision"],"language":"en"},

Here we review how these trait-mediated indirect effects of parasites can alter the outcomes of invader-native interactions, illustrating with examples from the literature and with particular regard to the invader-native crustacean systems studied in our laboratories. Parasites may potentially inhibit or exacerbate invasions via their effects on host behaviour, in addition to their direct virulence effects on hosts. In several crustacean systems, we have found that parasites influence both host predation rates on intra- and inter-guild prey and host vulnerability to being preyed upon. These trait effects can theoretically alter invasion impact and patterns of coexistence, as they indirectly affect interactions between predators and prey with the potential for further ramifications to other species in the food web. The fitness consequences of parasite-induced trait-mediated effects are rarely considered in traditional parasitological contexts, but demand attention in the context of ecological communities. We can regard these trait effects as a form of cryptic virulence that only becomes apparent when hosts are examined in the context of the other species with which they interact.","publish_time":"2015-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hatcher, Melanie J.; Dick, Jaimie T.

Neurologic Complications in Hospitalized Pediatric Patients with Influenza Infection, A Multicenter Retrospective Study in Korea","doi":"10.1093/ofid/ofy210.731","pmcid":"PMC6254533","pubmed_id":null,"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of influenza associated neurologic complications (IANCs) in hospitalized pediatric patients in Korea. METHODS: We performed retrospective review of hospitalized cases of confirmed influenza infection from October 2010 to April 2017. Patient\u2019s data were collected from three referral hospitals in different regions of the country. RESULTS: A total 2,002 laboratory confirmed influenza cases were identified. The median age was 3.3 years old (range 0.0\u201318.9 years) and 1,003 patients were male (54%). Influenza A was diagnosed in 1,357 cases (68%), influenza B in 624 (31%) and both influenza A and B in 21 (1%). Other combined respiratory virus infection was detected in 104 (5.2%) cases. Out of 2,002 cases, IANCs were identified in 167 cases (8.3%); influenza virus A was detected in 116 (69.4%), B in 50 (29.9%) and both A and B in one case (0.6%). Of 167 cases with IANCs, 25 patients (15%) had underlying neurologic diseases. Eleven patients (11/167, 6.5%) had combined respiratory viral infection (Rhinovirus = 5; respiratory syncytial virus = 3; coronavirus = 2; and bocavirus = 1). The most common diagnosis was a simple febrile seizure (112/167, 67.1%), followed by other seizures (26/167, 15.6%), encephalopathy/encephalitis (17/167, 10.2%), meningitis (7/167, 4.2%), meningism (4/167, 2.4%) and acute ataxia (1/167, 0.6%). In two patients with encephalitis/meningitis, one patient had influenza A and the other patient had influenza B detected by PCR in cerebrospinal fluid. Most of the patients were fully recovered (162/167, 97%) and no neurologic complication occurred in patients who had only initial manifestation of simple febrile seizure. Ten patients (10/167, 6.0%) required hospitalization in intensive care unit. Three patients (3/167, 1.8%) died of encephalopathy (n = 1) and combined encephalopathy/myocarditis (n = 2). Pre-existing neurologic disease was a risk factor of IANCs with an odds ratio of 3.94 (95% confidence interval 2.37 to 6.56, P \u003C 0.0001). CONCLUSION: IANCs is not rare and may cause serious outcome including death. Clinicians should be aware of the increased risk for IANCs in certain patients with neurologic diseases.

Septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greatest risk of mortality, and septic shock is clinically identified as sepsis patients with serum lactate level \u003E2 mmol/L and who require vasopressor infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure \u2265 65 mm Hg in the absence of hypovolemia. Sepsis is among the most common conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), accounting for up to half of all hospital deaths and being the third leading cause of death overall in the United States.(2) Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies for which treatment and resuscitation should begin immediately. The goals of fluid resuscitation for these patients are: a) to rapidly replace intravascular volume and restore tissue perfusion, and b) to minimize organ dysfunction through timely interventions that either halt or reverse the physiologic derangements. If hypoperfusion is present, at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given rapidly, and additional fluids should be guided by frequent reassessment of hemodynamic status, preferably using dynamic indices to indicate the likelihood of a beneficial response to fluid administration. Fluid administration should be targeted to achieve a MAP of at least 65 mm Hg, and to normalize lactate in patients with elevated lactate due to hypoperfusion.(3) Balanced crystalloids are the fluid of first choice for sepsis resuscitation based on ready availability and taking medication costs into account. Use of 0.9% saline compared to a balanced crystalloid, such as lactated Ringer\u0027s or PlasmaLyte, produces more kidney dysfunction and with a greater risk of dying.(4) The individual side effect profiles may best differentiate the natural and synthetic colloids. Albumin may be considered for administration to sepsis patients with refractory shock or who have received substantial amounts of crystalloid fluids, but should not be administered to patients with severe traumatic brain injury.(5) Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) products should not be administered to patients with sepsis because of increased risk of acute kidney injury and death. Gelatin solutions are not recommended in sepsis. Norepinephrine is the vasopressor of first choice for patients with septic shock, and should be administered to achieve a mean arterial pressure of at least 65 mm Hg after excluding hypovolemia as a cause for hypotension. The selection of a second line vasopressor, such as vasopressin, dopamine, phenylephrine, epinephrine or angiotensin-2, depends on patient factors such as underlying cardiac dysfunction, presence of arrhythmias, and current response to vasoconstrictor or inotropic agents. Dopamine should not be used for renal perfusion or protection and it should be avoided in patients with tachyarrhythmias.","publish_time":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Greg S.","journal":"Qatar Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cc44d4c57c66a9c62c60fa0e3908462e812987c1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6851923.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851923/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs4OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["sepsis patients","sepsis resuscitation","subset of sepsis","septic shock","fluid administration","Optimal fluid resuscitation","goals of fluid resuscitation","refractory shock","kidney dysfunction","Hg","life-threatening organ dysfunction","underlying cardiac dysfunction","current response","choice","beneficial response","greater risk","elevated lactate","vasopressor infusion","mean arterial pressure","line vasopressor","dopamine","hypoperfusion","increased risk of acute kidney injury","substantial amounts of crystalloid fluids","dysregulated host response","greatest risk of mortality","serum lactate level","leading cause of death","Balanced crystalloids","tissue perfusion","renal perfusion","additional fluids","absence of hypovolemia","severe traumatic brain injury","presence of arrhythmias","ready availability","intensive care unit","medical emergencies","metabolic abnormalities","vasoconstrictor","halt","vasopressin","common conditions","likelihood","infection","frequent reassessment of hemodynamic status","Hydroxyethyl starch","patient factors","lactated Ringer\u0027s","accounting","dynamic indices","ICU","medication costs","angiotensin","phenylephrine","inotropic agents","products","timely interventions","PlasmaLyte","mmol","treatment","hospital deaths","United States","effect profiles","half","HES","intravascular volume","synthetic colloids","physiologic derangements","protection","selection","hypotension","saline","Norepinephrine","Gelatin solutions","MAP","Albumin","tachyarrhythmias"],"language":"en"},

An improved method for quick and accurate detection of E. tarda by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with two additional loop primers was developed by targeting the EsrB gene (EsrB \u2014 LAMP). In this method, the Mg(2\u002B) concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time were optimized to 8 mmol/L, 61\u00B0C, and 40 min, respectively. The detection limit with the EsrB gene was as low as 10 copies, which is 100 times more sensitive than that of conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The EsrB-LAMP assay was shown more sensitive and rapid than previously reported LAMP assays targeting the hemolysin gene ( hemolysin -LAMP) for detection of E. tarda. The EsrB -LAMP was also highly specific to E. tarda and had no cross-reaction with 13 other strains of bacteria. The assay can be carried out in a simple heating device and the EsrB-LAMP products can be visually detected by adding fluorescent dye to the reaction mixture. Taken together, the improved EsrB-LAMP diagnostic protocol has the potential for detection of E. tarda from indoor and outdoor samples.","publish_time":"2012-07-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xie, Guosi; Zhang, Qingli; Han, Nana; Shi, Chengyin; Wang, Xiuhua; Liu, Qinghui; Huang, Jie","journal":"Chin","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/97e1ac66089a96ab66a4dd2bcde8bb7aaaa87e02.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087700/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Edwardsiella"],"organizations":["LAMP","EsrB -LAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EsrB -LAMP","EsrB-LAMP assay","EsrB-LAMP products","hemolysin -LAMP","EsrB gene","improved EsrB-LAMP diagnostic protocol","reported LAMP assays","Edwardsiella tarda","hemolysin gene","accurate detection of","reaction time","reaction temperature","detection limit","reaction mixture","improved method","conventional polymerase chain reaction","additional loop primers","aquatic environments","major pathogen","potential","isothermal amplification","PCR","simple heating device","heavy economic losses","times","copies","mmol","fluorescent dye","cross-reaction","outdoor samples","concentration","strains of bacteria"],"language":"en"},

Instead of commonly used micro particles an optical tagging of the flow has been performed by using a caged dye. The pattern generation is done by imaging a mask for the first time. This allows to generate nearly any imaginable pattern. The flow induces a deformation of the optically written pattern that can be tracked by laser induced fluorescence. The series of raw images acquired in this way were analyzed quantitatively with a novel optical flow based technique. The reference measurements have been carried out allowing to draw conclusions about the accuracy of this procedure. A comparison to the standard technique of \u03BCPIV has also been conducted. Apart from measuring flow velocities in microfluidic mixing processes, the spatial distribution of concentration fields for different species has also been measured. To this end, a new technique has been developed that allows spatial measurements from Planar Spontaneous Raman Scattering (PSRS). The Raman stray light of the relevant species has been spectrally selected by a narrow bandpass filter and thus detected unaffectedly by the Raman stray light of other species. The successful operation of this measurement procedure in micro flows will be demonstrated exemplary for a mixing process of water and ethanol.","publish_time":"2007-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Roetmann, Karsten; Schmunk, Waldemar; Garbe, Christoph S.; Beushausen, Volker","journal":"Exp Fluids","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c1f0aecc734cff6882905a2d6755211eeebafa90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087862.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087862/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs5NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel optical flow","Raman stray light","measuring flow velocities","spatial measurements","different species","optical tagging","micro flows","micro particles","relevant species","micro mixer","new technique","pattern generation","written pattern","imaginable pattern","standard technique of \u03BCPIV","spatial distribution of concentration fields","Planar Spontaneous Raman Scattering","measurement procedure","velocity fields","reference measurements","microfluidic mixing processes","mixing process of water","dimensional molecular tagging velocimetry","D-MTV","PSRS","successful operation","way","ethanol","comparison","deformation","series of raw images","laser induced fluorescence","mask","narrow bandpass filter","conclusions","accuracy","end","caged dye","time"],"language":"en"},

Different cell confluencies, DNA/reagent ratios and total transfection volumes were optimized for two chemical reagents including jetPEI\u2122 and Lipofectamine\u2122 2000. Besides, the effects of electric field strength and pulse length were investigated to improve electroporation efficiency. Transfection of cells by pEGFP-N1 vector and tracking the expression of GFP by FACS and Fluorescence Microscopy analysis were the employed methods to evaluate transfection efficiencies. Optimized electroporation protocols yielded 63.73 \u00B1 2.36 and 73.9 \u00B1 1.6% of transfection in Huh-7 and Vero cells respectively, while maximum achieved level of transfection by jetPEI\u2122 was 14.2 \u00B1 0.69 and 28 \u00B1 1.11% Huh-7 and Vero cells, respectively. Post transfectional chilling of the cells did not improve electrotransfection efficiency of Huh-7 cells.

The neurons were cultured in a two-chamber system allowing infection via the neuritic extensions exclusively. The effects of 30 MAbs on viral replication of the encephalitis-derived HSV-1 strain 2762 and its less neuroinvasive variant 2762p11 were assayed in this model. One MAb reactive with gD gave a nine-fold reduction of the virus yields of both strains. One MAb directed against gB gave an enhanced virus yield of strain 2762, but not of the 2762p11 variant. Another gB-reactive MAb decreased the virus yield of strain 2762p11, but not of 2762 after neuritic infection. The findings indicate that an alteration of gB has occurred during the passage of the strain 2762. Mutants of the same strain were derived by infecting hybridomas producing MAb reactive with gB, gC, gD and gE, respectively. The gB hybridoma mutant showed a significantly lower neuroinvasiveness in the DRG model, and was non-virulent after snout infection of mice. We suggest that the structure of gB of the strain 2762 is of importance for the neuroinvasiveness of this strain.","publish_time":"2004-12-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bergstr\u00F6m, T.; Sj\u00F6gren-Jansson, E.; Jeansson, S.; Lycke, E.","journal":"Mol Cell Probes","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135814/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsxMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DRG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gB-reactive MAb","alteration of gB","structure of gB","virus yield of strain 2762p11","enhanced virus yield of strain","MAb reactive","coded glycoproteins gB","gD","gB hybridoma mutant","model of neuroinvasiveness","DRG model","neuritic infection","2762p11 variant","gC","herpes simplex virus","MAbs","lower neuroinvasiveness","neuroinvasive variant 2762p11","encephalitis-derived HSV","snout infection of mice","sensory neurons","neuritic extensions","rat dorsal root ganglion","viral replication","infecting hybridomas","cells","chamber system","effects","fold reduction","importance","Monoclonal antibodies","findings","passage","strains","Mutants"],"language":"en"},

New targeted and individualized therapies and drugs provide a survival benefit for an increasing number of patients, but can also cause severe side effects. An increasing number of oncology patients are admitted to intensive care units (ICU) because of cancer-related complications or treatment-associated side effects. Postoperative care, respiratory distress and sepsis are the leading causes for admission. Tumor mass syndromes and tumor lysis may require urgent treatment. Traditional anticancer chemotherapy is associated with infections and immunosuppression. Newer agents are generally well-tolerated and side effects are mild or moderate, but overwhelming inflammation and autoimmunity can also occur. Cellular treatment, such as with chimeric antigen receptor modified T\u2011cells, monoclonal and bispecific antibodies targeting immune effectors and tumor cells are associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with hypotension, skin reactions and fever. It is related to excessively high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Immune checkpoint inhibitors can lead to immune-related adverse events (IRAEs), such as colitis and endocrine disorders. Noninfectious respiratory complications, such as pneumonitis can also occur. Recent studies revealed that short-term and medium-term survival of cancer patients is better than previously expected. In this review article we summarize diagnostic and treatment strategies for common life-threatening complications and emergencies requiring ICU admission. Furthermore, strategies for rational admission policies are presented.","publish_time":"2018-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Annecke, Thorsten; Hohn, Andreas; B\u00F6ll, Boris; Kochanek, Matthias","journal":"Wien Klin Mag","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/37ab6d18c3d7cbd082281df83560420461b53a84.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138133.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138133/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyMTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["treatment-associated","treatment strategies","cancer-related complications","effects","tumor cells","urgent treatment","ICU admission","Cellular treatment","increasing number of patients","medium-term survival of cancer patients","tumor lysis","immune effectors","Noninfectious respiratory complications","immune-related adverse events","increasing number of oncology patients","common life-threatening complications","Tumor mass syndromes","Immune checkpoint inhibitors","leading causes of death","rational admission policies","survival benefit","Postoperative care","respiratory distress","intensive care units","bispecific antibodies","sepsis","hypotension","CRS","drugs","emergencies","individualized therapies","cytokine release syndrome","chimeric antigen receptor","IRAEs","infections","overwhelming inflammation","skin reactions","Recent studies","review article","Traditional anticancer chemotherapy","high levels of inflammatory cytokines","colitis","autoimmunity","Newer agents","fever","pneumonitis","endocrine disorders","immunosuppression"],"language":"en"},

This turnaround has decisively contributed to WHO\u0027s loss of leadership in HIV/AIDS politics. From the viewpoint of both rationalist and constructivist theories of international organisation (IO) agency, an IO engaging in \u2018mission shrink\u2019 is a striking irregularity. In order to account for such apparently self-defeating behaviour, this article adopts an open systems view of IOs and identifies trans-organisational coalitions as important agents of IO change. I argue that subunit dynamics rather than systemic conditions drive IO behaviour, in particular where member states\u2019 material power and their formal control of organisational veto positions do not coincide. This approach will be used to retrace the changes in subunit coalitions that drove WHO\u0027s erratic HIV/AIDS programme and thus to solve this puzzle of \u2018mission shrink\u2019. On the basis of insights from the WHO case, the article concludes by offering a heuristic of trans-organisational coalitions and the types of IO change associated with them.","publish_time":"2013-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hanrieder, Tine","journal":"J Int Relat Dev (Ljubl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c264d90ef8edf12cfe88f49e4fad1a87808555ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7140235.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7140235/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IO behaviour","types of IO change","subunit coalitions","AIDS programme","heuristic of trans-organisational coalitions","important agents of IO change","AIDS politics","article","mission","erratic HIV","self-defeating behaviour","subunit dynamics","formal control of organisational veto positions","member state support","renowned Global Programme","member states\u2019 material power","continued donor","constructivist theories of international organisation","systemic conditions","IOs","open systems","loss of leadership","agency","viewpoint","case","World Health Organization","basis of insights","striking irregularity","puzzle","changes","order","turnaround","approach"],"language":"en"},

From primary and secondary biosynthetic sites in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix, respectively, proteins and lipids are distributed to more than 30 final destinations in membranes or membrane-bound spaces, where they carry out their programmed function. Molecular sorting is defined, in its most general sense, as the sum of the mechanisms that determine the distribution of a given molecule from its site of synthesis to its site of function in the cell. The final site of residence of a protein in a eukaryotic cell is determined by a combination of various factors, acting in concert: (1) site of synthesis, (2) sorting signals or zip codes, (3) signal recognition or decoding mechanisms, (4) cotranslational or posttranslational mechanisms for translocation across membranes, (5) specific fusion\u2013fission interactions between intracellular vesicular compartments, and (6) restrictions to the lateral mobility in the plane of the bilayer. Improvements in cell fractionation, protein separation, and immune precipitation procedures in the past decade have made them possible. Very little is known about the mechanisms that mediate the localization and concentration of specific proteins and lipids within organelles. Various experimental model systems have become available for their study. The advent of recombinant DNA technology has shortened the time needed for obtaining the primary structure of proteins to a few months.","publish_time":"2008-05-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodriguez-Boulan, Enrique; Misek, David E.; Salas, Dora Vega De; Salas, Pedro J.I.; Bard, Enzo","journal":"Curr Top Membr Transp","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146842/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein sorting","site of synthesis","site of function","decoding mechanisms","posttranslational mechanisms","final site of residence","protein separation","membranes","concentration of specific proteins","primary structure of proteins","cell fractionation","sorting signals","eukaryotic cell","lipids","Molecular sorting","specific fusion","final destinations","programmed function","combination of various factors","Various experimental model systems","immune precipitation procedures","fission interactions","intracellular vesicular compartments","cytosol","past decade","time","secondary biosynthetic sites","mitochondrial matrix","cotranslational","zip codes","signal recognition","membrane-bound spaces","given molecule","translocation","Improvements","localization","advent of recombinant DNA technology","lateral mobility","plane","restrictions","sum","distribution","months","concert","secretory pathway","organelles","general sense","bilayer","study","chapter"],"language":"en"},

High-resolution F protein structures in both the metastable pre- and the postfusion conformation have been solved for several members of the families and a number of F-targeting entry inhibitors have progressed to advanced development or clinical testing. However, small-molecule RSV entry inhibitors have overall disappointed in clinical trials and viral resistance developed rapidly in experimental settings and patients, raising the question of whether the available structural information may provide a path to counteract viral escape through proactive inhibitor engineering.

Currently, there are no antiviral drugs available to treat flavivirus infections. We have previously discovered a broad-spectrum antiviral compound, benzavir-2, with potent antiviral activity against both DNA- and RNA-viruses. Our purpose was to investigate the inhibitory activity of benzavir-2 against flaviviruses. We used a ZIKV ZsGreen-expressing vector, two lineages of wild-type ZIKV, and other medically important flaviviruses. Benzavir-2 inhibited ZIKV derived reporter gene expression with an EC(50) value of 0.8 \u00B1 0.1 \u00B5M. Furthermore, ZIKV plaque formation, progeny virus production, and viral RNA expression were strongly inhibited. In addition, 2.5 \u00B5M of benzavir-2 reduced infection in vitro in three to five orders of magnitude for five other flaviviruses: WNV, YFV, the tick-borne encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and dengue virus. In conclusion, benzavir-2 was a potent inhibitor of flavivirus infection, which supported the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of benzavir-2.","publish_time":"2020-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gwon, Yong-Dae; Strand, M\u00E5rten; Lindqvist, Richard; Nilsson, Emma; Saleeb, Michael; Elofsson, Mikael; \u00D6verby, Anna K.; Evander, Magnus","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f304b4819a1e90568fc333941792d00d93fe386.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7150796.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjszODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV","EC"],"locations":["Central America","North America","Brazil"],"keyphrases":["Zika virus","dengue virus","\u00B5M of benzavir","broad-spectrum antiviral activity of benzavir","tick-borne encephalitis virus","Japanese encephalitis virus","inhibitory activity of benzavir","progeny virus production","Yellow fever virus","West Nile virus","type ZIKV","ZIKV ZsGreen","potent antiviral activity","important flaviviruses","ZIKV plaque formation","broad-spectrum antiviral compound","WNV","YFV","inhibited ZIKV derived reporter gene expression","antiviral drugs available","RNA-viruses","potent inhibitor of flavivirus infection","viral RNA expression","North America","Central America","flavivirus infections","reduced infection","African countries","Brazil","South","DNA","lineages of wild","mosquitoes","cause morbidity","ticks","vector","mortality","need","new regions","orders of magnitude","preparedness","value","purpose","addition","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The available algorithms enabling such decompositions present severe efficiency limitations and are an obstacle for the solution of large scale and high dimensional problems. Our main contribution is the improvement of the parallel efficiency of the parareal in time method. The parareal method is based on combining predictions made by a numerically inexpensive solver (with coarse physics and/or coarse resolution) with corrections coming from an expensive solver (with high-fidelity physics and high resolution). At convergence, the algorithm provides a solution that has the fine solver\u2019s high-fidelity physics and high resolution. In the classical version, the fine solver has a fixed high accuracy which is the major obstacle to achieve a competitive parallel efficiency. In this paper, we develop an adaptive variant that overcomes this obstacle by dynamically increasing the accuracy of the fine solver across the parareal iterations. We theoretically show that the parallel efficiency becomes very competitive in the ideal case where the cost of the coarse solver is small, thus proving that the only remaining factors impeding full scalability become the cost of the coarse solver and communication time. The developed theory has also the merit of setting a general framework to understand the success of several extensions of parareal based on iteratively improving the quality of the fine solver and re-using information from previous parareal steps. We illustrate the actual performance of the method in stiff ODEs, which are a challenging family of problems since the only mechanism for adaptivity is time and efficiency is affected by the cost of the coarse solver.","publish_time":"2020-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Maday, Y.; Mula, O.","journal":"J Comput Appl Math","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7155213.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155213/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs0MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coarse solver","inexpensive solver","coarse physics","time method","coarse resolution","parareal method","high resolution","competitive parallel efficiency","communication time","cost","parareal iterations","extensions of parareal","high dimensional problems","fine solver\u2019s high-fidelity physics","fixed high accuracy","time domain decomposition","previous parareal steps","numerical simulation of time dependent problems","major obstacle","paper","decompositions present severe efficiency limitations","challenging family of problems","solution of large scale","information","stiff ODEs","mechanism","available algorithms","merit","success","improvement","scalability","ideal case","adaptivity","predictions","corrections","quality","actual performance","general framework","adaptive variant","classical version","main contribution","remaining factors","developed theory","convergence"],"language":"en"},

To evaluate possible effects of ABHR applications on glove integrity, thirteen brands of nitrile and latex medical exam gloves from five manufacturers and two different ABHRs were included in this study. A pair of gloves were worn by a test operator and the outside surfaces of the gloves were separately treated with an ABHR for 1\u20136 applications. Tensile strength and ultimate elongation of the gloves without any ABHR treatments (control gloves) and gloves after 1\u20136 ABHR applications were measured based on the ASTM D412 standard method. In general, tensile strength decreased with each ABHR application. ABHRs had more effect on the tensile strength of the tested nitrile than latex gloves, while ethanol-based ABHR (EBHR) resulted in lesser changes in tensile strength compared to isopropanol-based ABHR (IBHR). The results show that multiple EBHR applications on the latex gloves and some of the nitrile gloves tested should be safe for Ebola PPE doffing based on the CDC guidance.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an empirical therapy of high-dose versus standard-dose meropenem in sepsis and septic shock patients. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized open-label study to compare the changes of modified sequential organ failure assessment (mSOFA) score and other clinical outcomes of the high-dose meropenem (2-g infusion over 3 h every 8 h) versus the standard-dose meropenem (1-g infusion over 3 h every 8 h) in sepsis and septic shock patients. Patients\u2019 characteristics, clinical and microbiological outcomes, 14 and 28-day mortality, vasopressor- and ventilator-free days, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital-free days, percent of the time of antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (%T\u003EMIC), and safety were assessed. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients were enrolled. Median delta mSOFA was comparable between two groups (\u2013 1 in the high-dose group vs. \u2013 1 in the standard-dose group; P value = 0.75). There was no difference between the two groups regarding clinical and microbiological cure, 14- and 28-day mortality, vasopressor- and ventilator-free days, and ICU- and hospital-free days. In patients admitted from the emergency department (ED) with a mSOFA score \u2265 7, the high-dose group demonstrated significantly better microbiological cure compared with the standard-dose group (75% (9/12 patients) vs. 20% (2/10 patients); P value = 0.03). Likewise, the high-dose group presented higher microbiological cure rate in patients admitted from ED who had either APACHE II score \u003E 20 (83.3% (10/12) vs. 28.6% (2/7); P value = 0.045) or on mechanical ventilator (87.5% (7/8) vs. 23.1% (3/13); P value = 0.008) than the standard-dose group. Adverse events were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical therapy with the high-dose meropenem presented comparable clinical outcomes to the standard-dose meropenem in sepsis and septic shock patients.

Their ability to track seasonal influenza and predict heightened winter healthcare burden in the light of high activity in Australia in 2017 was untested. METHODS: Four transmission models were used in forecasting the 2017/2018 seasonal influenza epidemic in England: a stratified primary care model using daily, region-specific, counts and virological swab positivity of influenza-like illness consultations in general practice (GP); a strain-specific (SS) model using weekly, national GP ILI and virological data; an intensive care model (ICU) using reports of ICU influenza admissions; and a synthesis model that included all data sources. For the first 12 weeks of 2018, each model was applied to the latest data to provide estimates of epidemic parameters and short-term influenza forecasts. The added value of pre-season population susceptibility data was explored. RESULTS: The combined results provided valuable nowcasts of the state of the epidemic. Short-term predictions of burden on primary and secondary health services were initially highly variable before reaching consensus beyond the observed peaks in activity between weeks 3\u20134 of 2018. Estimates for R(0) were consistent over time for three of the four models until week 12 of 2018, and there was consistency in the estimation of R(0) across the SPC and SS models, and in the ICU attack rates estimated by the ICU and the synthesis model. Estimation and predictions varied according to the assumed levels of pre-season immunity. CONCLUSIONS: This exercise successfully applied a range of pandemic models to seasonal influenza. Forecasting early in the season remains challenging but represents a crucially important activity to inform planning.

Therefore, they modulate trophic networks and biogeochemical cycles, regulate ecosystem productivity, and determine the ecology and health of plant and animal partners. A better understanding of these interactions is needed to develop microbe-based ecological engineering strategies for environmental sustainability and conservation, to improve environment-friendly approaches for feed and food production, and to address health challenges posed by infectious diseases. The main types of biotic interactions are presented: interactions between microorganisms, interactions between microorganisms and plants, and interactions between microorganisms and animals.","publish_time":"2014-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mo\u00EBnne-Loccoz, Yvan; Mavingui, Patrick; Combes, Claude; Normand, Philippe; Steinberg, Christian","journal":"Environmental Microbiology: Fundamentals and Applications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f2af34193386651787223abc820ccdd113359de7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122249.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122249/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxMDAw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interspecific interactions","simple short-term interactions","main types of biotic interactions","health of plant","large number of diversified microorganisms","animals","complex interaction networks","formation of plant","health challenges","activity level","animal kingdoms","animal partners","additional level of interaction complexity","trophic networks","microbial relations range","internal parts of plants","diversity patterns of microbial communities","conservation","ecological engineering strategies","environmental sustainability","food production","environment-friendly approaches","feed","biogeochemical cycles","ecology","ecosystem productivity","size","microbe","long-term ones","surface","infectious diseases","coevolution","key role","ecosystems","better understanding"],"language":"en"},

A unique feature of Strongyloides stercoralis infection is the occurrence of an autoinfection cycle which permits persistence of the parasite years after the normal host has left an endemic area. In this cycle, the rhabditiform larvae in the duodenojujenal portion of the small intestine transform directly into filariform (infective) larvae. The filariform larvae without leaving the body can reinfect the patient by penetrating the intestinal mucosa. This distinctive characteristic of Strongyloides, to persist and replicate within the host for decades, produces minimal or no symptoms. Immunocompromised patients may develop a fulminant illness due to a unique process in the life cycle of Strongyloides in which there are dramatic increases in the number of filariform larvae. In the hyperinfection syndrome, massive numbers of larvae migrate through the intestinal mucosa and into the lungs (the usual migration pattern) and disseminate to involve other organ systems not ordinarily a part of the life cycle of the parasite. Larvae may be found in the central nervous system, kidneys, liver, and almost any other organ.","publish_time":"2011-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grossman, Marc E.; Fox, Lindy P.; Kovarik, Carrie; Rosenbach, Misha","journal":"Cutaneous Manifestations of Infection in the Immunocompromised Host","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f0fa8139d1c0e508e1df78d2960fcde129671d8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122283.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122283/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Southeast Asia","Latin America"],"keyphrases":["rhabditiform larvae","number of filariform larvae","life cycle of Strongyloides","massive numbers of larvae","autoinfection cycle","intestinal mucosa","unique feature of Strongyloides stercoralis infection","intestinal nematode","distinctive characteristic of Strongyloides","unique process","normal host","parasite years","endemic area","southeastern USA","organ systems","Latin America","sub-Saharan Africa","duodenojujenal portion","small intestine transform","eastern Kentucky","Southeast Asia","liver","fulminant illness","parts","lungs","occurrence","highest prevalence rates","human threadworm","central nervous system","dramatic increases","kidneys","hyperinfection syndrome","persistence","usual migration pattern","millions of people","Immunocompromised patients","rural Tennessee","decades","body","symptoms"],"language":"en"},

Many microorganisms have been associated with bronchiectasis, both as a complication of the anatomic abnormalities and possibly as a cause of the structural disease as well [2, 3]. Diverse polymicrobial communities are present in the airways of patients with bronchiectasis [4]. Studies using standard microbiologic culture techniques have demonstrated the presence of bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens in the lungs of bronchiectasis patients both when the patient is clinically stable and when there is an exacerbation of disease [2, 5]. Newer molecular techniques have broadened our understanding of the microbiome in bronchiectasis patients [4, 6]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been repeatedly shown to be a problematic pathogen in patients with bronchiectasis and is associated with a worse prognosis [7, 8]. Multiple epidemiologic reports have shown that approximately 20\u201335% of patients worldwide with bronchiectasis are chronically infected with P. aeruginosa [2, 9, 10].

Marine sponges represent one of the extant metazoans of 700\u2013800 million years. They are classified in four major classes: Calcarea, Demospongiae, Hexactinellida, and Homoscleromorpha. Among them, three genera, namely, Haliclona, Petrosia, and Discodemia have been identified to be the richest source of biologically active compounds. So far, 15,000 species have been described, and among them, more than 6000 species are found in marine and freshwater systems throughout tropical, temperate, and polar regions. More than 5000 different compounds have been isolated and structurally characterized to date, contributing to about 30% of all marine natural products. The chemical diversity of sponge products is high with compounds classified as alkaloids, terpenoids, peptides, polyketides, steroids, and macrolides, which integrate a wide range of biological activities, including antibacterial, anticancer, antifungal, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, and antimalarial. There is an open debate whether all natural products isolated from sponges are produced by sponges or are in fact derived from microorganisms that are inhaled though filter-feeding or that live within the sponges. Apart from their origin and chemoecological functions, sponge-derived metabolites are also of considerable interest in drug development. Therefore, development of recombinant microorganisms engineered for efficient production of sponge-derived products is a promising strategy that deserves further attention in future investigations in order to address the limitations regarding sustainable supply of marine drugs.","publish_time":"2019-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Han, Bing-Nan; Hong, Li-Li; Gu, Bin-Bin; Sun, Yang-Ting; Wang, Jie; Liu, Jin-Tang; Lin, Hou-Wen","journal":"Symbiotic Microbiomes of Coral Reefs Sponges and Corals","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e5f65e5c8df2bfcda5d3e152feb0afbb476102b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122408.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122408/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs3OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Marine"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Marine sponges","derived products","marine natural products","sponge-derived metabolites","chemical diversity of sponge products","efficient production of sponge","active compounds","different compounds","species","sustainable supply of marine drugs","development of recombinant microorganisms","drug development","limitations","anti-HIV","Demospongiae","polyketides","order","attention","antifungal","terpenoids","alkaloids","chemoecological functions","promising strategy","wide range of biological activities","freshwater systems","Hexactinellida","Calcarea","macrolides","steroids","anti-inflammatory","peptides","future investigations","oldest multicellular invertebrates","major classes","Haliclona","Petrosia","world","polar regions","richest source","origin","extant metazoans","open debate","genera","Discodemia","Homoscleromorpha","fact","years","filter","date"],"language":"en"},

In 2011, worldwide there were over 800 new biotech drugs and treatments in development including 23 antisense, 64 cell therapy, 50 gene therapy, 300 monoclonal antibodies, 78 recombinant proteins, and 298 vaccines (PhRMA 2012). Pharmaceutical biotechnology techniques are at the core of most methodologies used today for drug discovery and development of both biologics and small molecules. While recombinant DNA technology and hybridoma techniques were the major methods utilized in pharmaceutical biotechnology through most of its historical timeline, our ever-widening understanding of human cellular function and disease processes and a wealth of additional and innovative biotechnologies have been, and will continue to be, developed in order to harvest the information found in the human genome. These technological advances will provide a better understanding of the relationship between genetics and biological function, unravel the underlying causes of disease, explore the association of genomic variation and drug response, enhance pharmaceutical research, and fuel the discovery and development of new and novel biopharmaceuticals. These revolutionary technologies and additional biotechnology-related techniques are improving the very competitive and costly process of drug development of new medicinal agents, diagnostics, and medical devices. Some of the technologies and techniques described in this chapter are both well established and commonly used applications of biotechnology producing potential therapeutic products now in development including clinical trials. New techniques are emerging at a rapid and unprecedented pace and their full impact on the future of molecular medicine has yet to be imagined.","publish_time":"2013-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sindelar, Robert D.","journal":"Pharmaceutical Biotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e257bf737c9dab09055b81aa1be988cfd015560.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122419.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122419/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["New techniques","Pharmaceutical biotechnology techniques","greater percentage of drug development","drug discovery","additional biotechnology-related techniques","hybridoma techniques","costly process of drug development of new medicinal agents","drug response","used applications of biotechnology","new biotech drugs","pharmaceutical research","biologics","understanding of human cellular function","disease processes","biological function","wealth of additional","better understanding","gene therapy","cell therapy","recombinant proteins","revolutionary technologies","human genome","innovative biotechnologies","potential therapeutic products","underlying causes of disease","recombinant DNA technology","diagnostics","major methods","association of genomic variation","impact","monoclonal antibodies","relationship","genetics","treatments","expectations","core","medical devices","clinical trials","novel biopharmaceuticals","future of molecular medicine","unprecedented pace","information","vaccines","technological advances","methodologies","chapter","historical timeline","small molecules","area","exponential rate","PhRMA","order"],"language":"en"},

A municipality and its public health services have to be prepared to adapt to their preparations to deal with what contemporary experiences and history reveal are the most likely physical hazards and diseases to impact it. The two main preparatives are first to be able to care for the injured during a hazard event at well-staffed and supplied hospitals and medical clinics or field hospitals. The second is to fill the basic needs of affected populations with clean water, food, shelter, toilets, waste collection, and if necessary power restoration. These primary responses will help to reduce the chance of an onset and spread of disease. It is important to activate search and rescue teams help citizens isolated or trapped by the event that did not or could not evacuate such as in the case of extreme weather and flooding. In addition, where there have been deaths, bodies should be recovered and interred as soon as possible in order to prevent sickness that might originate from them. For instances of collapsed structures with people trapped inside, equipment that can move debris and rescue people or recover the deceased is necessary as would be the case for less common strong earthquakes as well as some extreme storm events. What was just described may be a good template to follow, but in reality, many sea coast cities in developing and less developed countries do not have the resources to cope with severe hazards that might impact them. Here, the World Health Organization and developed nations, large and small, have sent in personnel, supplies, and equipment to help an impacted sea coast city (or inland city) in the past and will surely continue to do so in the future.","publish_time":"2019-07-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siegel, Frederic R.","journal":"Adaptations of Coastal Cities to Global Warming, Sea Level Rise, Climate Change and Endemic Hazards","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6e9ff454561c426da1f7b10b8981f1affb618e1d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122453.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Pacific Ocean"],"keyphrases":["sea coast cities","case of extreme weather","impacted sea coast city","extreme weather conditions","equipment","rescue people","extreme storm events","supplied hospitals","field hospitals","developed nations","inland city","storm surges","developed countries","hazard event","rescue teams","severe hazards","World Health Organization","likely physical hazards","common strong earthquakes","public health services","necessary power restoration","clean water","food","medical clinics","monsoons","shelter","waste collection","wind","Pacific Ocean coasts","history reveal","high category hurricanes","basic needs of affected populations","typhoons","heat waves","toilets","risk","contemporary experiences","drought","search","tsunamis","resources","citizens","floods","reality","instances of collapsed structures","municipality","personnel","diseases","deceased","debris","flooding","book","deaths","onset","chance","main preparatives","preparations","supplies","primary responses","good template","order","sickness","addition","bodies","future"],"language":"en"},

Among these, the trypsin-like serine proteases comprise one of the best characterized subfamilies due to their essential roles in blood coagulation, food digestion, fibrinolysis, or immunity. Trypsin-like serine proteases possess primary substrate specificity for basic amino acids. Most of the well-characterized trypsin-like proteases such as trypsin, plasmin, or urokinase are soluble proteases that are secreted into the extracellular environment. At the turn of the millennium, a number of novel trypsin-like serine proteases have been identified that are anchored in the cell membrane, either by a transmembrane domain at the N- or C-terminus or via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. Meanwhile more than 20 membrane-anchored serine proteases (MASPs) have been identified in human and mouse, and some of them have emerged as key regulators of mammalian development and homeostasis. Thus, the MASP corin and TMPRSS6/matriptase-2 have been demonstrated to be the activators of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and key regulator of hepcidin expression, respectively. Furthermore, MASPs have been recognized as host cell factors activating respiratory viruses including influenza virus as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. In particular, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to be essential for proteolytic activation and consequently spread and pathogenesis of a number of influenza A viruses in mice and as a factor associated with severe influenza virus infection in humans. This review gives an overview on the physiological functions of the fascinating and rapidly evolving group of MASPs and a summary of the current knowledge on their role in proteolytic activation of viral fusion proteins.","publish_time":"2018-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"B\u00F6ttcher-Friebertsh\u00E4user, Eva","journal":"Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34bc89cc5f26432a554b21ccd87769cc77f1ccf2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122464.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122464/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxMDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["membrane-anchored serine proteases","soluble proteases","number of novel trypsin","well-characterized trypsin","respiratory viruses","number of influenza","transmembrane protease serine S1 member","severe acute respiratory syndrome","severe influenza virus infection","cell membrane","Middle East respiratory syndrome","known proteolytic enzymes","evolving group of MASPs","proteolytic activation of viral fusion proteins","essential roles","transmembrane domain","host cell factors","best characterized subfamilies","key regulators of mammalian development","key regulator of hepcidin expression","SARS","primary substrate specificity","food digestion","ANP","blood coagulation","basic amino acids","fibrinolysis","atrial natriuretic peptide","summary","MERS","current knowledge","plasmin","glycosylphosphatidylinositol","C-terminus","physiological functions","homeostasis","TMPRSS2","coronaviruses","millennium","mice","humans","urokinase","pathogenesis","MASP corin","TMPRSS6","matriptase","GPI","overview","activators","immunity","linkage","review","turn","extracellular environment","mouse"],"language":"en"},

As a result of a wider analysis of past crisis-management feedback, we define the term crisis and propose a crisis-management cycle, along with a set of decision support activities. From a system point of view, crisis management functionalities are structured along three crucial steps: information gathering, situation understanding, and decision making. For each step, the processes involved are described and for each one some relevant techniques are proposed to implement the processes. For the information-gathering step, the use of ontology allows the building and structuring of a coherent \u00ADsituation model. The initial overall picture of the situation, obtained by some on-line \u00ADinformation extraction and fusion, is then consolidated in the situation understanding step to provide meaningful real-time situation awareness. This provides the essential base to derive the final decision-making step. In the decision phase, the context has a dual impact on the decision-making process; the context first constrains the resolution of the resource allocation problem, but it also contributes to discriminate between several resource allocation solutions. It is thus shown that each step of the crisis management process relies on the availability and quality of the crisis context, and that this in-time contextualisation is required to enhance the overall process of crisis management. To summarise, this chapter highlights the key role of situation understanding for crisis management and reveals the crucial necessity of in-time contextualisation at each step of the crisis management process.","publish_time":"2010-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aligne, Florence; Mattioli, Juliette","journal":"Supporting Real Time Decision-Making","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/340ede0eb91e0ea55a2977fcb0638a2c49896f54.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122508.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122508/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["crisis management process","crisis context","overall process of crisis management","crisis management functionalities","crisis-management cycle","term crisis","decision-making process","wider analysis of past crisis-management feedback","information-gathering step","key role of situation","coherent \u00ADsituation model","final decision-making step","contextualisation of information","meaningful real-time situation awareness","time contextualisation","decision making","decision phase","chapter","processes","on-line \u00ADinformation extraction","resource allocation problem","resource allocation solutions","crucial necessity","crucial steps","major role","set of decision support activities","initial overall picture","availability","structuring","building","use of ontology","dual impact","resolution","view","sense","quality","importance","essential base","result","fusion","system","relevant techniques"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, the greater incidences of cross contamination and overuse of drugs has contributed towards the development of drug resistant microbial strains making conditions even worse. Hospital acquired infections pose one of the leading complications associated with implantation of any biomaterial after surgery and critical care. In this regard, developing non-conventional antimicrobial agents which would prevent the aforementioned causes is under the quest. The rapid development in nanoscience and nanotechnology has shown promising potential for developing novel biocidal agents that would integrate with a biomaterial to prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. Metals with inherent antimicrobial properties such as silver, copper, zinc at nano scale constitute a special class of antimicrobials which have broad spectrum antimicrobial nature and pose minimum toxicity to humans. Hence, novel biomaterials that inhibit microbial growth would be of great significance to eliminate medical device/instruments associated infections. This chapter comprises the state-of-art advancements in the development of nano-antimicrobial biomaterials for biomedical applications. Several strategies have been targeted to satisfy few important concern such as enhanced long term antimicrobial activity and stability, minimize leaching of antimicrobial material and promote reuse.

In clinical studies, however, standard DNA injection alone generally induces low levels of transgene-specific immunity when compared to other vaccine approaches. In order to boost the immunogenicity of this platform, next-generation DNA vaccines require additional techniques such as the administration of electroporation. This new method involves the generation of a brief electric field in tissue around a local injection site that results in the transient poration, or permeabilization, of the cellular membranes. As a result, antigen-specific immune responses are greatly enhanced and are likely due to increased DNA uptake and antigen expression. Thus, electroporation-mediated DNA vaccination represents a promising new strategy for the elicitation of strong immune responses directed against the expressed antigen(s) and not the vector, and ongoing studies are currently underway to optimize the working parameters of this technique. Here, we review the uses of this technology in conjunction with vaccination and suggest future directions for its further exploration.","publish_time":"2010-12-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fagone, Paolo; Shedlock, Devon J.; Kemmerer, Stephen; Rabussay, Dietmar; Weiner, David B.","journal":"Clinical Aspects of Electroporation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9ae601d80762953a9f04abd3f2c5a3c77fe1c9d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122510.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122510/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["electroporation-mediated DNA vaccination","standard DNA injection","generation DNA vaccines","increased DNA uptake","antigen-specific immune responses","expressed antigen","antigen expression","elicitation of strong immune responses","specific immunity","new method","ongoing studies","clinical studies","administration of electroporation","desirable platform","promising new strategy","local injection site","tissue","low levels of transgene","additional techniques","brief electric field","conjunction","permeabilization","future directions","result","transient poration","working parameters","vector","technology","positive attributes","vaccine approaches","cellular membranes","uses","exploration","immunogenicity","order"],"language":"en"},

It is the etiologic agent of bovine tritrichomonosis, a sexually transmitted disease in extensively managed herds throughout many geographic regions worldwide. The same trichomonad species is also regarded as the causative agent of chronic diarrhea in the domestic cat, although more recent studies observed molecular differences between bovine- and feline-derived T. foetus. Trichomonosis in cats has a worldwide distribution and is mainly present among cats from high-density housing environments. Other trichomonads are found as inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract in birds, such as Trichomonas gallinae. Particularly, Columbiformes, Falconiformes, Strigiformes, and wild Passeriformes can be severely affected by avian trichomonads. Diagnosis of trichomonosis is often complicated by the fragility of the parasite. To ensure valid test results, it is essential to collect and handle specimens in the right way prior to analysis. Cultivation tests, the specific amplification of parasites, or a combination of both test methods is the most efficient and most commonly used way to diagnose trichomonosis in animals. Bovine tritrichomonosis is mainly controlled by the identification and withdrawal of infected animals from bovine herds. The control of feline and avian trichomonosis relies mainly on preventive measures.","publish_time":"2017-11-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Coll\u00E1ntes-Fern\u00E1ndez, Esther; Fort, Marcelo C.; Ortega-Mora, Luis M.; Schares, Gereon","journal":"Parasitic Protozoa of Farm Animals and Pets","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65ee6e17cb11a7aa7da1068d44656d0074faee78.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122547.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122547/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsxNTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["T. foetus"],"organizations":["Tritrichomonas"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bovine herds","avian trichomonosis","Diagnosis of trichomonosis","etiologic agent of bovine tritrichomonosis","cats","avian trichomonads","managed herds","right way","used way","Tritrichomonas foetus","feline-derived","control of feline","known trichomonad","test methods","worldwide distribution","trichomonad species","withdrawal of infected animals","valid test results","causative agent of chronic diarrhea","recent studies","domestic cat","birds","veterinary medicine","molecular differences","transmitted disease","handle specimens","specific amplification of parasites","Falconiformes","Strigiformes","inhabitants","combination","high-density housing environments","identification","gastrointestinal tract","Cultivation tests","wild Passeriformes","geographic regions","analysis","preventive measures","Trichomonas gallinae","Columbiformes","fragility"],"language":"en"},

In the present chapter, the diagnostic workup of the syndrome will be presented with particular attention to microbiological investigations which represent a milestone in the diagnostic process and to imaging techniques such as CT scan and lung ultrasound. Despite the treatment is mainly based on supportive strategies, attention should be applied to assure adequate respiratory gas exchange while minimizing the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) onset. Therefore will be described several therapeutic approaches to ARDS, including noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV), high-flow nasal cannulas (HFNC) and invasive ventilation with particular emphasis to risks and benefits of mechanical ventilation, PEEP optimization and lung protective ventilation strategies. Rescue techniques, such as permissive hypercapnia, prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, inhaled vasodilators, corticosteroids, recruitment maneuvers and extracorporeal life support, will also be reviewed.

Opportunities for therapeutic intervention were limited to only a few applications such as herpesvirus infections, influenza, and HIV/AIDS; hence, once a bacterial or fungal infection was excluded, clinicians were limited to providing supportive care for what was presumed to be a viral syndrome. Public health organizations tracked the incidence of viral infections and the development of resistance to the few antiviral drugs in use and provided input to governments and the pharmaceutical industry regarding selection of vaccine targets. More recently, interest in viral diagnostics has burgeoned with the advent of new tools for detection and discovery, global recognition of pandemic risk, high-throughput drug screening, rational drug design, and immunotherapeutics. An additional impetus has been the implication of viruses in chronic illnesses not previously attributed to infection.

The appropriate investigational technique, specific differential diagnoses, and particular risks of these patients need to be understood by referring physicians as well as by radiologists. Thus, communication and cooperation, also including other clinical disciplines such as pulmonology, are required. Early detection of an infectious focus is the major goal in febrile neutropenic patients. As pneumonia is the most common focus, chest imaging is a special radiological task. The sensitivity of chest x-ray, especially in supine position, is low. Therefore, the very sensitive thin-section multislice CT became a gold standard in neutropenic hosts and might be cost effective in comparison to antibiotic treatment. CT-based localization can be used to guide invasive procedures in order to obtain samples for microbiological workup. Furthermore, the radiological characterization of infiltrates gives a first and rapid hint to discriminate between infectious (viral, typical bacterial, atypical bacterial, fungal) and noninfectious etiologies. Radiological follow-up has to take into account aspects according to disease, immune recovery, and treatment modalities. Due to a high incidence of fungal-related lung infiltrates, interpretation of follow-up findings must include further parameters besides lesion size. Apart from the lungs, also other organ systems such as the brain, liver, and paranasal sinuses need attention and are to be imaged with the appropriate technique.","publish_time":"2014-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heussel, Claus Peter","journal":"Infections in Hematology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/576ddc3a5c0337327ed4bf908ecd4d5f18953008.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122774.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122774/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjsyNjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Radiological follow-up","febrile neutropenic patients","management of neutropenic patients","infectious focus","neutropenic hosts","radiological characterization of infiltrates","special radiological task","appropriate technique","Radiologists","appropriate investigational technique","chest imaging","common focus","special role","antibiotic treatment","treatment modalities","related lung infiltrates","high incidence of fungal","interpretation of follow-up findings","section multislice CT","sensitivity of chest x-ray","CT-based localization","specific differential diagnoses","gold standard","major goal","immune recovery","order","samples","brain","liver","disease","particular risks","account aspects","paranasal sinuses","supine position","parameters","organ systems","invasive procedures","rapid hint","noninfectious etiologies","cooperation","clinical disciplines","microbiological workup","attention","comparison","Early detection","lesion size","pulmonology","lungs","pneumonia","communication","physicians"],"language":"en"},

They were produced by the cold-ethanol fractionation methods and did not make an exception. Noninfectious severe AEs occurred while infectious AEs were rarely reported. Indeed, prior to the introduction of mass screening for infection markers of plasma donations, inadvertent transmission of HIV to recipients of factor VIII and factor IX concentrates did occur, while IgG concentrates obtained from the same plasma pool did rarely transmit HIV (Morgenthaler 2001). Rare transmissions were restricted to products not exposed to low pH. The very few incidences of HIV and some incidences of HCV transmission by IgG concentrates in the early 1990s together with many cases of coagulation factor concentrates transmitted viral disease clearly demonstrated the need to establish standardized measures to render plasma products pathogen safe. In the second half of the 1990s, authorities shifted regulatory emphasis from a scientific review of the processes to a focus on compliance to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). The focus on cGMP compliance was applied to all aspects of plasma fractionation and the clinical use of plasma products.

The chapter goes on to discuss the global public health risk of excluding Taiwan from cross-national health cooperation, and why such a conundrum remains difficult to resolve. Taiwan\u2019s compliance regarding health governance relies heavily on self-regulation and the help of its allies. The United States has played a key role in enforcing global health regulations on Taiwan. Unlike other sources of threat in health governance, Taiwan currently does not represent a high health risk to other countries. As a result, Taiwan finds it difficult to persuade WHO members to manifest \u201Cuniversal participation\u201D by including Taiwan in various intergovernmental health networks.

Effective treatment, however, was not possible at that time; prevention and spread of infectious diseases depended solely on proper hygienic means. At the beginning of the twentieth century, passive and active vaccination procedures were developed against a number of these PATHOGENIC MICRO-ORGANISMS to prevent the diseases in question (rabies, diphtheria, tetanus, etc.). Thanks to the discovery of antimicrobial chemicals (by Paul Ehrlich) and antibiotics (by Sir Alexander Fleming), the threat of infectious diseases seemed to be minimised. Large-scale vaccination programmes against childhood diseases (diphtheria, whooping cough, and polio), started in the early 1950s, raised hopes of finally being able to eradicate these diseases from the planet. This approach was successful for smallpox (1980). However, new infectious diseases have emerged [e.g., Legionella, HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV), Helicobacter, SARS, etc.], and new vaccines and antibiotics are needed. Furthermore, due to intensive medical treatment with antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs, hospital infections are a growing problem. Bacteria hitherto deemed harmless are causing OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS in immunocompromised patients. The pathogens have developed resistance to many antibiotics, and sometimes no effective antibiotics are available to treat these patients.","publish_time":"2019-02-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Verhoef, Jan; van Kessel, Kok; Snippe, Harm","journal":"Nijkamp and Parnham\u0027s Principles of Immunopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/946e62bf6580de3863474f86115e69e2d6a49d55.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123078.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Paul Ehrlich","Alexander Fleming"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new infectious diseases","childhood diseases","effective antibiotics","threat of infectious diseases","diphtheria","century","Effective treatment","hospital infections","OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS","PATHOGENIC MICRO-ORGANISMS","immunocompromised patients","new vaccines","active vaccination procedures","Large-scale vaccination programmes","intensive medical treatment","immunosuppressive drugs","HIV","Paul Ehrlich","Legionella","whooping cough","question","discovery of antimicrobial chemicals","HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS","Sir Alexander Fleming","Helicobacter","polio","number","rabies","prevention","proper hygienic means","growing problem","hopes","Thanks","SARS","tetanus","time","approach","smallpox","Bacteria","beginning","pathogens","resistance","middle","planet"],"language":"en"},

Compartmental models are the most common class of models. They are very effective for qualitative analysis, but they rely on simplifying assumptions, such as homogeneous mixing and time scale separation. On the other end of the spectrum, detailed agent-based models, based on realistic mobility pattern models, provide extremely accurate predictions. However, these models require significant computing power and are not suitable for analytical treatment. Our research aims at bridging the gap between these two approaches, toward time-varying network models that are sufficiently accurate to make predictions for real-world applications, while being computationally affordable and amenable to analytical treatment. We leverage the novel paradigm of activity driven networks (ADNs), a particular type of time-varying network that accounts for inherent inhomogeinities within a population. Starting from the basic incarnation of ADNs, we expand on the framework to include behavioral factors triggered by health status and spreading awareness. The enriched paradigm is then utilized to model the 2014\u20132015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) spreading in Liberia, and perform a what-if analysis on the timely application of sanitary interventions in the field. Finally, we propose a new formulation, which is amenable to analytical treatment, beyond the mere computation of the epidemic threshold.","publish_time":"2017-10-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rizzo, Alessandro; Porfiri, Maurizio","journal":"Temporal Network Epidemiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d28414be3f9299ce8d1202386214db67845fafa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123080.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs0MjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Compartmental"],"locations":["Liberia"],"keyphrases":["Compartmental models","Models of epidemic spreading","time-varying network models","common class of models","analytical treatment","detailed agent-based models","realistic mobility pattern models","accurate predictions","field","particular type of time","time scale separation","steer interventions","qualitative analysis","epidemic threshold","enriched paradigm","basic incarnation of ADNs","novel paradigm of activity","timely application of sanitary interventions","homogeneous mixing","specific intervention scenarios","networks","spectrum","mere computation","significant computing power","EVD","health status","behavioral factors","outbreak","inherent inhomogeinities","real-world applications","approaches","simplifying assumptions","Ebola Virus Disease","end","framework","new formulation","gap","Liberia","awareness","population","evolution","research"],"language":"en"},

In the pregnant patient, pneumonia is the most common cause of fatal non-obstetric infection (1\u20133). Pneumonia can have adverse consequences for both the mother and her fetus, with certain infections (particularly viral and fungal) assuming greater virulence and mortality than in non-pregnant women of similar age (2, 3). Pneumonia is a relatively common cause of respiratory failure in pregnant patients, but in contrast to older studies, newer data suggest that not all pneumonias are more common or more serious in pregnant women than in other populations. However, because pneumonia can impact both the mother and fetus, it may lead to an increased likelihood of complicated preterm delivery, compared to pregnancies in which infection is absent. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are similar in pregnant and non-pregnant patients, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and influenza A accounting for the majority of cases (2\u20134). However, reduction in cell-mediated immunity associated with pregnancy (especially during the third trimester) places women at an increased risk of more severe forms of pneumonia and disseminated diseases from pathogens normally contained by this type of immune response, including herpes virus, influenza, varicella, and coccidioidomycosis (3, 5\u20137).","publish_time":"2008-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Khan, Samar; Niederman, Michael S.","journal":"Pulmonary Problems in Pregnancy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb60e76c4b6c91e4a061e69cd26a62870227ab29.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120499.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120499/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Streptococcus"],"organizations":["Community"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["non-pregnant patients","severe forms of pneumonia","non-pregnant women of similar age","common illness","common cause of fatal non-obstetric infection","common cause of respiratory failure","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Chlamydophila pneumoniae","places women","Community","mother","fetus","leading cause of death","increased risk","pathogens responsible","increased likelihood of complicated preterm delivery","Hemophilus influenzae","Legionella","contrast","mortality","herpes virus","greater virulence","newer data","pregnancies","accounting","older studies","certain infections","type of immune response","cell-mediated immunity","pregnancy","varicella","pneumonias","trimester","diseases","CAP","United States","reduction","adverse consequences","majority of cases","coccidioidomycosis","populations"],"language":"en"},

Severe viral infections are more common after unrelated and mismatched donor SCT and in particular after haploidentical SCT. B-cell function and specific antibodies are the main defense mechanisms against infection with exogenous viruses, thus reducing the risk for reinfection in already seropositive individuals. On the other hand, T-cell function in particular cytotoxic T-cell function is the main mechanism for preventing severe viral disease and also for the control of viruses such as herpesviruses that can cause latency and thus reactivate in an immunocompromised individual. The immune defects in SCT-patients are frequently complex with defects in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, helper T-lymphocyte, NK-cell, and B-lymphocyte functions. T-cell dysfunction is usually most important early after SCT while deficient B-cell reconstitution can remain for many years after SCT. Furthermore, since loss of specific antibodies occurs frequently over time after allogeneic SCT, this will also increase the risk for reinfections with previously encountered viruses such as measles or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and allow reactivation of viruses controlled by antibodies such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) [1, 2].","publish_time":"2009-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ljungman, Per","journal":"Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f9daf5d12348e0c95bbf256dc0ffd9dceda6d379.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120500.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsxMDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["allogeneic SCT","B-cell function","T-cell dysfunction","NK-cell","SCT-patients","haploidentical SCT","particular cytotoxic T-cell function","cytotoxic T-lymphocyte","deficient B-cell reconstitution","mismatched donor SCT","allogeneic stem cell transplantation","helper T-lymphocyte","exogenous viruses","encountered viruses","control of viruses","reactivation of viruses","Severe viral infections","hepatitis B virus","loss of specific antibodies","risk","severe viral disease","main mechanism","immune defects","main defense mechanisms","varicella-zoster virus","mortality","causes of morbidity","VZV","measles","time","seropositive individuals","herpesviruses","B-lymphocyte functions","HBV","reinfections","years","hand","latency","immunocompromised individual"],"language":"en"},

This is a broad topic, worthy of a book in its own right. This chapter will therefore provide only an overview of key concepts of drivers of the emergence of zoonotic diseases, and particularly infectious diseases with a major disease burden in humans. As the authors mainly work in Asia, the focus of this chapter is Asia, but many of the lessons learned in this region are likely to apply elsewhere. More than 60 % of the world population live in Asia, a region with some of the fastest developing economies in the world. Yet, despite tremendous advances, infectious diseases still remain a major burden for the human population in Asia. Of the estimated 2.1 million deaths in children aged less than 5 years in Southeast Asia in 2010, 47 % are attributable to infectious causes (Liu et al., Lancet 379:2151\u20132161, 2012). As such, Asia is both vulnerable to imported EIDs and a global focus of major social and environmental change that may facilitate the emergence and dissemination of new pathogens.

The analysis becomes especially problematic when the units analyzed are geographic areas and inferences are being made about individuals from the analysis for these geographic areas.","publish_time":"2011-03-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Siegel, Jacob S.","journal":"The Demography and Epidemiology of Human Health and Aging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2281cf6e33237b219a1f33c25a7e6b12dec14619.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120743.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120743/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyMTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["observations of individuals","measures of health status","summary measures","subnational geographic areas","socioeconomic groups","analysis","self-assessed health status","report","specific disease","particular death","record","countries","units","blood pressure","biomarker","individual\u2019s test","percentages","inferences","national populations","serum cholesterol","rates","field level","averages","problem"],"language":"en"},

Since then, several mammalian species have been shown to be susceptible to astroviruses which appear to be genetically diverse and to have acquired host-specificity. To date, astroviruses have been detected in 16 different orders or species of mammals in addition to humans, and signs of infection range from unapparent infection or very mild disease to diarrhea, lethargy, and anorexia, mainly observed in young individuals. This chapter describes those astroviruses detected in nonhuman mammalian species worldwide, as well as their molecular and phenotypic characteristics and their role in diseases. The capacity of these viruses to cross-species barriers and their subsequent adaptation to novel hosts is also highlighted.","publish_time":"2012-09-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cattoli, Giovanni; Chu, Daniel Ka Wing; Peiris, Malik","journal":"Astrovirus Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef4e43d93ed9d8c4cc2a7924d17a07c5526affe4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120767.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120767/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjsyMjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species of mammals","species barriers","reports of astroviruses","nonhuman mammalian species","diarrhea","unapparent infection","animals date","signs of infection range","humans","mild disease","subsequent adaptation","addition","phenotypic characteristics","role","anorexia","lethargy","lambs","different orders","novel hosts","diseases","end","infections","calves","young individuals","chapter","host-specificity","capacity","time"],"language":"en"},

One codon in a synonymous codon family is often strongly over-used, especially in highly expressed genes, which often leads to a high dN/dS ratio because dS is very small. Many different codon usage indices have been proposed to measure codon usage and codon adaptation. Sense codon could be misread by release factors and stop codons misread by tRNAs, which also contribute to codon usage in rare cases. This chapter outlines the conceptual framework on codon evolution, illustrates codon-specific and gene-specific codon usage indices, and presents their applications. A new index for codon adaptation that accounts for background mutation bias (Index of Translation Elongation) is presented and contrasted with codon adaptation index (CAI) which does not consider background mutation bias.

This UEE analysis is a subtle and detailed differentiation through assessment of BA feasibility in comparison with three other types of outbreak scenarios. There are two types of differences between these four scenarios: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative and quantitative differences are defined with 23 and 10 indicators, respectively. Both types of indicators can have three different values: N/A, 0 or 1. We have carried out a feasibility analysis for subtle and detailed differentiation among four outbreak scenarios.

System elimination is applied if one component contains all indicators scored with 0 or as N/A \u2013 the related scenario is then eliminated from further consideration. The system was applied to four UEEs: (1) an intentional attack by a deliberate use of a biological agent (Amerithrax), (2) a spontaneous outbreak of a new or re-emerging disease (\u201Cswine flu\u201D), (3) a spontaneous outbreak by an accidental release of a pathogen (Sverdlovsk anthrax), and (4) a spontaneous natural outbreak of a known endemic disease that may mimic bioterrorism or biowarfare (Kosovo tularemia). It was found that \u201Cagent\u201D was the most important and the most informative UEE component of the new scoring system. This system might be helpful in the analysis of unusual epidemic events and a quick differentiation between biological attacks and other epidemics.","publish_time":"2012-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Radosavljevic, Vladan","journal":"Biopreparedness and Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/104a8e3edb3282b77e0d96f999c8050a9427df1a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121225.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121225/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs0NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spontaneous outbreak","UEE analysis","feasibility analysis","types of outbreak scenarios","system of elimination","System elimination","spontaneous natural outbreak","\u0422his new method of outbreak analysis","new scoring system","types of indicators","detailed differentiation","quick differentiation","biological agent","types of differences","assessment of BA feasibility","analysis of unusual epidemic events","model of quick","informative UEE component","epidemics of panic","biological attacks","quantitative differences","original model of bioterrorism risk assessment","re-emerging disease","intentional attack","known endemic disease","unusual epidemiologic event","accurate evaluation","material resources","unnecessary expenditures","deliberate use","accidental release","comparison","false alarms","pathogen","money","confusion","time","biowarfare","Sverdlovsk anthrax","insufficient data","swine flu","different values","Kosovo tularemia","main obstacle","Amerithrax","related scenario","UEEs","tool","consideration"],"language":"en"},

Leukocytes modulate inflammation through production of secretory mediators, like cytokines and chemokines, which work in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. These mediators can either promote or attenuate the inflammatory response and depending on differential temporal and spatial expression play a crucial role in the outcome of infection. Even though the objective is clearance of the pathogen with minimum damage to host, the pathogenesis of multiple human pathogenic viruses has been suggested to emanate from a dysregulation of the inflammatory response, sometimes with fatal consequences. This review discusses the nature and the outcome of inflammatory response, which is triggered in the human host subsequent to infection by single-sense plus-strand RNA viruses. In view of such harmful effects of a dysregulated inflammatory response, an exogenous regulation of these reactions by either interference or supplementation of critical regulators has been suggested. Currently multiple such factors are being tested for their beneficial and adverse effects. A successful use of such an approach in diseases of viral etiology can potentially protect the affected individual without directly affecting the virus life cycle. Further, such approaches whenever applicable would be useful in mitigating death and/or debility that is caused by the infection of those viruses which have proven particularly difficult to control by either prophylactic vaccines and/or therapeutic strategies using specific antiviral drugs.","publish_time":"2019-11-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhattacharyya, Sankar","journal":"Dynamics of Immune Activation in Viral Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/443edc109644559a460ed76f2252d8c105d90201.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121364.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121364/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["outcome of inflammatory response","dysregulated inflammatory response","outcome of infection","Inflammation","pathogenesis of multiple human pathogenic viruses","human host subsequent","strand RNA viruses","harmful effects","adverse effects","production of secretory mediators","molecular responses","single-sense","therapeutic strategies","crucial role","differential temporal","exogenous regulation","concerted series of cellular","interference","disturbance of systemic homeostasis","spatial expression","minimum damage","diseases of viral etiology","toxins","mitigating death","affected individual","clearance","prophylactic vaccines","specific antiviral drugs","reactions","chemokines","cytokines","nature","supplementation of critical regulators","virus life cycle","Leukocytes","debility","fatal consequences","infectious organisms","successful use","paracrine manner","approaches","objective","factors","review","dysregulation"],"language":"en"},

These complications may involve injuries, aggression by pathogens, pollution, hormonal variations, genetic pre-disposition, unbalanced nutrition and onset of diseases. Although the microbial reconfiguration provoked by these stressors are not immediately evident as in the case of an afflicted visible organ where the abnormality is readily observable, the biological perturbations induced manifest themselves in form of various illnesses. The disruption of a working microbiome is referred to as dysbiosis and is a condition whereby the fine balance between the microbial communities and the host is distressed. Diseases such as cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, acne, gastric ulcers, obesity and hypertension can ensue. The pathogeneses of some pulmonary disorders, digestive complications and neurological abnormalities can be traced to the imbalance in the constituents of the microbiome. However, rebiosis, the re-establishment of the native microbiota is proving to be an excellent remedy against this condition. Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics are potent therapeutic tools designed to rectify this situation. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus spp are more or less like stem cells utilized to replenish and rejuvenate the microbiome while prebiotics like fructose oligosaccharides (FOS) are microbiome fertilizers akin to mineral supplements or energy nutrients aimed at promoting the proliferation of select microbes in the invisible organ. Synbiotics is a combination of both probiotics and prebiotics in a proper dosage aimed at remedying dysbiosis. The molecular understanding of dysbiosis and rebiosis will offer a very effective non-invasive means in preventing and curing diseases with probiotics and prebiotics. This will have a dramatic impact on our well-being.","publish_time":"2018-02-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Appanna, Vasu D.","journal":"Human Microbes - The Power Within","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/42150f8e237816e954dd33e0b899d2593c521729.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121371.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121371/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prebiotics","Probiotics","working microbiome","microbiome fertilizers akin","curing diseases","onset of diseases","rebiosis","synbiotics","remedying dysbiosis","condition","molecular understanding of dysbiosis","digestive complications","microbial communities","invisible organ","microbial reconfiguration","afflicted visible organ","rheumatoid arthritis","genetic pre-disposition","pollution","acne","hormonal variations","unbalanced nutrition","irritable bowel syndrome","manifest","gastric ulcers","mineral supplements","FOS","energy nutrients","pulmonary disorders","fructose oligosaccharides","numerous challenges","pathogens","abnormality","neurological abnormalities","aggression","cancer","proper dosage","life-span","biological perturbations","effective non-invasive means","potent therapeutic tools","proliferation","body","obesity","case","injuries","fine balance","components","form of various illnesses","hypertension","pathogeneses","native microbiota","stressors","re-establishment","microbes","imbalance","combination","excellent remedy","Lactobacillus spp","dramatic impact","well-being"],"language":"en"},

It explores the impact of these interventions in this Ebola pandemic, with a view towards possible future military deployments against health threats, and offers an initial analysis of the consequences thereof on the relationship between individual and state rights and responsibilities.","publish_time":"2017-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bindenagel \u0160ehovi\u0107, Annamarie","journal":"Coordinating Global Health Policy Responses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bca45283148e56273dcf7f2148db57ccb1417972.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121383/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs1NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ebola (Ebola Virus Disease"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Ebola pandemic","Ebola Virus Disease","state rights","ongoing HIV pandemic","military intervention","dilemmas of military response","Chapter","health threats","possible future military deployments","health crisis","international response","non-state actors","view","mediating","EVD","consequences","relationship","uses","initial analysis","time","wake","responsibilities","interventions","impact","questions"],"language":"en"},

Zn and Se are essential trace elements that play a pivotal role in immune functions and antioxidant defense and, consequently, are claimed to play also a role in successful aging trajectories. Consistently with their nature of essential trace elements, a plethora of data obtained \u201Cin vitro\u201D and \u201Cin vivo\u201D (in humans and animal models) support the relevance of Zn and Se for both the innate and adoptive immune response. Moreover, Zn and Se are strictly involved in the synthesis and regulation of activity of proteins and enzymes, e.g., metallothioneins (MT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), that are necessary for our endogenous antioxidant response. This is clearly important to protect our cells from oxidative damage and to slow the decline of our immune system with aging. Age-related changes affecting tissue levels of Zn and Se may indicate that the risk of Zn and Se deficiency increases with aging. However, it is still unclear which of these changes can be the consequence of a \u201Creal deficiency\u201D and which can be part of our physiological compensatory response to the accumulating damage occurring in aging. Furthermore, the upregulation of antioxidant proteins (Zn and Se dependent) may be a manifestation of self-induced oxidative stress. By the way, Zn and Se dependent proteins are modulated not only by nutritional status, but also by well-known hallmarks of aging that play antagonistic functions, such as the deregulated nutrient sensing pathways and cellular senescence. Thus, it is not an easy task to conduct Zn or Se supplementation in elderly and it is emerging consistent that these kind of supplementation requires an individualized approach. Anyway, there is consistent support that supplementation with Zn using doses around 10 mg/day is generally safe in elderly and may even improve part of immune performances in those subjects with a baseline deficiency. Regarding Se supplementation, it may induce both beneficial and detrimental effects on cellular immunity depending on the form of Se, supplemental dose, and delivery matrix. The nutritional association of supplements based on \u201CZn plus Se\u201D is hypothesized to provide additional benefits, but this will likely need a more complex individualized approach. The improvement of our knowledge around screening and detection of Zn and Se deficiency in aging could lead to substantial benefits in terms of efficacy of nutritional supplements aimed at ameliorate performance and health in aging.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mocchegiani, Eugenio; Malavolta, Marco","journal":"Handbook of Immunosenescence","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07694e8f832eb959b8c4a6a7ccfa3c94d9dbe8a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121636.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121636/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs2NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Se supplementation","Se deficiency","form of Se","detection of Zn","relevance of Zn","risk of Zn","Se dependent proteins","tissue levels of Zn","well-known hallmarks of aging","successful aging trajectories","immune functions","adoptive immune response","physiological changes","nutritional supplements","kind of supplementation","immune performances","immune system","baseline deficiency","real deficiency","upregulation of antioxidant proteins","endogenous antioxidant response","decline","antioxidant defense","physiological compensatory response","oxidative damage","nutritional association of supplements","Age-related changes","nutritional status","complex individualized approach","consistent support","nature of essential trace elements","pivotal role","cellular immunity","cellular senescence","antagonistic functions","accumulating damage","complex process","substantial benefits","additional benefits","manifestation of self-induced oxidative stress","deregulated nutrient sensing pathways","MT","metallothioneins","enzymes","supplemental dose","terms of efficacy","screening","GPX","glutathione peroxidase","detrimental effects","regulation of activity","increased susceptibility","knowledge","subjects","synthesis","doses","animal models","delivery matrix","plethora of data","easy task","day","diseases","cells","consequence","health","humans","improvement"],"language":"en"},

Darwin is hailed as one of the greatest scientist who put forth the theory of gradual evolution and branching of all life forms. Unfortunately, then fossil records were incomplete to produce evidence of human evolution. For 200 years paleobiologists were looking for any evidence of a transitional fossil to showcase the evolution of monkeys, apes and human. The story of Ida began in 1983 when she was collected from Messel pit in Germany by an unknown collector, and displayed in his home for 20 years before deciding to sell. The fossil Ida was preserved in nature for ages in the Germany\u2019s Messel pit, a crater rich in Eocene Epoch fossils. Ida lived when major changes were taking place on earth, the dinosaurs had become extinct, the Himalayas were forming and a range of mammals thrived in vast jungles all over the world. Prof. J\u00F8rn Hurum of the Natural History Museum, University of Oslo, Norway bought the fossil for 1 million USD, assembled top international team of experts, studied the fossil secretly for 2 years, and satisfied themselves as to the genuineness of the fossil. Finally Prof. J\u00F8rn Hurum announced the discovery of 47 million years old fossil \u2014 a link in the evolution of monkeys, apes and man. He named the fossil \u201CIda\u201D and her scientific name is Darwinius masillae (named in honor of Charles Darwin\u2019s bicentenary).

During the arenavirus life cycle, processing of the viral envelope glycoprotein precursor (GPC) by the cellular subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (SKI-1)/site-1 protease (S1P) is crucial for productive infection. The ability of newly emerging arenaviruses to hijack human SKI-1/S1P is a key factor for zoonotic transmission and human disease potential. Apart from being an essential host factor for arenavirus infection, SKI-1/S1P is involved in the regulation of important physiological processes and linked to major human diseases. This chapter provides an overview of the mechanisms of arenavirus GPC processing by SKI-1/S1P including recent findings. We will highlight to what extent the molecular mechanisms of SKI-1/S1P cleavage of viral GPC differ from processing of SKI-1/S1P\u2019s cellular substrates and discuss the implications for virus-host interaction and coevolution. Moreover, we will show how the use of the viral GPC as a \u201Cmolecular probe\u201D uncovered novel and unusual aspects of SKI-1/S1P biosynthesis and maturation. The crucial role of SKI-1/S1P in arenavirus infection and other major human diseases combined with its nature as an enzyme makes SKI-1/S1P further an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. In the last part, we will therefore cover past and present efforts to identify specific SKI-1/S1P inhibitors.","publish_time":"2018-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pasquato, Antonella; Cendron, Laura; Kunz, Stefan","journal":"Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2fc0d8e17d083f4160247749c145361b9f18f550.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121819.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121819/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GPC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human SKI","processing of SKI","specific SKI","S1P biosynthesis","S1P inhibitors","molecular mechanisms of SKI","S1P cleavage of viral GPC","crucial role of SKI","unusual aspects of SKI","arenavirus infection","mechanisms of arenavirus GPC processing","major human diseases","severe human pathogens","human disease potential","arenavirus life cycle","emerging arenaviruses","productive infection","essential host factor","viral envelope glycoprotein precursor","molecular probe","key factor","s cellular substrates","virus-host interaction","cellular subtilisin kexin isozyme","large family of emerging negative-stranded RNA viruses","zoonotic transmission","implications","hemorrhagic fevers","uncovered novel","nature","regulation of important physiological processes","high mortality","attractive target","present efforts","overview","therapeutic intervention","coevolution","protease","extent","site","enzyme","recent findings","chapter","ability","maturation"],"language":"en"},

When present, blood eosinophilia greater than 1 \u00D7 10(9) eosinophils/L (and preferably greater than 1.5 \u00D7 10(9)/L) is of considerable help for suggesting the diagnosis, however it may be absent, as in the early phase of idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia or when patients are already taking corticosteroids. On bronchoalveolar lavage, high eosinophilia (\u003E25 %, and preferably \u003E40 % of differential cell count) is considered diagnostic of eosinophilic pneumonia in a compatible setting, obviating the need of video-assisted thoracic surgical lung biopsy, which is now performed only on very rare occasions with inconsistency between clinical, biological, and imaging features. Inquiry as to drug intake must be meticulous (www.pneumotox.com) and any suspected drug should be withdrawn. Laboratory investigations for parasitic causes must take into account the travel history or residence and the epidemiology of parasites. In patients with associated extrathoracic manifestations, the diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis or of the hypereosinophilic syndromes should be raised. Presence of airflow obstruction can be found in hypereosinophilic asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or in the recently identified syndrome of hyperosinophilic obliterative bronchiolitis. Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of symptomatic treatment for eosinophilic pneumonias, with a generally dramatic response. Relapses are common when tapering the doses or after stopping treatment especially in idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. Cyclophosphamide is necessary only in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and poor-prognostic factors. Imatinib is very effective in the treatment of the myeloproliferative variant of hypereosinophilic syndromes.

Approaches to increase production addressing growth conditions, such as the improvement of media composition and process control, or transcription of the recombinant gene via the use of strong promoters/enhancers and amplification of gene copy number, have increased the yields obtained from mammalian cells considerably over the past decades. However these processes remain laborious, and extensive screening of clones is often required, as stable cell line and/or protein production is not always obtained. Unstable or variable expression is linked to the location of transgene integration site, the regulation of gene expression, the silencing of genes, and the loss of gene copies. Genetic elements that may remodel chromatin to maintain the transgene in an active configuration are now being employed increasingly to improve protein production using mammalian cells. Here we will review how one type of such elements, the MARs, may increase transgene integration into the cell genome and decrease silencing effects to reduce expression variability. We also illustrate how inclusion of these elements in expression vectors leads to increased specific productivities ranging from 20 to 100 picograms per cell and per day (p/c/d), resulting in protein titers above 5 g/l.","publish_time":"2009-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gorman, Cori; Arope, Salina; Grandjean, M\u00E9lanie; Girod, Pierre-Alain; Mermod, Nicolas","journal":"Cell Line Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e73dea1124bab4bff672d6ceaf2709b5039761ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121902.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121902/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs4MTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["protein production","recombinant gene","regulation of gene expression","mammalian cell systems","expression vectors","cell genome","variable expression","expression variability","protein titers","mammalian cells","percent of protein therapeutics","loss of gene copies","stable cell line","Genetic elements","amplification of gene copy number","location of transgene integration site","silencing effects","silencing of genes","recombinant proteins","use of strong promoters","increased specific productivities","enhancers","clinical development","process control","improvement of media composition","day","transcription","extensive screening of clones","challenge","yields","MARs","processes","growth conditions","picograms","past decades","chromatin","inclusion","biopharmaceutical industry","active configuration","type"],"language":"en"},

In this chapter, we discuss functional roles for alveolar epithelial cells with particular emphasis on intercellular junctions and communication. As a thin layer of cells directly exposed to atmospheric oxygen, alveoli are particularly sensitive to oxidant insults. Alcohol significantly diminishes the normal antioxidant reserves of the alveolar epithelium, thereby rendering it sensitized for an exaggerated damage response to acute and chronic injuries.

At present, the patients with acute liver failure should be managed in Intensive Care Unit where the therapy should be applied based on the specific etiology of the acute liver failure and it should be started as early as possible.","publish_time":"2019-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Toma, Diana; Lazar, Ovidiu; Bontas, Ecaterina","journal":"Liver Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3683a1d8ed8d6894d524617e6e2836a6ae887bc0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7122204.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122204/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE0LmNzdjs5Nzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1344305,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NsuCaHdyXdZBj4T8RT7n5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_14.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Intensive Care"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Acute liver failure","acute liver dysfunction","intensive care treatment","Intensive Care Unit","numerous advances","numerous complications","transplantation techniques","pathophysiology","multiorgan","poor prognosis","unpredictable disease","patients","simplified manner","specific etiology","decades","therapy","present","life-threatening situation","varied etiologies","hours","increased mortality"],"language":"en"},

An opposite approach was the refusal of the Eisenhower administration to mount a vaccination program to deal with the Asian flu pandemic of 1957. President Eisenhower was devoted to private solutions to such emergencies, and these were manifestly inadequate. There was yet another extreme example of a misguided approach, and that was President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s militant passivity to the 1918 influenza pandemic. Disregarding advice from medical consultants, he refused to discontinue the shipment of troops abroad to fight in the Great War, which resulted in an even greater spread of the contagion because of the great numbers of men confined to small quarters aboard ships. Incompetence can always be a danger in public health emergencies. Although this was not a pandemic, the George W. Bush administration handled the health crisis caused by Hurricane Katrina so poorly that it became a national scandal. On the other hand, President Bush did move to plan wisely for a possible influenza pandemic when he ordered the creation of national stockpiles of antiviral medication.","publish_time":"2016-10-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Skidmore, Max J.","journal":"Presidents, Pandemics, and Politics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05b01db5712e82013fc3f64fdfa2af0ef2bcb6fd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123304/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Eisenhower","Woodrow Wilson","George W.

The burden of infectious diseases worldwide, related to contamination via contact with contaminated surfaces (fomites), is a growing issue. Globally, these infections are linked to an estimated 1.7 million deaths a year from diarrheal disease and 1.5 million deaths from respiratory infections [1]. Apart from hospitals, the problem has become a growing liability at places where food is prepared and handled [2], where there is a growing risk associated with the cross-contamination of edible goods and where large amounts are handled by a single facility [3]. Already many E. coli and Salmonella outbreaks have been recorded and linked to single a facility [2, 4, 5]. The problem of cross-contamination via surfaces can also be traced, in smaller scale, to households where common areas can accumulate pathogens that can potentially become a threat, especially to more sensitive population groups [6].

Despite advances in vaccine and antiviral drug technology, each year over three million people die from a range of viral infections. Predominant viruses include human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis viruses, and gastrointestinal and respiratory viruses. Now more than ever, robust, easily mobilised and cost-effective antiviral strategies are needed to combat both known and emerging disease threats. RNA interference and small interfering (si)RNAs were initially hailed as a \u2018\u2018magic bullet\u2019\u2019, due to their ability to inhibit the synthesis of any protein via the degradation of its complementary messenger RNA sequence. Of particular interest was the potential for attenuating viral mRNAs contributing to the pathogenesis of disease that were not able to be targeted by vaccines or antiviral drugs. However, it was soon discovered that delivery of active siRNA molecules to the infection site in vivo was considerably more difficult than anticipated, due to a number of physiological barriers in the body. This spurred a new wave of investigation into nucleic acid delivery vehicles which could facilitate safe, targeted and effective administration of the siRNA as therapy. Amongst these, cationic polymer delivery vehicles have emerged as a promising candidate as they are low-cost and easy to produce at an industrial scale, and bind to the siRNA by nonspecific electrostatic interactions. These nanoparticles (NPs) can be functionally designed to target the infection site, improve uptake in infected cells, release the siRNA inside the endosome and facilitate delivery into the cell cytoplasm. They may also have the added benefit of acting as adjuvants. This chapter provides a background around problems associated with the translation of siRNA as antiviral treatments, reviews the progress made in nucleic acid therapeutics and discusses current methods and progress in overcoming these challenges. It also addresses the importance of combining physicochemical characterisation of the NPs with in vitro and in vivo data.","publish_time":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reynolds, Nicholas; Dearnley, Megan; Hinton, Tracey M.","journal":"Polymeric Gene Delivery Systems","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f209f24f242bc7a5b511229431304ba917ad418f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123685/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["translation of siRNA","delivery of active siRNA molecules","nucleic acid delivery vehicles","antiviral treatments","antiviral drugs","hepatitis viruses","Predominant viruses","respiratory viruses","progress","infection site","cationic polymer delivery vehicles","antiviral drug technology","Viral diseases","viral mRNAs","cost-effective antiviral strategies","NPs","nucleic acid therapeutics","range of viral infections","RNA interference","pathogenesis of disease","emerging disease threats","complementary messenger RNA sequence","human immunodeficiency virus","degradation","current methods","small interfering","new wave of investigation","infected cells","year","advances","promising candidate","problems","uptake","effective administration","major cause of death","number of physiological barriers","body","synthesis","background","protein","physicochemical characterisation","potential","people","vaccines","nonspecific electrostatic interactions","therapy","endosome","industrial scale","cell cytoplasm","added benefit","adjuvants","importance","chapter","challenges","magic bullet","ability","nanoparticles","data"],"language":"en"},

This chapter provides a broad overview of influenza, from basic virology to epidemiology, disease, treatment, and prevention.","publish_time":"2009-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sandrock, Christian","journal":"Management of Antimicrobials in Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b23de91188ba39c47a28fc2efb909b313754ffe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123779.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123779/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs4Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Influenza A.

This contribution from Peter Keller\u2019s celebratory publication on the occasion of his 20th presidency of the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism (AIEST) picks up on this assumption and discusses the touristic development and enhancement of strategic pricing over the past ten years of Swiss tourism. In the first section of this paper, empirical evidence of the development of Swiss tourism over time and a discussion of its challenges are presented. The second section addresses the postulated value-based pricing concept, including practical examples from Swiss tourism over the past ten years. The third section offers a conclusion, which discusses the relevance of strategic pricing as a means to strengthen competitiveness with respect to future terms. Peter Keller has been involved in scientific tourism research as the president of the AIEST for 20 years. Believing strongly in the fact that sustainable tourism research should be dedicated to a holistic, systemic as well as pragmatic approach, he constantly warned of disciplinary and autarchic traits of tourism research (Keller 2007, S. 96ff.). As an advocate of tourism science, which should be concerned with a human, social and cultural scientific reflection without excluding the viewpoint of economics or business administration, he also crucially influenced national tourism politics as a head of the Tourism Department at the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). In his article \u0022Strategic pricing policy as a chance for Swiss tourism\u0022 (Keller, 2003, S. 193ff.), he emphasises a \u0022back-to-growth strategy\u0022 for Swiss tourism by focusing on a strategic marketing approach, which is oriented towards the \u0022value-based pricing principle\u0022 and focuses more on price as a constitutive element. The following paper discusses the past development of the Swiss tourism industry since Peter Keller\u2019s article was published in 2003 and notes the valuebased pricing approach. For this purpose, we examine the development of Swiss tourism, outline the postulated \u0022value-based pricing principle\u0022 and discuss some practical applications from daily touristic business. Finally, we draw a conclusion about the applicability of strategic pricing in the future.","publish_time":"2014-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bandi, Monika; Friedli, Therese Lehmann","journal":"Tourism and Leisure","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34394b224833b988dcd00da2334bcf59825ac97d.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123928/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Peter Keller","S. 193ff"],"organizations":["the Tourism Department","State Secretariat for Economic Affairs","SECO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["development of Swiss tourism","years of Swiss tourism","Swiss tourism industry","Tourism Department","scientific tourism research","sustainable tourism research","strategic pricing policy","national tourism politics","advocate of tourism science","enhancement of strategic pricing","relevance of strategic pricing","applicability of strategic pricing","autarchic traits of tourism research","valuebased pricing approach","value-based pricing principle","postulated value-based pricing concept","past development","strategic marketing approach","touristic development","Peter Keller postulates","section","Peter Keller\u2019s article","Peter Keller\u2019s celebratory publication","competitiveness","AIEST","following paper","pragmatic approach","conclusion","cultural scientific reflection","daily touristic business","practical examples","practical applications","International Association of Scientific Experts","business administration","future terms","growth strategy","State Secretariat","chance","empirical evidence","viewpoint of economics","occasion","means","head","time","president","Economic Affairs","opportunity","SECO","human","presidency","respect","contribution","discussion","price","assumption","fact","constitutive element","challenges","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Such concern is driven by the widespread availability of radiological materials and the intentions of malfeasants and organizations around the world to do harm to others. In contrast to nuclear materials, radiological materials are ubiquitous and are found in most cities throughout the country at academic institutions, hospitals, and many businesses and industrial settings. In contrast, nuclear materials are difficult to access because of their rarity and the security of the settings in which they are found. A radiological or nuclear incident of any kind will require prompt assessment of the location and nature of the incident, activation of mass casualty response systems, followed by immediate consultation of hematology, health and medical physics, and nuclear medicine personnel. Radiation-induced injuries and illnesses are typically delayed. Successful assessment and management of individuals with acute radiation syndrome (ARS), including the hematopoietic subsyndrome (HS), is required to support management of injuries resulting from a high radiation dose, including injuries to the gastrointestinal and neurovascular systems. Administration of cytokines within 24 h of exposure shortens the period of granulocytopenia and is strongly recommended by subject matter experts in the management of the HS. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after failure of a 2\u20133 week trial of cytokines has been clearly documented and is weakly recommended in selected individuals with the HS. Administration of prophylactic and therapeutic broad-spectrum antimicrobials (including antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal agents) is recommended and should be guided by recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America for management of febrile neutropenia. This article provides an overview for clinicians who are called upon in a radiological and/or nuclear incident to manage individuals with ARS and other radiation-related illnesses.","publish_time":"2015-12-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dainiak, Nicholas; Goans, Ronald E.; Iddins, Carol J.; Case, Cullen","journal":"Oncologic Emergency Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09e3827759a604d6ad1a250d63e77d70427795b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7123937.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123937/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5Njg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Pentagon","Infectious Diseases Society of America"],"locations":["Pennsylvania"],"keyphrases":["nuclear materials","nuclear incident","management of injuries","management of individuals","widespread availability of radiological materials","HS","Radiation-induced injuries","nuclear medicine personnel","radiation-related illnesses","ARS","acute radiation syndrome","high radiation dose","management of febrile neutropenia","selected individuals","contrast","Administration of cytokines","prompt assessment","neurovascular systems","Successful assessment","Administration of prophylactic","hematopoietic subsyndrome","Public concern","industrial settings","week trial of cytokines","Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","activation of mass casualty response systems","medical physics","health","immediate consultation of hematology","therapeutic broad-spectrum antimicrobials","Infectious Diseases Society of America","New York City","hospitals","antiviral","failure","nature","intentions of malfeasants","possibility of terrorism","kind","academic institutions","organizations","Pentagon","country","terrorist attacks","cities","businesses","h of exposure","location","subject matter experts","period of granulocytopenia","world","antifungal agents","recommendations","rarity","article","overview","clinicians","harm","Pennsylvania","security"],"language":"en"},

Respiratory viruses, alone or in combination, are the most common cause. The course f illness can be complicated by bacterial agents, causing pharyngitis or sinusitis, but the are a rare cause of cold and flu-like illnesses (CFLIs). Our understanding of CFLI epidemiology has been enhanced by molecular detection methods, particularly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. PCR has not only improved detection of previously known viruses, but within the last decade has resulted in the detection of many divergent novel respiratory virus species. Human rhinovirus (HRV) infections cause nearly all CFLIs and they can be responsible for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. HRVs are co-detected with other respiratory viruses in statistically significant patterns, with HRVs occurring in the lowest proportion of co-detections, compared to most other respiratory viruses. Some recently identified rhinoviruses may populate an entirely new putative HRV species; HRV C. Further work is required to confirm a causal role for these newly identified viruses in CFLIs. The burden of illness associated with CFLIs is poorly documented, but where data are available, the impact of CFLIs is considerable. Individual infections, although they do not commonly result in more severe respiratory tract illness, are associated with substantial direct and indirect resource use. The product of frequency and burden for CFLIs is likely to be greater in magnitude than for any other respiratory syndrome, but further work is required to document this. Our understanding of the viral causes of CLFIs, although incomplete, has improved in recent years. Documenting burden is also an important step in progress towards improved control and management of these illnesses.","publish_time":"2009-11-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mackay, Ian M.; Arden, Katherine E.; Lambert, Stephen B.","journal":"Common Cold","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ed8bdefaa838cb3c37e603d0b86c12bf25e9c684.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123965/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE1LmNzdjs5ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1416040,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"Mgbko9tHn2A63vKIDUtlFQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_15.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CFLI","PCR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory viruses","respiratory syndrome","impact of CFLIs","identified viruses","severe respiratory tract illness","improved detection","burden of illness","known viruses","upper respiratory tract infection","common cause","divergent novel respiratory virus species","improved control","PCR","Documenting burden","HRVs","illnesses","result","work","common cold","rare cause of cold","new putative HRV species","molecular detection methods","course f illness","acute syndrome","Individual infections","combination of non-specific symptoms","understanding of CFLI epidemiology","lowest proportion of co-detections","polymerase chain reaction","fever","cough","asthma","sore throat","important step","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations","malaise","rhinorrhoea","progress","flu","bacterial agents","sinusitis","headache","indirect resource use","viral causes of CLFIs","testing","management","magnitude","significant patterns","causal role","product of frequency","pharyngitis","data","Human rhinovirus","recent years","myalgia","rhinoviruses","decade"],"language":"en"},

Modelling is possible because epidemics involve relatively simple processes occurring within large populations of individuals. Modelling aims to explain and predict trends in disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity or mortality. Epidemic models give important insight into the development of an epidemic. Following disease establishment, epidemic growth is approximately exponential. The rate of growth in this phase is primarily determined by the basic reproduction number, R(0), the number of secondary cases per primary case when the population is susceptible. R(0) also determines the ease with which control policies can control an epidemic. Once a significant proportion of the population has been infected, not all contacts of an infected individual will be with susceptible people. Infection can now continue only because new births replenish the susceptible population. Eventually an endemic equilibrium is reached where every infected person infects one other individual on average. Heterogeneity in host susceptibility, infectiousness, human contact patterns and in the genetic composition of pathogen populations introduces substantial additional complexity into this picture, however \u2013 and into the models required to model real diseases realistically. This chapter concludes with a brief review of the recent application of mathematical models to a wide range of emerging human or animal epidemics, most notably the spread of HIV in Africa, the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic in British livestock, bioterrorism threats such as smallpox, the SARS epidemics in 2003 and most recently the use of modelling as a tool for influenza pandemic preparedness planning.","publish_time":"2009-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ferguson, Neil M.","journal":"Medicine (Abingdon)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108383.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108383/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs1MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["Epidemic models","epidemic growth","mouth epidemic","susceptible population","infectious disease epidemics","animal epidemics","SARS epidemics","infected individual","recent application of mathematical models","disease incidence","disease establishment","infected person","susceptible people","use of modelling","rate of growth","human contact patterns","large populations of individuals","number of secondary cases","basic reproduction number","wide range of emerging human","genetic composition of pathogen populations","British livestock","infectiousness","substantial additional complexity","tool","foot","bioterrorism threats","primary case","host susceptibility","simple processes","prevalence","smallpox","brief review","influenza pandemic preparedness planning","important insight","Africa","morbidity","trends","development","spread of HIV","new births","mortality","Heterogeneity","picture","phase","endemic equilibrium","chapter","average","significant proportion","real diseases","policies","contacts","Infection"],"language":"en"},

This increase is partly explained by changes in food processing and consumption patterns that lead to the worldwide availability of high-risk food. As a result, vast outbreaks may occur due to contamination of food by a single foodhandler or at a single source. Although there are numerous fecal\u2013orally transmitted viruses, most reports of foodborne transmission describe infections with Norwalk-like caliciviruses (NLV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), suggesting that these viruses are associated with the greatest risk of foodborne transmission. NLV and HAV can be transmitted from person to person, or indirectly via food, water, or fomites contaminated with virus-containing feces or vomit. People can be infected without showing symptoms. The high frequency of secondary cases of NLV illness and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 of hepatitis A following a foodborne outbreak results in amplification of the problem. The burden of illness is highest in the elderly, and therefore is likely to increase due to the aging population. For HAV, the burden of illness may increase following hygienic control measures, due to a decreasing population of naturally immune individuals and a concurrent increase in the population at risk. Recent advances in the research of NLV and HAV have led to the development of molecular methods which can be used for molecular tracing of virus strains. These methods can be and have been used for the detection of common source outbreaks. While traditionally certain foods have been implicated in virus outbreaks, it is clear that almost any food item can be involved, provided it has been handled by an infected person. There are no established methods for detection of viruses in foods other than shellfish. Little information is available on disinfection and preventive measures specifically for these viruses. Studies addressing this issue are hampered by the lack of culture systems. As currently available routine monitoring systems exclusively focus on bacterial pathogens, efforts should be made to combine epidemiological and virological information for a combined laboratory-based rapid detection system for foodborne viruses. With better surveillance, including typing information, outbreaks of foodborne infections could be reported faster to prevent further spread.","publish_time":"2002-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koopmans, Marion; von Bonsdorff, Carl-Henrik; Vinj\u00E9, Jan; de Medici, Dario; Monroe, Steve","journal":"FEMS Microbiol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62aca7f0b1d46795c95667709c97899eb01507ee.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8eb480e4a5a2f0d3f865e77fd399caa5c5d4de0a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110323.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110323/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs1NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Foodborne","NLV","HAV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["foodborne viruses","outbreaks of foodborne infections","detection of viruses","virus outbreaks","HAV","transmitted viruses","reports of foodborne transmission","burden of illness","contamination of food","food processing","food item","greatest risk of foodborne transmission","foodborne outbreak results","causes of illness","research of NLV","detection of common source outbreaks","vast outbreaks","concurrent increase","infected person","typing information","virological information","hepatitis","high frequency of secondary cases of NLV illness","Little information","single source","worldwide availability of high-risk food","decreasing population","molecular tracing of virus strains","development of molecular methods","aging population","established methods","rapid detection system","waterborne viral infections","preventive measures","single foodhandler","following hygienic control measures","available routine","certain foods","lack of culture systems","combined laboratory","consumption patterns","immune individuals","disinfection","changes","Norwalk","amplification","fomites","caliciviruses","bacterial pathogens","better surveillance","lesser extent","efforts","problem","elderly","feces","Recent advances","issue","vomit","humans","shellfish","People","symptoms","Studies","spread"],"language":"en"},

The epidemiology of these viruses has not been extensively studied in immunocompromised hosts, but is probably closely related to viral activity in immunocompetent hosts, who constitute the virus reservoir for immunocompromised patients. In these patients, common respiratory viruses may cause severe infections with higher rates of progression to pneumonia and mortality compared to immunocompetent individuals. Prolonged high-titre viral shedding is common in patients with haematological malignancies and may enhance not only viral transmission, but also the selection of resistant strains. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections have been particularly well studied. They are associated with pneumonia rates of about one-third for influenza and 30\u201340% for RSV. Both viruses are responsible for mortality rates ranging from 15% to 30%. The exact mechanisms of pneumonia related to these viruses remains unknown, but bacterial and fungal co-infections are frequent and must be carefully investigated. Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and RSV have also been linked to late airflow obstruction in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Neuraminidase inhibitor therapy has been suggested for influenza, ribavirin for RSV, and cidofovir for adenovirus infections. However, there is no evidence supporting the use of these drugs, and randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to better define the optimal management of common viral pneumonia in patients with haematological malignancies. The absence of proven effective treatments highlights the critical importance of prevention. Viral transmission may be interrupted by contact isolation with droplet precautions for infected patients and by having patients and health care workers with suspected infection, and their relatives, refrain from visits and work. Immunisation remains the cornerstone of influenza prevention and is recommended for patients with haematological malignancies, their relatives, and health care workers.","publish_time":"2010-08-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schnell, David; Legoff, J\u00E9r\u00F4me; Azoulay, \u00C9lie","journal":"Pulmonary Involvement in Patients with Hematological Malignancies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4664104ec2ed95ee482c55c331d52b5fdf14e8a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115022.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immunocompromised patients","Common respiratory viruses","infected patients","haematological malignancies","RSV","pneumonia rates","viral transmission","Parainfluenza viruses","optimal management of common viral pneumonia","viral activity","severe infections","adenovirus infections","mortality rates","respiratory syncytial virus","cornerstone of influenza prevention","relatives","fungal co-infections","health care workers","exact mechanisms of pneumonia","immunocompetent hosts","immunocompromised hosts","Prolonged high-titre viral shedding","true opportunistic respiratory pathogens","higher rates of progression","virus reservoir","immunocompetent individuals","critical importance of prevention","haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients","late airflow obstruction","contact isolation","suspected infection","drugs","droplet precautions","absence of proven effective treatments","refrain","cidofovir","randomised controlled trials","visits","Immunisation","ribavirin","PIV","selection of resistant strains","Neuraminidase inhibitor therapy","evidence","epidemiology"],"language":"en"},

Active compounds (such as substrate analogues, natural products and inhibitors of related proteins) are often identified in low throughput validation studies on a biochemical target. Sometimes the additional structural information is also available from crystallographic studies on protein and ligand complexes. In addition, the structural or sequence similarity of various protein targets yields a novel possibility for drug discovery. Co-crystallized compounds from homologous proteins can be used to design leads for a new target without co-crystallized ligands. In this paper we evaluate how far such an approach can be used in a real drug campaign, with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus providing an example. Our method is able to construct small molecules as plausible inhibitors solely on the basis of the set of ligands from crystallized complexes of a protein target, and other proteins from its structurally homologous family. The accuracy and sensitivity of the method are estimated here by the subsequent use of an electronic high throughput screening flexible docking algorithm. The best performing ligands are then used for a very restrictive similarity search for potential inhibitors of the SARS protease within the million compounds from the Ligand.Info small molecule meta-database. The selected molecules can be passed on for further experimental validation.","publish_time":"2007-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Plewczynski, Dariusz; Hoffmann, Marcin; von Grotthuss, Marcin; Knizewski, Lukasz; Rychewski, Leszek; Eitner, Krystian; Ginalski, Krzysztof","journal":"J Phys Condens Matter","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1bc2aa9c31bc512827c650d18968a96e6d847c7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115750.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115750/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs2MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Co-crystallized compounds","co-crystallized ligands","crystallized complexes","small molecules","Active compounds","homologous proteins","active molecules","inhibitors of related proteins","potential inhibitors","plausible inhibitors","low throughput validation studies","ligand complexes","biochemical target","new target","set of ligands","method","selected molecules","additional structural information","best performing ligands","sequence similarity of various protein targets","electronic high throughput screening flexible docking algorithm","crystallographic studies","SARS protease","drug discovery","homologous family","experimental validation","real drug campaign","restrictive similarity search","Info small molecule meta-database","severe acute respiratory syndrome","novel possibility","natural products","substrate analogues","coronavirus","subsequent use","basis","beginning","leads","accuracy","sensitivity","example","cases","approach","paper"],"language":"en"},

Mortality risk is high in newborns with Plasmodium falciparum born to nonimmune women, who typically present at birth or soon thereafter. Semi-immune women are less likely to transmit malaria, and their children often become ill weeks after delivery with less severe symptoms. Cases in the USA usually trace to semi-immune immigrant mothers whose last exposure to malaria may have preceded the pregnancy, leading to misdiagnoses. Congenital malaria may be under-recognized in malaria-endemic areas since parasitemia occurring after the first week of life is usually attributed to mosquito transmission. Malaria prophylaxis and the absence of fever during pregnancy do not preclude congenital malaria in a newborn. Quinine plus clindamycin is commonly used to treat P. falciparum congenital malaria, and chloroquine is used to treat other malaria parasites, such as Plasmodium vivax. Severe cases should be managed with intravenous quinine (available as its enantiomer quinidine in the USA) or with intravenous artesunate, which was recently approved for investigational use by the US FDA.

In China, the government is the main provider of health and social services, and the role of NGOs is more limited than in other countries. Despite this, China has opened the door for NGO participation in its AIDS response, initially because of donor pressure but increasingly due to official acknowledgment of the important role these groups play in controlling the epidemic. Since the first AIDS NGOs were established in China in the 1990s, Chinese AIDS NGOs have made unique contributions to China\u2019s AIDS response in critical areas like access to drugs, support for treatment compliance, outreach to marginalized at-risk groups, and efforts to reduce stigma among marginalized populations. However, there has been a substantial drop-off in donor funding in recent years, and although the Chinese government has filled the funding gap, demonstrating its commitment to the sector, recent policy moves toward greater control over the work and funding of NGOs threatens their survival. Thus far, China\u2019s AIDS response has been noteworthy, but these new NGO funding and regulatory developments pose significant challenges to the next phase of outreach, prevention, treatment, and care.","publish_time":"2019-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kaufman, Joan","journal":"HIV/AIDS in China","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e09e904ff206052537e487864dfb605e2f3d3fe7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7119907.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119907/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["funding of NGOs","Chinese AIDS NGOs","China\u2019s AIDS response","role of NGOs","donor funding","funding gap","new NGO funding","NGO participation","Chinese government","recent years","recent policy","treatment compliance","at-risk groups","phase of outreach","donor pressure","important role","marginalized populations","active participation of nongovernmental organizations","unique contributions","access","critical areas","drugs","support","significant challenges","regulatory developments","social services","greater control","main provider of health","efforts","official acknowledgment","commitment","substantial drop-off","sector","stigma","prevention","work","door","civil society","care","survival","countries","epidemic"],"language":"en"},

Since nasal sprays are moving towards being preservative-free, the chapter covers specialized methods of achieving a sterile product, namely, formulation strategies, manufacturing strategies, and the device landscape that support this upcoming platform. Finally, the chapter reviews various pathways for regulatory approval around the world, for brand and generic, with particular emphasis on the growing acceptance of in vitro data for locally acting nasal spray products.","publish_time":"2013-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ehrick, Jason D.; Shah, Samir A.; Shaw, Charles; Kulkarni, Vitthal S.; Coowanitwong, Intira; De, Samiran; Suman, Julie D.","journal":"Sterile Product Development","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c0bac534cce56b925e8d1d2e8a4adb39e973398.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120012.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120012/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["nasal cavity","nasal sprays","acting nasal spray products","nasal dosage forms","context of existing nasal spray products","chapter reviews various pathways","targets","regulatory approval","regulatory requirements","manufacturing strategies","formulation strategies","unique advantages","analytical testing","data","particular emphasis","brand","device landscape","sterile product","world","specialized methods","central nervous system drug delivery","growing acceptance of","physiology","preservative-free","upcoming platform","anatomy","challenges"],"language":"en"},

The invasion phenomena of epidemics have been of tremendous interest among the scientific community over many years, due to its large scale implementation in real world networks. This chapter seeks to make readers understand the critical issues involved in epidemics such as propagation, spread and their combat which can be further used to design synthetic and robust network architectures. The primary concern in this chapter focuses on the concept of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) models with their implementation in scale-free networks, followed by developing strategies for identifying the damage caused in the network. The relevance of this chapter can be understood when methods discussed in this chapter could be related to contemporary networks for improving their performance in terms of robustness. The patterns by which epidemics spread through groups are determined by the properties of the pathogen carrying it, length of its infectious period, its severity as well as by network structures within the population. Thus, accurately modeling the underlying network is crucial to understand the spread as well as prevention of an epidemic. Moreover, implementing immunization strategies helps control and terminate theses epidemics.","publish_time":"2015-03-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tagore, Somnath","journal":"Propagation Phenomena in Real World Networks","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fb98c5c16679238fd2084653cf16b1056f88b048.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120102.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120102/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs5MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["chapter","network structures","scale-free networks","Susceptible-Infectious","underlying network","spread","concept of Susceptible","contemporary networks","theses epidemics","robust network architectures","large scale implementation","case of scale","real world networks","infectious period","invasion phenomena of epidemics","concept of epidemic outbursts","immunization strategies","SIS","models","years","performance","severity","SIR","critical issues","scientific community","length","groups","propagation","synthetic","readers","terms of robustness","pathogen","properties","patterns","primary concern","prevention","damage","population","methods","combat","mission","relevance"],"language":"en"},

Two free boundaries are introduced to describe the spreading frontiers of the avian influenza. The basic reproduction numbers r (0)(F) (t) and R (0)(F)(t) are defined for the bird with the avian influenza and for the human with the mutant avian influenza of the free boundary problem, respectively. Properties of these two time-dependent basic reproduction numbers are obtained. Sufficient conditions both for spreading and for vanishing of the avian influenza are given. It is shown that if r (0)(F) (0) \u003C 1 and the initial number of the infected birds is small, the avian influenza vanishes in the bird world.

Each truncated S protein was fixed on to the well of an ELISA plate and an interaction was initiated with the ACE2 protein. The adsorption were quantified by ELISA, and the results indicated that amino acids from 388 to 496 of the S protein was responsible for the interaction with the ACE2 receptor, and the interaction could be completely disrupted by an antibody specific to these amino acids.

This policy clearly shows that the Chinese government has once again taken full responsibility to solve public health problems and has profound impact far beyond the AIDS field. In early 2006, the central government put scientific and technology innovation as a national priority and set the target to build an innovative China by year 2020. Since then, the government has been increasing investment in science and technology with major emphasis on both infectious diseases control and new drug research and development. For the first time, development of 100 new drugs and control of major infectious diseases (AIDS, HBV, TB and other emerging infectious diseases) have been selected as national key scientific projects.

The reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial including improved survival of preterm infants. AIM: To assess the severity of viral bronchiolitis in preterm compared to term infants admitted at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt, based on the outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted throughout a 3-year period from September 2011 to October 2014. It included 153 infants, 74 healthy preterm, and 79 healthy term infants admitted with clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Bronchiolitis severity score (BSS) was recorded, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from each patient at the time of presentation. Viruses were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The clinical course and patient\u2019s outcome were recorded. RESULTS: This study recorded a significantly more severe BSS for preterm compared to term infants. The preterm group had an increased mean length of hospital stay and oxygen therapy and was more likely to need intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation (MV) compared to the term group. The mean (\u00B1 SD) BSS for infections with h-MPV, RSV, and para-influenza 3 was more significantly severe in preterm compared to term infants. Bacterial co-infection was significantly correlated with severity scoring in both groups. CONCLUSION: Prematurity significantly affects the severity of bronchiolitis, and this underscores the importance of early categorization as a high-risk group on their first visit. The physician should be aware that their illness runs a more severe course, even if they have no underlying disorders.","publish_time":"2019-03-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Basha, Noussa R.; Marzouk, Huda; Sherif, May M.; El Kholy, Amani A.","journal":"J Egypt Public Health Assoc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89b693e87a5043272d0aa0211a473ecf0f141a03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7091660.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7091660/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEzLmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":780156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:30Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"m1t8BUPWtIoahYK8Zr775Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_13.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of bronchiolitis","preterm group","healthy term infants","improved survival of preterm infants","severity of viral bronchiolitis","Bronchiolitis severity score","tertiary hospital","severe BSS","clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis","severe course","increased mean length of hospital","high-risk group","clinical course","Egypt","Cairo","prospective study","patient\u2019s outcome","intensive care unit admission","reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","mechanical ventilation","MV","RSV","RT-PCR","h-MPV","infections","oxygen therapy","importance of early categorization","illness","SD","rate of admissions","Viruses","para-influenza","PATIENTS","METHODS","Prematurity","Bacterial co-infection","nasopharyngeal swabs","time of presentation","physician","BACKGROUND","visit","CONCLUSION","past years","year period","underlying disorders","RESULTS","reasons","AIM","groups"],"language":"en"},

We describe the epidemiology of respiratory viruses and infection prevention and control interventions aimed to reduce acquisition and transmission of respiratory viruses in our NICU. METHODS: From May 2012 to December 2016, we tracked respiratory viruses detected by a multiplex reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR assay (FilmArray, Biofire, Inc.) in our 58-bed level IV NICU (~1,000 annual admissions). Testing was ordered by treating clinicians for symptomatic infants. Infants with positive RT-PCR tests generally remained on contact/ droplet precautions throughout their NICU stay. HCP were instructed not to work sick and report to Workforce Health and Safety if they became ill at work. Ill visitors were not permitted in the NICU, as enforced by written educational materials and signage, but formal screening was not performed. Starting in January 2015, asymptomatic infants exposed to RT-PCR-positive index cases were screened by RT-PCR, put on contact/ droplet precautions for the incubation period (IP) of the index case\u2019s virus, and screened again at IP end. Starting in December 2015, visitors \u003C12 years old were banned year-round. We assessed dyad transmission events (2 infants), clusters (3 infants), and outbreaks (\u003E3 infants); all were defined as detecting geographically related cases within the relevant IP. We determined screened infants who had positive RT-PCR tests. RESULTS: During the 56 month observation period, 79 infants had 83 viruses detected (~1.8% of admissions). Rhino/ enterovirus (RV/EV) were most common (n = 59) and caused 1 outbreak of 7 infants, 4 clusters, and 5 dyad transmissions. Adenovirus caused 1 outbreak of 5 infants. Two dyad transmissions occurred for parainfluenza. Sporadic cases of RSV (n = 5), coronavirus (n = 5), and influenza (n = 2) occurred. Ill household contacts were identified for 10 infants. No HCPs were identified with respiratory illnesses. Since January 2015, 8 screened infants had positive RT-PCR tests. Since December 2015, only 1 transmission dyad (RV/EV) occurred. CONCLUSION: Preliminary data suggest that our interventions have reduced the burden of respiratory viruses in the NICU.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of GCV-R CMV infection in a high-risk population. METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective cohort study of lung transplant recipients with genotype confirmed GCV-R CMV and ganciclovir-sensitive (GCV-S) CMV infection, matched (1:3) by year of diagnosis. Clinical outcomes within 1 year following the onset of CMV infection and total hospital costs were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were included in the analysis: 7 with GCV-R CMV infection and 21 with GCV-S CMV infection. Baseline demographics (Table 1) were similar in the two groups. CMV load at diagnosis was numerically higher (282,932 I.U./mL [IQR, 43,181 IU/mL 3,368,931 I.U./mL] vs. 44,604 IU/mL [IQR, 6,314 I.U./mL 88,797 IU/mL], P = 0.10) and days to CMV infection following discontinuation of antiviral prophylaxis was numerically lower (20 [IQR, 0\u2013137] vs. 175 [IQR, 123\u2013190], P = 0.07) in the GCV-R CMV group. All-cause mortality (71.4% vs. 19.0%, P = 0.02) and total hospital days due to CMV infection (63 [IQR, 34\u201376] vs. 6 [IQR, 2\u20139], P \u003C 0.01) were significantly higher in the GCV-R CMV cohort.

In contrast BKVN is rarely been reported in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Renal dysfunction after HCT is common and often attributed to total body irradiation, drug toxicity, hypertension or microangiopathy. As kidney biopsies are rarely performed after HCT, BKVN may be underdiagnosed. We report a Single-center experience of BKVN in HCT recipients. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of HCT recipients from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2017. Only cases of BKVN confirmed by immunohistochemical stain on renal biopsy are included. Urine and blood BKV PCR was performed at Viracor Eurofins (Lee\u2019s Summit, MO). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2017, 320 patients received HCT and 6 patients underwent kidney biopsy and 4 had BKVN. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Three patients (75%) received ex vivo T-cell depleted (CD34\u002B selected) peripheral blood (PB) HCT and did not receive pharmacologic GVHD prophylaxis; one patient received cord blood allograft. All patients had BKV viruria with a median BKV viral load of 9.3 log(10) copies/mL (range, 8.6\u201310.0) and median onset 18 days (range 6\u201341) post HCT. BKVN was diagnosed at a median of 275.5 days post-HCT (range, 141\u2013637). All patients presented with decreased GFR (median 47.5% reduction, range 16\u201375%) from GFR at transplant. One patient had proteinuria (3 g over 24 hours); one patient had hydronephrosis. At BKVN diagnosis plasma BKV viral load was a median of 6.2 log(10) copies/mL; range, 6.0\u20136.3), absolute lymphocyte count median 1027 (range 335\u20132,536) and CD4\u002B lymphocyte count median 145 (range 64\u2013172). CONCLUSION: (1) BKVN should be considered in HCT recipients with worsening renal function and high BKV viremia. (2) Early, noninvasive predictors of BKVN could aid in identifying high-risk patients for early intervention prior to irreversible loss of kidney function. (3) Reduction of immunosuppression is often not feasible in HCT. The role of preemptive antiviral therapy and/or adoptive cell therapy for BKV viremia in HCT should be evaluated in clinical trials.

The use of respiratory filters has not decreased the incidence of VAP in patients on anesthesia machines and in critically ill patients. Besides, respiratory filters could have some undesirable effects such as the increase of resistance to inspiratory airflow, increase of resistance to expiratory airflow and increase of dead space in the breathing circuit. Thus, the use of respiratory filters is not routinely necessary; however, they should be used in patients with suspected or confirmed highly communicable respiratory infections (such as bacillary pulmonary tuberculosis) and who require mechanical ventilation).","publish_time":"2011-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lorente, Leonardo","journal":"Humidification in the Intensive Care Unit","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b822052e7d4d1c9014b0603eefc8306d17262b5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124111.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjs3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["use of respiratory filters","respiratory circuits","communicable respiratory infections","outbreaks of respiratory infections","increase of resistance","ill patients","reports","contamination of anesthesia machines","expiratory airflow","inspiratory airflow","incidence of VAP","dead space","bacillary pulmonary tuberculosis","high capacity","ventilator-associated pneumonia","undesirable effects","cause","devices","breathing circuit","bacteriological demonstration","mechanical ventilation","passage of microorganisms","effect relationship"],"language":"en"},

{"cord_uid":"784bpdxr","sha":null,"source_x":"PMC","title":"Can homemade fit testing solutions be as effective as commercial products?","doi":"10.1071/hi12019","pmcid":"PMC7129124","pubmed_id":null,"license":"no-cc","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Fit testing is used to determine whether a N95 mask will provide respiratory protection for the wearer by preventing inhalation of airborne transmitted microorganisms. National guidelines recommend that healthcare workers (HCW) who use N95 masks require fit testing. Quantitative fit testing requires the purchasing and use of fit testing solutions and associated equipment. In high volume, these solutions are expensive and may not be readily available, as was seen in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine how a homemade solution compared against a commercially available product and a placebo. METHODS: Afit test was performed on the same person, on three separate occasions, using three different solutions \u2013 commercial (45% sodium saccharin), homemade (to be disclosed) and placebo (water). The solution was double blinded and solutions were chosen and administered in a random order. RESULTS: Atotal of 48 people participated in this study.At the threshold testing stage, 8.3% did not taste any solution, 16.7% of people could taste the placebo, 89.6% could taste the commercial solution and 91.7% could taste the homemade solution. All persons who could taste the commercial solution could taste homemade solution. CONCLUSION: The findings of our study suggest that fit testing solutions could be made locally with a similar effect to that of commercial products, that quantitative fit testing is unreliable and that serious consideration should be given to the role of quantitative fit testing in future guidelines and standards. We recommend that this study be conducted on a larger scale to support our findings.","publish_time":"2016-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitchell, Brett G.; Wells, Anne; McGregor, Alistair; McKenzie, Duncan","journal":"Healthc Infect","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129124/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE2LmNzdjszMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":439440,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:15Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"pk7jkN5HBFdcL/nym/v9IA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_16.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fit testing solutions","commercial solution","homemade solution","role of quantitative fit testing","study","threshold testing stage","different solutions","placebo","commercial products","findings","people","future guidelines","National guidelines","N95 masks","available product","purchasing","wearer","HCW","respiratory protection","healthcare workers","inhalation of airborne transmitted microorganisms","separate occasions","serious consideration","standards","associated equipment","sodium saccharin","similar effect","high volume","larger scale","Afit test","H1N1 influenza pandemic","METHODS","RESULTS","Atotal","CONCLUSION","persons","BACKGROUND","random order","water","aim"],"language":"en"},

Alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) are the first cells that influenza virus encounters upon entering the alveolus. Infected epithelial cells produce cytokines that attract and activate neutrophils and macrophages, which in turn induce damage to the epithelial-endothelial barrier. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met and transforming growth factor-\u03B1 (TGF-\u03B1)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are well known to regulate repair of damaged alveolar epithelium by stimulating cell migration and proliferation. Recently, TGF-\u03B1/EGFR signaling has also been shown to regulate innate immune responses in bronchial epithelial cells. However, little is known about whether HGF/c-Met signaling alters the innate immune responses and whether the innate immune responses in AECs are regulated by HGF/c-Met and TGF-\u03B1/EGFR. We hypothesized that HGF/c-Met and TGF-\u03B1/EGFR would regulate innate immune responses to influenza A virus infection in human AECs. We found that recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) and rhTGF-\u03B1 stimulated primary human AECs to secrete IL-8 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) strongly and IL-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 moderately. Influenza infection stimulated the secretion of IL-8 and GM-CSF by AECs plated on rat-tail collagen through EGFR activation likely by TGF-\u03B1 released from AECs and through c-Met activated by HGF secreted from lung fibroblasts. HGF secretion by fibroblasts was stimulated by AEC production of prostaglandin E(2) during influenza infection. We conclude that HGF/c-Met and TGF-\u03B1/EGFR signaling enhances the innate immune responses by human AECs during influenza infections.","publish_time":"2015-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ito, Yoko; Correll, Kelly; Zemans, Rachel L.; Leslie, Christina C.; Murphy, Robert C.; Mason, Robert J.","journal":"Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4451400.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4451400/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzUzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["AEC","EGFR","HGF"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["c-Met","innate immune responses","growth factor-\u03B1","HGF secretion","rhTGF-\u03B1","recombinant human HGF","primary human AECs","EGFR activation","influenza infections","Alveolar epithelial cells","influenza virus encounters","bronchial epithelial cells","Infected epithelial cells","Hepatocyte growth factor","severe complication of influenza","secretion of IL","virus infection","epidermal growth factor receptor","GM-CSF","epithelial-endothelial barrier","lung fibroblasts","repair of damaged alveolar epithelium","rat-tail collagen","cell migration","rhHGF","granulocyte macrophage colony","AEC production of prostaglandin E","turn","viral pneumonia","cytokines","acute respiratory distress syndrome","neutrophils","macrophages","proliferation","monocyte chemotactic protein","alveolus"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies revealed that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) makes no exception, interacting with the host cell nuclear transport machinery at two different levels. On the one hand, small amounts of both core and NS5A localize within the host cell nucleus during productive infection, modulating gene expression and signaling functions to promote persistent infection. On the other hand, HCV infection causes a profound redistribution of certain nucleoproteins to the close proximity of endoplasmic reticulum membrane-derived viral replication factories, where viral RNA amplification occurs. These nucleoporins are believed to form nuclear pore complex-like structures, as suggested by their ability to recruit nuclear localization sequence-bearing proteins. Thus, both processes are linked to virus-induced persistence and pathogenesis, representing possible targets for the development of novel anti-HCV therapeutics.","publish_time":"2015-06-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bonamassa, Barbara; Ciccarese, Francesco; Antonio, Veronica Di; Contarini, Andrea; Pal\u00F9, Giorgio; Alvisi, Gualtiero","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/802ec789744669d95c380885412457a648a10e0d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4472997.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4472997/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU1OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV infection","host cell nuclear transport machinery","host cell nucleus","nuclear transport functionality","productive infection","nuclear localization sequence","nuclear pore complex","persistent infection","hand","host immune response","nucleocytoplasmic transport apparatus","genes expression","development of novel anti-HCV therapeutics","viral RNA amplification","modulating gene expression","virus-induced persistence","hepatitis C virus","close proximity of endoplasmic reticulum membrane-derived viral replication factories","possible targets","components","profound redistribution of certain nucleoproteins","NS5A","pathogenesis","core","functions","cytoplasmic replicating viruses","different levels","factors","small amounts","structures","ability","exception","Recent studies","evidence","processes","nucleoporins"],"language":"en"},

However, this involvement has not been well-studied in the paradigm of macrophage polarization, which typically has been categorized by the dichotomy of classical (M1) and alternative (M2) statuses. Recent studies have revealed the complexity of macrophage polarization in response to various cellular mediators and exogenous stimuli by adopting a multipolar view to revisit the differential process of macrophages, especially those re-polarized during viral infections. Here, through examination of viral infections targeting macrophages/monocytic cells, we focus on the direct involvement of macrophage polarization during viral infections. Type I and type III interferons (IFNs) are critical in regulation of viral pathogenesis and host antiviral infection; thus, we propose to incorporate IFN-mediated antiviral states into the framework of macrophage polarization. This view is supported by the multifunctional properties of type I IFNs, which potentially elicit and regulate both M1- and M2-polarization in addition to inducing the antiviral state, and by the discoveries of viral mechanisms to adapt and modulate macrophage polarization. Indeed, several recent studies have demonstrated effective prevention of viral diseases through manipulation of macrophage immune statuses.","publish_time":"2015-03-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sang, Yongming; Miller, Laura C; Blecha, Frank","journal":"J Clin Cell Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fd4b79d3d28a8c01c635987b474443590c240f4c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4512304.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4512304/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzU4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["III"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Macrophage involvement","complexity of macrophage polarization","paradigm of macrophage polarization","framework of macrophage polarization","direct involvement of macrophage polarization","examination of viral infections","M2-polarization","regulation of viral pathogenesis","discoveries of viral mechanisms","antiviral states","manipulation of macrophage immune statuses","effective prevention of viral diseases","host antiviral infection","IFNs","M1","Recent studies","multifunctional properties of type","multipolar view","differential process of macrophages","response","various cellular mediators","exogenous stimuli","monocytic cells","alternative","addition","interferons","dichotomy of classical"],"language":"en"},

However, in 2014, a sharp rise was observed in the number of cases of JE in north-eastern Assam state, and 51% of the total cases of JE in India were reported from the Assam in the same year. In this regard, a study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare workers in Darrang, a district of Assam highly affected by JE. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted for 2 months among HCWs in the major district hospital of Darrang, Assam. A pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants. Convenience sampling approach was used to collect data from different departments of the hospitals. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were used to express the results. RESULTS: The knowledge of HCWs regarding JE was poor with a mean knowledge score of 11.02\u00B12.39 (out of 17), while their attitudes were positive with a mean attitudes score of 43.16\u00B1 2.47 (ranging from 13 to 52). Overall, 40.4% and 74.3% of participants demonstrated good knowledge and positive attitudes respectively. Cut-off score for good knowledge and positive attitudes toward JE was set as \u226512 and \u003E40 respectively. Older participants (40\u201349 years) and experienced workers (\u003E10 years) were significantly associated with good knowledge as compared to their referent group (p\u003C0.05), while knowledge of nurses and other orderlies were significantly lower than physicians (p\u003C0.01). Similar factors were associated with the positive attitudes of the participants with the exception of experience. Television was the major source of information regarding JE reported by HCWs (79%). CONCLUSION: Although the knowledge was not optimized, HCWs exhibited positive attitudes towards JE. Future research is required to design, implement and evaluate interventions to improve the knowledge of JE among HCWs.","publish_time":"2015-08-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ahmad, Akram; Khan, Muhammad Umair; Gogoi, Lakhya Jyoti; Kalita, Manabendra; Sikdar, Atul Prasad; Pandey, Sureshwar; Dhingra, Sameer","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fad38d4f310922f5af4326b319cfaf1eb8f70282.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4546657.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4546657/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYxNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["JE"],"locations":["India","Assam"],"keyphrases":["knowledge of JE","knowledge of HCWs","good knowledge","positive attitudes","knowledge of nurses","mean knowledge score","mean attitudes","total cases of JE","attitudes of healthcare workers","district of Assam","Older participants","major district hospital of Darrang","data","north-eastern Assam state","years","India","Cut-off score","results","major source of information","major cause of high morbidity","number of cases","experienced workers","cross sectional study","mortality","months","self-administered questionnaire","states","orderlies","Japanese encephalitis","logistic regression analyses","referent group","different departments","hospitals","METHODS","physicians","Television","INTRODUCTION","Convenience sampling approach","exception of experience","Similar factors","sharp rise","interventions","Future research","regard","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

We describe factors associated with pneumonia among adults hospitalized with influenza. METHODS: Through the Emerging Infections Program, we identified adults \u2265 18 years, who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza during October 2005 through April 2008, and had a chest radiograph (CXR) performed. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of a CXR infiltrate and either an ICD-9-CM code or discharge summary diagnosis of pneumonia. RESULTS: Among 4,765 adults hospitalized with influenza, 1392 (29 %) had pneumonia. In multivariable analysis, factors associated with pneumonia included: age \u2265 75 years, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.27 (95 % confidence interval 1.10\u20131.46), white race AOR 1.24 (1.03\u20131.49), nursing home residence AOR 1.37 (1.14\u20131.66), chronic lung disease AOR 1.37 (1.18\u20131.59), immunosuppression AOR 1.45 (1.19\u20131.78), and asthma AOR 0.76 (0.62\u20130.92). Patients with pneumonia were significantly more likely to require intensive care unit (ICU) admission (27 % vs. 10 %), mechanical ventilation (18 % vs. 5 %), and to die (9 % vs. 2 %). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia was present in nearly one-third of adults hospitalized with influenza and was associated with ICU admission and death. Among patients hospitalized with influenza, older patients and those with certain underlying conditions are more likely to have pneumonia. Pneumonia is common among adults hospitalized with influenza and should be evaluated and treated promptly.

Recently, a small overlapping coding sequence, termed pipo, was found to be conserved in the genomes of all potyvirids. PIPO is expressed as part of a frameshift protein, P3N-PIPO, which is essential for virus cell-to-cell movement. However, the frameshift expression mechanism has hitherto remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that transcriptional slippage, specific to the viral RNA polymerase, results in a population of transcripts with an additional \u201CA\u201D inserted within a highly conserved GAAAAAA sequence, thus enabling expression of P3N-PIPO. The slippage efficiency is \u223C2% in Turnip mosaic virus and slippage is inhibited by mutations in the GAAAAAA sequence.

Photolyases (PHR) are evolutionarily ancient enzymes. They are activated by light and repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. Although cryptochromes share structural similarity with DNA photolyases, they lack DNA repair activity. Cryptochrome (CRY) is one of the key elements of the circadian system in animals. In plants, CRY acts as a blue light receptor to entrain circadian rhythms, and mediates a variety of light responses, such as the regulation of flowering and seedling growth. RESULTS: We performed a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the CRY/PHR superfamily. The superfamily consists of 7 major subfamilies: CPD class I and CPD class II photolyases, (6\u20134) photolyases, CRY-DASH, plant PHR2, plant CRY and animal CRY. Although the whole superfamily evolved primarily under strong purifying selection (average \u03C9 = 0.0168), some subfamilies did experience strong episodic positive selection during their evolution. Photolyases were lost in higher animals that suggests natural selection apparently became weaker in the late stage of evolutionary history. The evolutionary time estimates suggested that plant and animal CRYs evolved in the Neoproterozoic Era (~1000\u2013541 Mya), which might be a result of adaptation to the major climate and global light regime changes occurred in that period of the Earth\u2019s geological history.","publish_time":"2015-09-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mei, Qiming; Dvornyk, Volodymyr","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c6b707c8cbd087e87e1a1c1f2e809cffc96a9dc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4564169.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4564169/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzYzMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA photolyases","PHR superfamily","major subfamilies","CPD class","repair DNA damage","blue light receptor","plant PHR2","DNA repair activity","variety of light responses","cryptochromes","global light regime changes","late stage of evolutionary history","strong purifying selection","evolutionary time estimates","comprehensive evolutionary analysis","major climate","strong episodic positive selection","circadian rhythms","animal CRYs","circadian system","higher animals","Earth\u2019s geological history","period","average \u03C9","related flavoproteins","regulation of flowering","acts","UV radiation","structural similarity","DASH","Neoproterozoic Era","result of adaptation","key elements","seedling growth","distinct physiological functions","ancient enzymes","plants","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","Mya"],"language":"en"},

A missing piece of the puzzle is the current distribution and the genetic variation of PUUV in France, which has been overlooked until now and remains poorly understood. During a population survey, from 2008 to 2011, bank voles were trapped in eight different forests of France located in areas known to be endemic for NE or in area from where no NE case has been reported until now. Bank voles were tested for immunoglobulin (Ig)G ELISA serology and two seropositive animals for each of three different areas (Ardennes, Jura and Orleans) were then subjected to laboratory analyses in order to sequence the whole S, M and L segments of PUUV. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that French PUUV isolates globally belong to the central European (CE) lineage although isolates from Ardennes are clearly distinct from those in Jura and Orleans, suggesting a different evolutionary history and origin of PUUV introduction in France. Sequence analyses revealed specific amino acid signatures along the N protein, including in PUUV from the Orleans region from where NE in humans has never been reported.

Twenty-seven variants of the new Lombrosian vision of forensic screening and prevention are distinguished, and some scientific and technical limitations are noted. Some lures, biases and structural factors, making the application of the Lombrosian idea likely in spite of weak evidence are pointed out and noted as a specific type of ethical aspect. Many classic and complex ethical challenges for health screening programmes are shown to apply to the identified variants and the choice between them, albeit with peculiar and often provoking variations.

The pathogenesis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) remains incompletely understood, with no clinically effective treatment for potentially severe complications such as photoreceptor cell death and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Here we investigate the protein profile of the vitreous following experimental retinal detachment using a comparative proteomic based approach. Materials and Methods. Retinal detachment was created in the right eyes of six New Zealand red pigmented rabbits. Sham surgery was undertaken in five other rabbits that were used as controls. After seven days the eyes were enucleated and the vitreous was removed. The vitreous samples were evaluated with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the differentially expressed proteins were identified with tandem mass spectrometry. Results. Ten protein spots were found to be at least twofold differentially expressed when comparing the vitreous samples of the sham and retinal detachment surgery groups. Protein spots that were upregulated in the vitreous following retinal detachment were identified as albumin fragments, and those downregulated were found to be peroxiredoxin 2, collagen-I\u03B11 fragment, and \u03B1-1-antiproteinase F.

However, it remains unknown whether this association represents an independent risk for poor outcome. We aimed to estimate the attributable effect of CMV reactivation on mortality in immunocompetent ARDS patients. METHODS: We prospectively studied immunocompetent ARDS patients who tested seropositive for CMV and remained mechanically ventilated beyond day 4 in two tertiary intensive care units in the Netherlands from 2011 to 2013. CMV loads were determined in plasma weekly. Competing risks Cox regression was used with CMV reactivation status as a time-dependent exposure variable. Subsequently, in sensitivity analyses we adjusted for the evolution of disease severity until onset of reactivation using marginal structural modeling. RESULTS: Of 399 ARDS patients, 271 (68 %) were CMV seropositive and reactivation occurred in 74 (27 %) of them. After adjustment for confounding and competing risks, CMV reactivation was associated with overall increased ICU mortality (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) 2.74, 95 % CI 1.51\u20134.97), which resulted from the joint action of trends toward an increased mortality rate (direct effect; cause specific hazard ratio (HR) 1.58, 95 % CI 0.86\u20132.90) and a reduced successful weaning rate (indirect effect; cause specific HR 0.83, 95 % CI 0.58\u20131.18). These associations remained in sensitivity analyses. The population-attributable fraction of ICU mortality was 23 % (95 % CI 6\u201341) by day 30 (risk difference 4.4, 95 % CI 1.1\u20137.9). CONCLUSION: CMV reactivation is independently associated with increased case fatality in immunocompetent ARDS patients who are CMV seropositive.

However, due to the antigenic differences among the five ebolavirus species, the current therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are only effective against viruses of the species Zaire ebolavirus. Although this particular species has indeed caused the majority of human infections in Central and, recently, West Africa, other ebolavirus species (e.g., Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo ebolavirus) have also repeatedly caused outbreaks in Central Africa and thus should not be neglected in the development of countermeasures against ebolaviruses. Here we report the generation of an ebolavirus glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody that effectively inhibits cellular entry of representative isolates of all known ebolavirus species in vitro and show its protective efficacy in mouse models of ebolavirus infections. This novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody targets a highly conserved internal fusion loop in the glycoprotein molecule and prevents membrane fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The discovery of this highly cross-neutralizing antibody provides a promising option for broad-acting ebolavirus antibody therapy and will accelerate the design of improved vaccines that can selectively elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies against multiple species of ebolaviruses.","publish_time":"2016-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Furuyama, Wakako; Marzi, Andrea; Nanbo, Asuka; Haddock, Elaine; Maruyama, Junki; Miyamoto, Hiroko; Igarashi, Manabu; Yoshida, Reiko; Noyori, Osamu; Feldmann, Heinz; Takada, Ayato","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/02fdaf97dd0af539eada2af2f1563e0d77a28f92.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4748290.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4748290/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzgxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["West Africa","Central Africa"],"keyphrases":["known ebolavirus species","species Zaire ebolavirus","Sudan ebolavirus","Bundibugyo ebolavirus","ebolavirus glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody","monoclonal antibody therapy","broad-acting ebolavirus antibody therapy","particular species","mouse models of ebolavirus infections","novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody","multiple species of ebolaviruses","West Africa","Central Africa","current therapeutic monoclonal antibodies","glycoprotein molecule","membrane fusion","cellular membranes","majority of human infections","conserved internal fusion loop","cellular entry of representative isolates","latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease","promising option","protective efficacy","viral envelope","ZMapp","design of improved vaccines","generation","antigenic differences","outbreaks","development of countermeasures","patients","discovery"],"language":"en"},

Hantaviruses related human cases have been observed throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America. To date, 23 distinct species of hantaviruses, hosted by reservoir, have been identified. However, the diversity and number of hantaviruses are likely underestimated in China, and hantavirus species that cause disease in many regions, including Yunnan province, are unknown. RESULTS: In August 2012, we collected tissue samples from 189 captured animals, including 15 species belonging to 10 genera, 5 families, and 4 orders in Fugong county, Yunnan province, China. Seven species were positive for hantavirus: Eothenomys eleusis (42/94), Apodemus peninsulae (3/25), Niviventer eha (3/27), Cryptotis montivaga (2/8), Anourosorex squamipes (1/1), Sorex araneus (1/1), and Mustela sibirica (1/2). We characterized one full-length genomic sequence of the virus (named fugong virus, FUGV) from a small oriental vole (Eothenomys eleusis). The full-length sequences of the small, medium, and large segments of FUGV were 1813, 3630, and 6531 nt, respectively. FUGV was most closely related to hantavirus LX309, a previously reported species detected in the red-backed vole in Luxi county, Yunnan province, China. However, the amino acid sequences of nucleocapsid (N), glycoprotein (G), and large protein (L) were highly divergent from those of Hantavirus LX309, with amino acid differences of 11.2, 15.3, and 12.7 %, respectively. In phylogenetic trees, FUGV clustered in the lineage corresponding to hantaviruses carried by rodents in the subfamily Arvicolinae. CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of hantavirus infection in small mammals was found in Fugong county, Yunnan province, China. A novel hantavirus species FUGV was identified from the small oriental vole. This virus is phylogenetic clustering with another hantavirus LX309, but shows highly genomic divergence.","publish_time":"2016-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ge, Xing-Yi; Yang, Wei-Hong; Pan, Hong; Zhou, Ji-Hua; Han, Xi; Zhu, Guang-Jian; Desmond, James S.; Daszak, Peter; Shi, Zheng-Li; Zhang, Yun-Zhi","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7dad7185f2f7dd28cfaa251822682e46bb5b26e6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4754816.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4754816/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzgyOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Mustela"],"organizations":["FUGV"],"locations":["Asia","Europe","Africa","North America","China"],"keyphrases":["hantavirus LX309","novel hantavirus species FUGV","Yunnan province","China","distinct species of hantaviruses","hantavirus pulmonary syndrome","reported species","Fugong county","fugong virus","small oriental vole","number of hantaviruses","High prevalence of hantavirus infection","large segments of FUGV","small mammals","natural reservoirs of hantaviruses","Luxi county","Eothenomys eleusis","Rodents","North America","full-length sequences","amino acid sequences of nucleocapsid","amino acid differences","full-length genomic sequence","renal syndrome","disease types","large protein","phylogenetic clustering","phylogenetic trees","genomic divergence","Eurasia","hemorrhagic fever","orders","Anourosorex squamipes","Cryptotis montivaga","Niviventer eha","glycoprotein","Apodemus peninsulae","Europe","Africa","captured animals","CONCLUSIONS","lineage","regions","Sorex araneus","tissue samples","BACKGROUND","families","human cases","date","subfamily Arvicolinae","diversity","genera","Mustela sibirica","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Traditional smallpox vaccines, essentially vaccinia virus strains, that were used in the eradication of smallpox were administered by percutaneous inoculation (skin scarification). The modified vaccinia virus Ankara is licensed as a smallpox vaccine in Europe and Canada and currently undergoing clinical development in the United States. MVA is also being investigated as a vector for the delivery of heterologous genes for prophylactic or therapeutic immunization. Since MVA is replication-deficient, MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines are often inoculated through the intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Vaccine inoculation via the intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes requires the use of injection needles, and an estimated 10 to 20% of the population of the United States has needle phobia. Following an observation in our laboratory that a replication-deficient recombinant vaccinia virus derived from the New York City Board of Health strain elicited protective immune responses in a mouse model upon inoculation by tail scarification, we investigated whether MVA and MVA recombinants can elicit protective responses following percutaneous administration in mouse models. Our data suggest that MVA administered by percutaneous inoculation, elicited vaccinia-specific antibody responses, and protected mice from lethal vaccinia virus challenge, at levels comparable to or better than subcutaneous or intramuscular inoculation. High titers of specific neutralizing antibodies were elicited in mice inoculated with a recombinant MVA expressing the herpes simplex type 2 glycoprotein D after scarification. Similarly, a recombinant MVA expressing the hemagglutinin of attenuated influenza virus rgA/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1) elicited protective immune responses when administered at low doses by scarification. Taken together, our data suggest that MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines inoculated by scarification can elicit protective immune responses that are comparable to subcutaneous vaccination, and may allow for antigen sparing when vaccine supply is limited.","publish_time":"2016-02-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meseda, Clement A.; Atukorale, Vajini; Kuhn, Jordan; Schmeisser, Falko; Weir, Jerry P.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a94f3fe57da5dad4c965d59faf0facc2039175a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4760941.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4760941/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzgzNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MVA"],"locations":["Ankara","Europe","Canada","United States"],"keyphrases":["recombinant MVA","MVA recombinants","MVA-vectored vaccines","protective responses","protective immune responses","percutaneous inoculation","intramuscular inoculation","vaccinia virus strains","robustness of immune responses","route of vaccine inoculation","elicited vaccinia-specific antibody responses","replication-deficient recombinant vaccinia virus","lethal vaccinia virus challenge","modified vaccinia virus Ankara","subcutaneous routes","tail scarification","skin scarification","subcutaneous vaccination","vaccine supply","Traditional smallpox vaccines","percutaneous administration","eradication of smallpox","United States","antigen","data","hemagglutinin of attenuated influenza virus rgA","protected mice","mouse models","levels comparable","High titers of specific neutralizing antibodies","New York City Board of Health strain","herpes simplex type","Viet Nam","delivery of heterologous genes","glycoprotein D","Canada","H5N1","use of injection needles","clinical development","low doses","therapeutic immunization","Europe","laboratory","needle phobia","population","observation"],"language":"en"},

Recent studies demonstrated that influenza NP is a valid target for antiviral drug development. The surface of the groove, covered with numerous conserved residues between the head and body domains of influenza A NP, plays a crucial role in RNA binding. To explore the mechanism by which NP binds RNA, we performed a series of site-directed mutagenesis in the RNA-binding groove, followed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), to characterize the interactions between RNA and NP. Furthermore, a role of Y148 in NP stability and NP-RNA binding was evaluated. The aromatic residue of Y148 was found to stack with a nucleotide base. By interrupting the stacking interaction between Y148 and an RNA base, we identified an influenza virus NP inhibitor, (E, E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) -1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione; this inhibitor reduced the NP\u2019s RNA-binding affinity and hindered viral replication.

H. parasuis isolates display a wide range of virulence and virulence factors are largely unknown. Commercial bacterins are often used to vaccinate swine against H. parasuis, though strain variability and lack of cross-reactivity can make this an ineffective means of protection. Outer membrane vesicles (OMV) are spherical structures naturally released from the membrane of bacteria and OMV are often enriched in toxins, signaling molecules and other bacterial components. Examination of OMV structures has led to identification of virulence factors in a number of bacteria and they have been successfully used as subunit vaccines. We have isolated OMV from both virulent and avirulent strains of H. parasuis, have examined their protein content and assessed their ability to induce an immune response in the host. Vaccination with purified OMV derived from the virulent H. parasuis Nagasaki strain provided protection against challenge with a lethal dose of the bacteria.","publish_time":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"McCaig, William D.; Loving, Crystal L.; Hughes, Holly R.; Brockmeier, Susan L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6620e8406c8ad908234205ff102d7bd2cc0dce72.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4773134.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4773134/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg0Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OMV"],"locations":["Nagasaki"],"keyphrases":["parasuis isolates","Haemophilus parasuis","purified OMV","isolated OMV","parasuis Nagasaki strain","Examination of OMV structures","membrane of bacteria","identification of virulence factors","number of bacteria","wide range of virulence","strain variability","spherical structures","Outer membrane vesicles","ineffective means of protection","upper respiratory tract of swine","challenge","Gram-negative bacterium","reactivity","lack of cross","avirulent strains of","high morbidity","systemic infection","lethal dose","molecules","immune response","toxins","protein content","bacterial components","host","mortality","Vaccination","Commercial bacterins","subunit vaccines"],"language":"en"},

Due to over-exploitation and habitat loss, the populations of many animals commonly used in TCM have declined and are unable to meet market demand. A number of measures have been taken to try to reduce the impact that this large and growing market for TCM may have on wild animal species. Consumer preferences and behavior are known to play an important role in the consumption and protection of wild animals used in traditional medicine, and thus are likely to be an important factor in the success of many of these mechanisms\u2014particularly given the significant percentage of TCMs that are over-the-counter products (access to which is not mediated by practitioners). In this study we conducted questionnaires and designed stated preference experiments embodying different simulation scenarios using a random sample of the population in Beijing to elicit individuals\u2019 knowledge, perceptions and preferences toward wild or farmed animal materials and their substitutes used in traditional Chinese medicine. We found that respondents had a stated preference for wild materials over farm-raised and other alternatives because they believe that the effectiveness of wild-sourced materials is more credible than that of other sources. However, we also found that, although respondents used TCM products, they had a poor understanding of the function or composition of either traditional Chinese medicines or proprietary Chinese medicines (PCM), and paid little attention to the composition of products when making purchasing decisions. Furthermore, awareness of the need for species protection, or \u201Cconservation consciousness\u201D was found to play an important role in willingness to accept substitutions for wild animal materials, while traditional animal medicinal materials (TAMs) derived from well-known endangered species, such as bear bile and tiger bone, show relatively higher substitutability. These results suggest that there is still hope for conservation measures which seek to promote a transition to farmed animal, plant and synthetic ingredients and provide clear directions for future social marketing, education and engagement efforts.","publish_time":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Zhao; Jiang, Zhigang; Fang, Hongxia; Li, Chunwang; Mi, Aizi; Chen, Jing; Zhang, Xiaowei; Cui, Shaopeng; Chen, Daiqiang; Ping, Xiaoge; Li, Feng; Li, Chunlin; Tang, Songhua; Luo, Zhenhua; Zeng, Yan; Meng, Zhibin","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef39c95cda9c94452dc64147ea7d9c825e03b8bb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4773180.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4773180/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozg0Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Traditional Chinese Medicine","TCM"],"locations":["Beijing"],"keyphrases":["wild materials","wild animal materials","wild animal species","traditional medicines","traditional animal medicinal materials","traditional Chinese medicines","farmed animal materials","protection of wild animals","effectiveness of wild","TCM products","sourced materials","species protection","proprietary Chinese medicines","composition of products","important role","over-the-counter products","well-known endangered species","important factor","respondents","conservation measures","wide array of wildlife species","stated preference experiments","medicinal systems","growing market","Consumer preferences","market demand","conservation consciousness","number of measures","future social marketing","clear directions","different simulation scenarios","TAMs","Beijing","education","random sample","perceptions","PCM","substitutions","substitutes","individuals\u2019 knowledge","synthetic ingredients","plant","function","willingness","consumption","significant percentage of TCMs","engagement efforts","habitat loss","poor understanding","tiger bone","populations","bile","questionnaires","little attention","over-exploitation","higher substitutability","mechanisms","impact","success","access","behavior","purchasing decisions","awareness","need","transition","alternatives","study","sources","practitioners","results"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The colonic expression/activity profile of ACE2, Ang 1\u20137, MAS1-receptor (MAS1-R), MAPK family and Akt were determined by western blot and immunofluorescence. The effect of either exogenous administration of Ang 1\u20137 or pharmacological inhibition of its function (by A779 treatment) was determined using the mouse dextran sulfate sodium model. RESULTS: Enhanced colonic expression of ACE2, Ang1-7 and MAS1-R was observed post-colitis induction. Daily Ang 1\u20137 treatment (0.01\u20130.06 mg/kg) resulted in significant amelioration of DSS-induced colitis. In contrast, daily administration of A779 significantly worsened features of colitis.

Given the precedent for other picornaviruses which use terminal sialic acids (SAs) as receptors, we examined the role of SAs in PSV binding and infection. Using a variety of approaches, including treating cells with a carbohydrate-destroying chemical (NaIO(4)), mono- or oligosaccharides (N-acetylneuraminic acid, galactose, and 6\u2032-sialyllactose), linkage-specific sialidases (neuraminidase and sialidase S), lectins (Maakia amurensis lectin and Sambucus nigra lectin), proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin), and glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors (dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol and phospholipase C), we demonstrated that PSV could recognize \u03B12,3-linked SA on glycolipids as a receptor. On the other hand, PSVs had no binding affinity for synthetic histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), suggesting that PSVs could not use HBGAs as receptors. Depletion of cell surface glycolipids followed by reconstitution studies indicated that GD1a ganglioside, but not other gangliosides, could restore PSV binding and infection, further confirming \u03B12,3-linked SA on GD1a as a PSV receptor.

To find the pH trigger for this reaction we mutated multiple conserved histidines and charged and uncharged hydrophilic residues in the FL and measured their activity by liposome fusion and cell entry of virus-like particles. The FL location in the membrane was assessed by NMR using soluble and lipid-bound paramagnetic relaxation agents.

Ideally, use of ciprofloxacin would be prefaced with AR determination to avoid overuse or misuse of the antibiotic. Here, we describe the development and evaluation of a panel of 44 single-stranded molecular inversion probes (MIPs) coupled to next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the detection of genetic variants known to confer ciprofloxacin resistance in Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis.

However, there were no statistical differences in ISG12-1 and ZC3HAV1 mRNA expression levels in the tumorigenesis phase. ALV-J infection induced a significant increase of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) at 1 d.p.i. and dramatically increased the mRNA levels of melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) in the tumorigenesis phase. Moreover, the protein levels of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) were decreased in chickens with tumors. These results suggest that ALV-J was primarily recognized by chicken TLR7 and MDA5 at early and late in vivo infection stages, respectively. ALV-J strain SCAU-HN06 did not induce any significant antiviral innate immune response in 1 week old chicks. However, interferon-stimulated genes were not induced normally during the late phase of ALV-J infection due to a reduction of IRF1 and STAT1 expression.","publish_time":"2016-05-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Min; Dai, Manman; Xie, Tingting; Li, Zhenhui; Shi, Meiqing; Zhang, Xiquan","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b221945f093d8d13835556a56c2a1d8f02e2705.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4879323.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4879323/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ALV-J infection","late phase of ALV","interferon-\u03B2","ALV-J strain SCAU-HN06","IFN-\u03B2 protein levels","day post infection","ZC3HAV1 mRNA expression levels","infection stages","tumors","regulation of ZC3HAV1 mRNA","anti-inflammatory cytokine IL","tumorigenesis phase","clinical samples","significant antiviral innate immune response","Avian leukosis virus subgroup J","protein levels of interferon regulatory factor","day post hatch","Spleen levels of interleukin","antiviral innate immune responses","mRNA levels of melanoma differentiation-associated gene","days post hatch","MDA5","STAT1 expression","regulation of ISG12","chickens","healthy samples","interferon-stimulated genes","control groups","infected chick groups","significant increase of Toll","week old chicks","chicken TLR7","reduction of IRF1","signal transducer","activator of transcription","receptor","precise mechanism","addition","statistical differences","hemangiomas","immunosuppression","results"],"language":"en"},

CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks.","publish_time":"2016-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"IEEE Trans Med Imaging","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65e1082f09dd9fc02fb06115b8ade1768c5e8fb0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4890616.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4890616/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozk2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNN","ILD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["medical image classification","medical image tasks","fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained","unsupervised CNN pre-training","image recognition","off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features","natural image dataset","hierarchical image features","pre-trained ImageNet","CNNs","CNN model analysis","spatial image context","different CNN architectures","medical imaging tasks","computer-aided detection problems","learning data","transfer learning","mediastinal LN detection","medical imaging domain","specific computer-aided detection","deep convolutional neural networks","supervised fine-tuning","state-of-the-art performance","sufficient training data","ILD categories","availability of large-scale annotated datasets","studied models","design of high performance CAD systems","fold cross-validation classification results","influence of dataset scale","axial CT slices","interstitial lung disease","thoraco-abdominal lymph node","CADe","scratch","understudied factors","extensive empirical evaluation","valuable insights","challenge","Remarkable progress","major techniques","effective method","numbers of layers","parameters","paper"],"language":"en"},

The previous SARS outbreak in this country was accompanied by contradictory information, while worries about wide-spread influenza led to discrimination worldwide. Early understanding of public threat perceptions is therefore important for effective public health communication and intervention. METHODS: We interviewed 1011 respondents by phone two weeks after the first case. Questions examined risk awareness and media use, beliefs about the emergence of the threat and those most at risk, anxiety about infection and preventive and avoidant behaviours. RESULTS: Results demonstrate moderate levels of anxiety but relatively high levels of trust towards government officials. Threat emergence was associated with hygiene levels, temperature change, floating pigs in the Huangpu River and migration to the city. Anxiety predicted both recommended and non-recommended behavioural changes. CONCLUSIONS: Comparatively high levels of trust in Chinese government advice about H7N9 contrast positively with previous pandemic communications in China. Anxiety helped drive both recommended and non-recommended behaviours, with potentially important economic and social implications. This included evidence of \u0027othering\u2019 of those associated with the threat (e.g. migrants).

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Hospitalisation data (2000\u20132010) for all government-funded hospitals in Hong Kong. POPULATION: Hospitalisation data for the entire Hong Kong population (7.0 million in 2011). METHODS: A decomposition method was used to determine the effects on total hospitalisation days during the period 2000\u20132010 of the following three factors: (i) hospitalisation rate per person; (ii) the number of visits per patient; and (iii) the mean duration of stay per visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The decomposition method provides empirical measures of how the three factors contributed to the change in total hospitalisation days during the period 2000\u20132010 and identifies the most effective way to contain increases in hospitalisation days. RESULTS: The results of decomposition analysis show that the decrease in mean duration of stay per visit (reducing from 6.83 to 4.58 days) is the most important factor in the reduction in the total number of hospitalisation days, despite increases in total population size (from 6.7 to 7.0 million), the number of individual hospital admissions (from 583 000 to 664 000) and the number of episodes (from 1.2 to 1.4 million) from 2000 to 2010. Hospitalisation days per person decreased from 1.18 in 2000 to 0.93 in 2010. The decline in the mean duration of stay per visit contributed 200.6% to this reduction but was offset by \u221251.1% due to a slight growth in the number of visits per patient and by \u221249.4% as a result of changed hospitalisation rates per person. CONCLUSIONS: Better management of the duration of stay of per visit without compromising patient satisfaction levels or the quality of service is the most important factor for controlling increases in health expenditure in Hong Kong.","publish_time":"2014-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yip, Paul S F; Lee, Carmen K M; Chow, Chun-Bong; Lo, William T L","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a802010092ba72fa679f88467ea9b53ac6725577.json; document_parses/pdf_json/eea1eb720701f6b9dbb08915e800964d963a933e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3948574.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3948574/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2Ozcw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["total hospitalisation days","total number of hospitalisation days","Hospitalisation data","hospitalisation rates","Hong Kong hospitalisation system","number of visits","mean duration","entire Hong Kong population","increases","number of episodes","person","total population size","decomposition method","important factor","results of decomposition analysis","factors","period","number of individual hospital admissions","reduction","patient satisfaction levels","empirical measures","MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES","health expenditure","quality of service","efficiency","government-funded hospitals","decrease","change","effects","effective way","CONCLUSIONS","Better management","slight growth","DESIGN","Retrospective study","METHODS","decline","SETTING","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

After successful expression of DENV type 2 NS1 protein, the genes of VHH antibodies against NS1 protein were biopanned from a non-immune llama library by phage display. VHH antibodies were then expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Simultaneously, monoclonal antibodies were obtained by the conventional route. Sequence analysis of the VHH antibodies revealed novel and long complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3). Epitope mapping was performed via a phage display peptide library using purified VHH and monoclonal antibodies as targets. Interestingly, the same region of NS1, which comprises amino acids (224)HWPKPHTLW(232), was conserved for both kinds of antibodies displaying the consensus motif histidine-tryptophan-tryptophan or tryptophan-proline-tryptophan. The two types of antibodies were used to prepare rapid diagnostic kits based on immunochromatographic assay. The VHH antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit showed better sensitivity and specificity than the monoclonal antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit, which might be due to the long CDR3 regions of the VHH antibodies and their ability to bind to the pocket and cleft of the targeted antigen. This demonstrates that VHH antibodies are likely to be an option for developing point-of-care tests against DENV infection.","publish_time":"2014-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fatima, Aneela; Wang, Haiying; Kang, Keren; Xia, Liliang; Wang, Ying; Ye, Wei; Wang, Jufang; Wang, Xiaoning","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/aca7762f80af606fe3c6d2614096db74f1398368.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3994031.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3994031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzExNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DENV","VHH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genes of VHH antibodies","kinds of antibodies","types of antibodies","VHH antibody","purified VHH","use of conventional monoclonal antibodies","NS1 protein","variable domain heavy-chain antibodies","monoclonal antibody","rapid diagnostic kits","diagnostic tools","tryptophan-proline","region of NS1","DENV infection","long CDR3 regions","phage display peptide library","consensus motif histidine-tryptophan","successful expression of DENV type","long complementarity","conventional route","non-immune llama library","better sensitivity","specificity","dengue virus","novel","pocket","care tests","immunochromatographic assay","targets","amino acids","Sequence analysis","cleft","targeted antigen","point","possibility","option","ability","Epitope mapping","HWPKPHTLW","Escherichia coli"],"language":"en"},

The optimal immunization ratios for acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization strategies were investigated, and the effectiveness of these three strategies in controlling the spreading of epidemics were analyzed based on realistic social contact networks. The results show all the strategies have decreased the coverage of the epidemics compared to baseline scenario (no control measures). However the effectiveness of acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization are very limited, with acquaintance immunization slightly outperforming community-bridge immunization. Ring vaccination significantly outperforms acquaintance immunization and community-bridge immunization, and the sensitivity analysis shows it could be applied to controlling the epidemics with a wide infectivity spectrum. The effectiveness of several classical stochastic immunization strategies was evaluated based on realistic contact networks for the first time in this study.

It is important to note that evolution has shaped the burden of disease in the modern world in which we practice and educate for public health. Human cultures and technologies have modified life on Planet Earth and have co-evolved with myriad other species, including microorganisms, plant and animal sources of food, invertebrate vectors of disease, and intermediate bird, mammal, and primate hosts. Molecular mechanisms of evolution have produced differential resistance or susceptibility to infectious agents, including malaria, plague, smallpox, TB, measles, and diarrheal and respiratory diseases. The domestication of sheep and cattle led to natural selection in favor of human populations able to digest milk throughout life through persistence into adulthood of lactase enzyme expression in the intestine, a major story of anthropology. The emergence of a \u201CWestern diet\u201D of dairy, refined cereal grains, refined sugars, vegetable oils, alcoholic beverages, salt, and omega-6-rich meats has dramatically altered glycemic load, fatty acid composition, macro-nutrients, acid-base balance, sodium/potassium ratio, and fiber content. This is a major story of nutrition and disease. The results include epidemics of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, certain cancers, and bowel, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders. Another interesting phenomenon is the selection of excessive hemostatic activity from platelets and the plasma clotting proteins; what was protective against death from bleeding after injuries among hunter-gatherers or from pregnancy-related hemorrhage now contributes to thrombosis underlying heart attacks and strokes. Conversely, there is little pressure against hemostasis and thrombosis since deaths from these causes occur mostly after the reproductive years of life. Learning about evolution over millennia for humans and over hours or days for microbes enlivens the experience of understanding evolutionary biology in public health context.","publish_time":"2011-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Omenn, Gilbert S.","journal":"Evolution: Education and Outreach","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/95d40a3f0574284f23807ee6f92620937db3ed93.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4160022.xml.json","url":"https://evolution-outreach.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1007/s12052-011-0382-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Planet Earth"],"keyphrases":["Public health courses","schools of public health","public health context","burden of disease","invertebrate vectors of disease","epidemics of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease","reproductive years of life","Molecular mechanisms of evolution","major story of anthropology","major story of nutrition","refined sugars","little pressure","Human cultures","refined cereal grains","acid-base balance","fatty acid composition","high blood pressure","thrombosis underlying heart attacks","favor of human populations able","obesity","diabetes","vegetable oils","macro-nutrients","osteoporosis","alcoholic beverages","glycemic load","certain cancers","differential resistance","measles","hunter-gatherers","bowel","platelets","plague","malaria","potassium ratio","infectious agents","animal sources of food","sodium","persistence","susceptibility","intermediate bird","intestine","dairy","milk","universities","selection of excessive hemostatic activity","adulthood of lactase enzyme expression","Planet Earth","evolutionary biology","popular undergraduate offerings","injuries","TB","plasma","omega","species","microorganisms","plant","salt","pregnancy-related hemorrhage","humans","experience","mammal","technologies","Western diet","hours","days","microbes","proteins","bleeding","rich meats","smallpox"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: RNA-seq library was created using RNA extracted from a mixed sample including leaf and root. A total of 33,238 unigenes were assembled from more than 28 million of high quality short reads. The quality of the assembly was experimentally examined by cDNA sequencing of seven randomly selected unigenes. Based on blast search 28,184 unigenes had a hit in at least one of the protein and nucleotide databases used in this study, and 8 unigenes were found to be associated with biosynthesis of indole and its derivatives. According to Gene Ontology classification, 22,365 unigenes were categorized into 48 functional groups. Furthermore, Clusters of Orthologous Group and Swiss-Port annotation were assigned for 7,707 and 18,679 unigenes, respectively. Analysis of repeat motifs identified 6,400 simple sequence repeat markers in 4,509 unigenes. CONCLUSION: Our data provide a comprehensive sequence resource for molecular study of I. indigotica.

The average relative content of lambda-IgGs and kappa \u2013IgGs in the case of CSFs (8.0 and 92.0%) and sera (12.3 and 87.7%) are comparable, while IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4: CSF - 40.4, 49.0, 8.2, and 2.5% of total IgGs, respectively and the sera - 53.6, 36.0, 5.6, and 4.8%, decreased in different order. Electrophoretically and immunologically homogeneous IgGs were obtained by sequential affinity chromatography of the CSF proteins on protein G-Sepharose and FPLC gel filtration. We present first evidence showing that IgGs from CSF efficiently hydrolyze MBP and that their average specific catalytic activity is unpredictably \u223C54-fold higher than that of Abs from sera of the same MS patients. Some possible reasons of these findings are discussed. We suggest that anti-MBP abzymes of CSF may promote important neuropathologic mechanisms in this chronic inflammatory disorder and in MS pathogenesis development.","publish_time":"2014-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Doronin, Visilii B.; Parkhomenko, Taisiya A.; Castellazzi, Massimiliano; Padroni, Marina; Pastore, Michela; Buneva, Valentina N.; Granieri, Enrico; Nevinsky, Georgy A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/db0f13123f5ba69c4a2b52b2d87fb2f5cd350c3c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4180057.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4180057/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MBP","CSF","FPLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sera of MS patients","CSF proteins","anti-MBP abzymes of CSF","hydrolysis of MBP","average content of lambda","possible MBP-hydrolyzing Abs","MS pathogenesis development","average relative content of lambda","IgG1-IgG4","kappa","average specific catalytic activity","possible reasons","different subclasses","different order","protein G-Sepharose","myelin basic protein","chronic inflammatory disorder","cerebrospinal fluid","important neuropathologic mechanisms","antibody response","available data","multiple sclerosis","major components","sequential affinity chromatography","FPLC gel filtration","IgG2","IgG3","antibodies","time","literature","findings","case of CSFs","Electrophoretically","total","evidence"],"language":"en"},

Sonic hedgehog (SHH) released from astrocytes plays an important role in the maintenance of BBB integrity. BBB disruption and microglial activation are common pathological features of various neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Interleukin-1\u03B2 (IL-1\u03B2), a major pro-inflammatory cytokine released from activated microglia, increases BBB permeability. Here we show that IL-1\u03B2 abolishes the protective effect of astrocytes on BBB integrity by suppressing astrocytic SHH production. Astrocyte conditioned media, SHH, or SHH signal agonist strengthened BBB integrity by upregulating tight junction proteins, whereas SHH signal inhibitor abrogated these effects. Moreover, IL-1\u03B2 increased astrocytic production of pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CCL2, CCL20, and CXCL2, which induce immune cell migration and exacerbate BBB disruption and neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that astrocytic SHH is a potential therapeutic target that could be used to restore disrupted BBB in patients with neurologic diseases.","publish_time":"2014-10-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Yue; Jin, Shijie; Sonobe, Yoshifumi; Cheng, Yi; Horiuchi, Hiroshi; Parajuli, Bijay; Kawanokuchi, Jun; Mizuno, Tetsuya; Takeuchi, Hideyuki; Suzumura, Akio","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a0304e5340ef8d016dd2f73d730072c2559acbb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4196962.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196962/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzI5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Sonic","BBB","SHH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BBB disruption","disrupted BBB","BBB permeability","maintenance of BBB integrity","astrocytic SHH production","SHH signal agonist","SHH signal inhibitor","astrocytic production of pro-inflammatory chemokines","perivascular astrocytes","protective effect of astrocytes","multiple sclerosis","major pro-inflammatory cytokine","Parkinson\u2019s disease","Alzheimer\u2019s disease","amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","common pathological features of various neurologic diseases","tight junction proteins","microglial activation","activated microglia","immune cell migration","CXCL2","pericytes","capillary endothelial cells","important role","central nervous system homeostasis","CCL20","potential therapeutic target","Astrocyte conditioned media","patients","blood","brain barrier","effects","neuroinflammation","Sonic hedgehog","Interleukin","findings"],"language":"en"},

This study investigated knowledge, attitudes and practices of LPTs relating to influenza A (H7N9). METHODS: Using multi-stage cluster sampling, 306 LPTs were interviewed in Guangzhou by a standardized questionnaire between mid-May to June, 2013. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with preventive practices and attitudes towards various control measures implemented in live poultry markets against H7N9. RESULTS: Only 46.1% of the respondents recognized risks associated with contacts with bird secretions or droppings, and only 22.9% perceived personally \u0022likely/very likely\u0022 to contract H7N9 infection. Around 60% of the respondents complied with hand-washing and wearing gloves, and only 20% reported wearing face masks. Only 16.3% of the respondents agreed on introducing central slaughtering of poultry. Being younger, involving in slaughtering poultry, having longer working hours, less access to H7N9-related information and poorer knowledge, and perceiving lower personal susceptibility to H7N9 infection were negatively associated with preventive practices. Comparing with previous studies conducted when human cases of H5N1 avian influenza infection was first identified in Guangdong, LPTs\u0027 perceived susceptibility to novel influenza viruses increased significantly but acceptance for central slaughtering of poultry remained low. CONCLUSIONS: Information on avian influenza provided through multiple communication tools may be necessary to promote knowledge among poultry traders. Familiarity with risk may have led to the lower perceived vulnerability to avian influenza and less protective actions among the LPTs particularly for those involving more risky exposure to live poultry. Reasons for the consistently low acceptance for central slaughtering of poultry await further exploration.

In recent years it has been associated with severe and fatal disease. The extent to which P. vivax contributes to death is not known. METHODS: To define the epidemiology of mortality attributable to vivax malaria in southern Papua, Indonesia, a retrospective clinical records-based audit was conducted of all deaths in patients with vivax malaria at a tertiary referral hospital. RESULTS: Between January 2004 and September 2009, hospital surveillance identified 3,495 inpatients with P. vivax monoinfection and 65 (1.9%) patients who subsequently died. Charts for 54 of these 65 patients could be reviewed, 40 (74%) of whom had pure P. vivax infections on cross-checking. Using pre-defined conservative criteria, vivax malaria was the primary cause of death in 6 cases, a major contributor in 17 cases and a minor contributor in a further 13 cases. Extreme anaemia was the most common primary cause of death. Malnutrition, sepsis with respiratory and gastrointestinal manifestations, and chronic diseases were the commonest attributed causes of death for patients in the latter two categories. There were an estimated 293,763 cases of pure P. vivax infection in the community during the study period giving an overall minimum case fatality of 0.12 per 1,000 infections. The corresponding case fatality in hospitalised patients was 10.3 per 1,000 infections.

We introduced smartphone data collection to replace paper-based data collection for an influenza sentinel surveillance system in four hospitals in Kenya. We compared the quality, cost and timeliness of data collection between the smartphone data collection system and the paper-based system. METHODS: Since 2006, the Kenya Ministry of Health (MoH) with technical support from the Kenya Medical Research Institute/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KEMRI/CDC) conducted hospital-based sentinel surveillance for influenza in Kenya. In May 2011, the MOH replaced paper-based collection with an electronic data collection system using Field Adapted Survey Toolkit (FAST) on HTC Touch Pro2 smartphones at four sentinel sites. We compared 880 paper-based questionnaires dated Jan 2010-Jun 2011 and 880 smartphone questionnaires dated May 2011-Jun 2012 from the four surveillance sites. For each site, we compared the quality, cost and timeliness of each data collection system. RESULTS: Incomplete records were more likely seen in data collected using pen-and-paper compared to data collected using smartphones (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 7, 95% CI: 4.4-10.3). Errors and inconsistent answers were also more likely to be seen in data collected using pen-and-paper compared to data collected using smartphones (aIRR: 25, 95% CI: 12.5-51.8). Smartphone data was uploaded into the database in a median time of 7 days while paper-based data took a median of 21 days to be entered (p \u003C 0.01). It cost USD 1,501 (9.4%) more to establish the smartphone data collection system ($17,500) than the pen-and-paper system (USD $15,999). During two years, however, the smartphone data collection system was $3,801 (7%) less expensive to operate ($50,200) when compared to pen-and-paper system ($54,001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to paper-based data collection, an electronic data collection system produced fewer incomplete data, fewer errors and inconsistent responses and delivered data faster. Although start-up costs were higher, the overall costs of establishing and running the electronic data collection system were lower compared to paper-based data collection system. Electronic data collection using smartphones has potential to improve timeliness, data integrity and reduce costs.","publish_time":"2014-12-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Njuguna, Henry N; Caselton, Deborah L; Arunga, Geoffrey O; Emukule, Gideon O; Kinyanjui, Dennis K; Kalani, Rosalia M; Kinkade, Carl; Muthoka, Phillip M; Katz, Mark A; Mott, Joshua A","journal":"BMC Med Inform Decis Mak","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d1eecf25e925b3c331a75d38e687648718e2d4f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4305246.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4305246/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzM4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Kenya Ministry of Health","MOH","Field Adapted Survey Toolkit"],"locations":["Kenya"],"keyphrases":["paper-based data collection system","smartphone data collection system","timeliness of data collection","electronic data collection system","manual data collection","paper-based collection","data integrity","paper system","paper-based system","fewer incomplete data","paper-based questionnaires","influenza sentinel surveillance system","smartphone questionnaires","hospital-based sentinel surveillance","pen","disease surveillance","surveillance sites","fewer errors","sentinel sites","median time","Kenya Ministry of Health","aIRR","MoH","days","overall costs","start-up costs","quality","USD","HTC Touch Pro2 smartphones","Kenya Medical Research Institute","Disease Control","Incomplete records","time consuming","inconsistent responses","inconsistent answers","Field Adapted Survey Toolkit","Centers","technical support","potential","CDC","adjusted incidence rate ratio","Prevention","KEMRI","hospitals","database","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","years","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The absence of this signalling cascade in naive Ceacam1(\u2212/\u2212) mice limits the survival of B cells. During systemic infection with cytopathic vesicular stomatitis virus, Ceacam1(\u2212/\u2212) mice can barely induce neutralizing antibody responses and die early after infection.

This is surprising given the key role that hospitals play in the delivery of healthcare services and the large proportion of health systems resources that they absorb. To explore the factors that impact upon priority setting at the hospital level, we conducted a thematic review of empirical studies. A systematic search of PubMed, EBSCOHOST, Econlit databases and Google scholar was supplemented by a search of key websites and a manual search of relevant papers\u2019 reference lists. A total of 24 papers were identified from developed and developing countries. We applied a policy analysis framework to examine and synthesize the findings of the selected papers. Findings suggest that priority setting practice in hospitals was influenced by (1) contextual factors such as decision space, resource availability, financing arrangements, availability and use of information, organizational culture and leadership, (2) priority setting processes that depend on the type of priority setting activity, (3) content factors such as priority setting criteria and (4) actors, their interests and power relations. We observe that there is need for studies to examine these issues and the interplay between them in greater depth and propose a conceptual framework that might be useful in examining priority setting practices in hospitals.","publish_time":"2014-03-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barasa, Edwine W; Molyneux, Sassy; English, Mike; Cleary, Susan","journal":"Health Policy Plan","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d708b6876813c3915edcbdda08c014d90ec694ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4353893.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4353893/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIuY3N2OzQzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1973552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"oWyf6Mw8mITnlAyV2FsWBg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_2.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Google"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["type of priority","hospitals","hospital level","search of key websites","content factors","contextual factors","findings","systematic search of PubMed","resource availability","conceptual framework","key role","selected papers","manual search of relevant papers\u2019 reference lists","policy analysis framework","thematic review of empirical studies","EBSCOHOST","decision space","financing arrangements","Econlit databases","large proportion of health systems resources","information","delivery of healthcare services","Google scholar","meso","greater depth","micro","bedside","leadership","activity","criteria","organizational culture","interests","power relations","macro","interplay","practices","impact","issues","research","processes","total","countries"],"language":"en"},

We demonstrate that central pathophysiologic events in ALI (inflammation, IL-1\u03B2 levels, endothelial and alveolar epithelial barrier permeability, remodelling and fibrosis) are attenuated in the lungs of Vim(\u2212/\u2212) mice challenged with LPS, bleomycin and asbestos.

Furthermore, decreased active caspase-1 and IL-1\u03B2 levels are observed in vitro in Vim(\u2212/\u2212) and vimentin-knockdown macrophages.

In this study, the complete nucleotide coding sequences of TP53 gene from eight different mammalian species were used for CUB analysis.

Drawing mostly from the experience of Zambia, it analyzes food safety actors and interests in Sub-Saharan Africa, and provides an outline of the general regulatory framework that is in place on the continent, to explain how food safety governance is impacted by different interest groups and agendas. Two case studies are provided, zoonotic tuberculosis and avian influenza. The chapter demonstrates how the two zoonoses, both important food safety concerns, have been prioritized differently in the case of Zambia, as a result of multiple socio-political and economic factors. The chapter concludes that, in order to be useful, a definition of food safety risks should include multiple contextual issues and stakeholders along the food supply chain. It is important to keep in mind what national food safety governance actors perceive the risks to be, and how their definitions fit into the broader picture of food safety in general. Food safety governance regulatory processes should take into consideration local realities, local food supply chains and local food safety threats to ensure the appropriateness and sustainability of any and all disease control measures instituted. Context will always matter, and therefore, local ecological, biological and policy considerations should be given primacy.","publish_time":"2016-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mwacalimba, Kennedy","journal":"International Food Law and Policy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/281fe16180b403e2db61fff528f825b074669d2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7138434.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138434/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs1NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Sub-Saharan Africa"],"keyphrases":["food safety actors","local food safety threats","definition of food safety risks","important food safety concerns","broader picture of food safety","national food safety governance actors","Food safety governance regulatory processes","local food supply chains","chapter","consideration local realities","Sub-Saharan Africa","case of Zambia","general regulatory framework","disease control measures","economic factors","experience of Zambia","case studies","multiple contextual issues","result of multiple socio-political","agro-economic environment","stakeholders","mind","interests","zoonotic tuberculosis","policy considerations","public health","animal production","outline","zoonoses","concept of risk","place","sustainability","appropriateness","avian influenza","order","groups","continent","agendas","primacy","definitions"],"language":"en"},

The patients had severe burn injuries and were considered to be at high-risk of both the carriage and acquisition of multi-resistant organisms (MROs). Whilst seeking to protect the Bali patients with a comprehensive infection control response, we also sought to protect other high-risk patients from nosocomial acquisition of MROs. MROs were detected from 25 (82%) of the 29 Bali patients admitted to RPH. Bali patients were colonised, or infected, with one or more of the following MROs: multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) (19 patients), extended-spectrum \u00DF-lactamase (ESBL) producing Gram-negative bacteria (15 patients), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (nine patients), multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MRPA) (six patients), multi-resistant Chryseobacterium sp. (four patients), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (three patients). Five Bali patients developed a total of eight bacteraemic episodes, with MRPA sepsis contributing to death in two patients. Since the Bali bombings horizontal transmission of Bali MROs has occurred in 41 non-Bali patients in RPH. MRPA has had the greatest clinical impact. Eight non-Bali patients developed a total of 11 bacteraemic episodes, with MRPA sepsis contributing to death in four patients. However, apart from MRPA, we have now controlled transmission of the other MROs in RPH. The emergency response to the Bali disaster required strong leadership, good communication and multi-disciplinary teamwork. The infection control strategy contributed to good outcomes for most Bali bombing patients. However, many patients within the Bali cohort were heavily colonised with MROs, and some developed invasive infection. Subsequent nosocomial transmission of these MROs to non-Bali patients has been a legacy of the Bali tragedy.","publish_time":"2016-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heath, Christopher H; Orrell, C Terri; Lee, Rosie CE; Pearman, John W; McCullough, Cheryll; Christiansen, Keryn J","journal":"Aust Infect Control","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7146777/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs2OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MRPA"],"locations":["Royal Perth Hospital","Bali"],"keyphrases":["non-Bali patients","high-risk patients","Bali disaster","Bali cohort","Bali tragedy","Bali bombings horizontal transmission of Bali MROs","following MROs","multi-resistant Chryseobacterium","nosocomial acquisition of MROs","RPH","acquisition of multi-resistant organisms","MRPA sepsis","multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii","multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa","vancomycin-resistant enterococci","multi-disciplinary teamwork","developed invasive infection","methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","bacteraemic episodes","total","comprehensive infection control response","infection control strategy","Subsequent nosocomial transmission","death","good communication","good outcomes","emergency response","strong leadership","ESBL","MRSA","carriage","MRAB","legacy","Gram-negative bacteria","spectrum \u00DF-lactamase","Royal Perth Hospital","VRE","greatest clinical impact","severe burn injuries"],"language":"en"},

The region of the virus genome associated with neurovirulence maps to the P1 region, encoding the capsid proteins, and to the 5\u2032 non-coding region. There is evidence that BeAnDA virus persists in oligodendrocytes, where it reactivates to initiate demyelinating disease. Host factors are involved in the development of the lesion, including CD4(\u002B) T cell responses. These lymphocytes most probably mediate damage through activation of macrophages leading to local destruction of glial cells. Another possible pathological role for the immune system is the recognition of nerve cell antigens and the initiation of autoimmune disease. Such a virus-triggered phenomenon may well underlie human CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis.","publish_time":"2004-11-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nash, Anthony A.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147886/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MHC","CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus genome","BeAnDA virus","chronic demyelinating disease","Theiler\u0027s virus strains GDVII","chronic infection","virus-triggered phenomenon","P1 region","initiation of autoimmune disease","non-coding region","persistent infection","T cell responses","recognition of nerve cell antigens","immune system","human CNS diseases","activation of macrophages","CD4","neurovirulence maps","acute encephalitis","local destruction of glial cells","development","multiple sclerosis","possible pathological role","mice","mouse strain","susceptibility","damage","capsid proteins","evidence","oligodendrocytes","D locus","MHC","Host factors","lymphocytes","lesion"],"language":"en"},

While the former opens up new opportunities, the latter introduces new challenges with heterogeneous, historical and noisy inputs. If NE processing tools are increasingly being used in the context of historical documents, performance values are below the ones on contemporary data and are hardly comparable. In this context, this paper introduces the CLEF 2020 Evaluation Lab HIPE (Identifying Historical People, Places and other Entities) on named entity recognition and linking on diachronic historical newspaper material in French, German and English.

This work focuses on one such application: disaster management in times of crises and calamities. The existing research on disaster damage analysis has primarily taken only unimodal information in the form of text or image into account. These unimodal systems, although useful, fail to model the relationship between the various modalities. Different modalities often present supporting facts about the task, and therefore, learning them together can enhance performance. We present MEMIS, a system that can be used in emergencies like disasters to identify and analyze the damage indicated by user-generated multimodal social media posts, thereby helping the disaster management groups in making informed decisions. Our leave-one-disaster-out experiments on a multimodal dataset suggest that not only does fusing information in different media forms improves performance, but that our system can also generalize well to new disaster categories. Further qualitative analysis reveals that the system is responsive and computationally efficient.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agarwal, Mansi; Leekha, Maitree; Sawhney, Ramit; Ratn Shah, Rajiv; Kumar Yadav, Rajesh; Kumar Vishwakarma, Dinesh","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a22c22aa198a21ab4c074b48a61e9e34e426e0c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148216.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["disaster damage analysis","disaster management groups","unimodal information","new disaster categories","usage of social media","multimodal social media posts","different media forms","Different modalities","performance","qualitative analysis","multimodal dataset","unimodal systems","present MEMIS","various modalities","present supporting facts","form of text","user","times of crises","multimedia data","application","informed decisions","existing research","recent upsurge","image","account","relationship","task","calamities","experiments","disasters","emergencies","decision-making","fields","researchers","work","leave"],"language":"en"},

The standard insights extraction pipeline is typically an unsupervised machine learning task composed of processes that preprocess the text, visualize it, cluster and identify the topics and sentiment in each cluster, and then graph the network. Given the increasing amount of data being generated on the internet in Africa today, and the multilingual state of African countries, we evaluated how well the standard pipeline works when applied to text wholly or partially written in indigenous African languages, specifically Bantu languages. We carried out an exploratory investigation using Twitter data and compared the outputs from each step of the pipeline for an English dataset and a mixed Bantu language dataset. We found that for Bantu languages, due to their complex grammatical structure, extra preprocessing steps such as part-of-speech tagging and morphological analysis are required during data cleaning, threshold values should be adjusted during topic modeling, and semantic analysis should be performed before completing text preprocessing.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nchabeleng, Mathibele; Byamugisha, Joan","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c663e5b83135937b7e702835496abfc5ba5cc338.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148238.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148238/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs5MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["Bantu languages","data cleaning","Twitter data","standard pipeline","text preprocessing","indigenous African languages","standard insights extraction pipeline","cluster","mixed Bantu language dataset","English dataset","various topics","morphological analysis","semantic analysis","extra preprocessing steps","multilingual state of African countries","opinions","people\u2019s views","complex grammatical structure","unsupervised machine learning task","processes","order","web","topic modeling","threshold values","outputs","growing practice","exploratory investigation","sentiment","speech","internet","network"],"language":"en"},

We train linear functions by using samples of ordered entities as training data, and attributes of entities as features. An example of such functions is f(Entity) [Formula: see text] (Police budget) [Formula: see text] (Crime rate), for ordering countries in terms of safety. As the size of training data is typically small in this task, we propose a machine learning method referred to as context-guided learning (CGL) to overcome the over-fitting problem. Exploiting a large amount of contexts regarding relations between the labeling criteria (e.g. safety) and attributes, CGL guides learning in the correct direction by estimating a roughly appropriate weight for each attribute by the contexts. This idea was implemented by a regularization approach similar to support vector machines. Experiments were conducted with 158 kinds of orders in three datasets. The experimental results showed high effectiveness of the contextual guidance over existing ranking methods.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kato, Makoto P.; Imrattanatrai, Wiradee; Yamamoto, Takehiro; Ohshima, Hiroaki; Tanaka, Katsumi","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ecb81dc0d3d43988f8e8ce41b4b7075e6b939595.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148248.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148248/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs5MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["learning entity orders","machine learning method","attributes of entities","terms of safety","Formula","livability orders of countries","context-guided learning","kinds of orders","example","contexts","size of training data","CGL guides","ordering countries","linear functions","samples of ordered entities","contextual guidance","regularization approach similar","high effectiveness","support vector machines","popularity","correct direction","Crime rate","labeling criteria","existing ranking methods","appropriate weight","relations","task","Police budget","experimental results","over-fitting problem","idea","datasets","features","Experiments"],"language":"en"},

Addressing this task is necessary to the automatic recommendation of appropriate articles to readers with different comprehension abilities, and it further benefits education systems, web information systems, and digital libraries. Current methods for assessing readability employ empirical measures or statistical learning techniques that are limited by their ability to characterize complex patterns such as article structures and semantic meanings of sentences. In this paper, we propose a new and comprehensive framework which uses a hierarchical self-attention model to analyze document readability. In this model, measurements of sentence-level difficulty are captured along with the semantic meanings of each sentence. Additionally, the sentence-level features are incorporated to characterize the overall readability of an article with consideration of article structures. We evaluate our proposed approach on three widely-used benchmark datasets against several strong baseline approaches. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on estimating the readability for various web articles and literature.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meng, Changping; Chen, Muhao; Mao, Jie; Neville, Jennifer","journal":"Advances in Information Retrieval","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a9bcbac59689c5fa9e3882e7e25a0863defedff9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7148251.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148251/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzE3LmNzdjs5MTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":691354,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:31Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"HggH\u002B6Ado3dgVDKH6UyFww==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_17.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["readability of articles","document readability","overall readability","various web articles","consideration of article structures","measurements of sentence","sentence-level features","web information systems","semantic meanings of sentences","automatic recommendation of appropriate articles","proposed method","level difficulty","proposed approach","benefits education systems","important sociolinguistic task","hierarchical self-attention model","readers","empirical measures","different comprehension abilities","statistical learning techniques","benchmark datasets","comprehensive framework","complex patterns","state-of-the-art performance","strong baseline approaches","digital libraries","literature","Current methods","Experimental results","paper"],"language":"en"},

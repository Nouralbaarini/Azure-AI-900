Results revealed that males and females presented a different social cognitive pattern in reaction to A (H1N1) pandemic. In females, the effects of risk perception/self-efficacy on handwashing behaviors were fully mediated by handwashing intentions. In males, self-efficacy influenced both directly and indirectly on handwashing behaviors, and risk perceptions showed no significant effect on handwashing behaviors. These results suggest that gender oriented protocols should be adopted by public health authorities in order to educate males and females in preventing both A (H1N1) and seasonal influenza.","publish_time":"2012-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guti\u00E9rrez-Do\u00F1a, Benicio; Renner, Britta; Reuter, Tabea; Giese, Helge; Schubring, David","journal":"Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da52bc30f65ff8b0a179d27368458780d671090c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812016941; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.05.565; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877042812016941; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288894/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["handwashing behaviors","handwashing intentions","self-efficacy","females","H1N1","effects of risk perception","risk perceptions","Results","pandemic influenza","seasonal influenza","reaction","different social cognitive pattern","longitudinal sample of Costa Ricans","NT1","order","significant effect","relations","public health authorities","gender oriented protocols","T2","study","Data"],"language":"en"},

We hypothesized that variations in the incidence of NEC were random, without clustering. In order to define the pattern of NEC in the United States, we analyzed the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database to evaluate whether NEC cases are distributed randomly or exhibit temporal clustering or periodicity. METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval, we queried the PHIS database for all patients with NEC (ICD-9 code of 777.5) over a 13-year period. Sixteen children\u2019s hospitals were studied, and individual institutional and aggregate data were reviewed. Fisher\u2019s Kappa and Bartlett\u2019s Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov tests were used to identify periodicity. RESULTS: During the study interval, there were 2,93,076 neonatal admissions, and 4,559 (1.6%) infants were diagnosed with NEC. Statistical analysis demonstrates a periodicity of 6 months in the occurrence of NEC. Fisher\u2019s Kappa was 16.924 and Bartlett\u2019s Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov was 0.281, which translates to a P value of \u003C0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a national database analysis it appears a temporally non-random distribution of NEC cases does exist.","publish_time":"2010-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Snyder, Charles L.; Hall, Matt; Sharma, Vidya; St. Peter, Shawn D.","journal":"Pediatr Surg Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8159a6b19b67b1b3cb65a91c4a7d6e9584fb6dce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087736.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20665217/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-010-2675-5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Necrotizing","Fisher","Bartlett"],"organizations":["NEC","Pediatric Health Information System","IRB","PHIS"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["pattern of NEC","incidence of NEC","occurrence of NEC","non-random distribution of NEC cases","periodicity","PHIS database","Bartlett\u2019s Kolmogorov","national database analysis","Fisher\u2019s Kappa","clusters of cases","Smirnov tests","Statistical analysis","temporal clustering","Pediatric Health Information System","United States","basis","months","patients","study interval","IRB approval","aggregate data","sporadic manner","BACKGROUND","Necrotizing enterocolitis","ICD","neonatal admissions","children\u2019s hospitals","RESULTS","METHODS","variations","code","order","year period","P value","CONCLUSIONS","infants"],"language":"en"},

Chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and bronchial asthma may all be associated with airflow limitation; therefore, exacerbation of asthma may be associated with the pathophysiology of COPD. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that the exacerbation of asthma, namely virus-induced asthma, may be associated with a wide variety of respiratory viruses. COPD and asthma have different underlying pathophysiological processes and thus require individual therapies. Exacerbation of both COPD and asthma, which are basically defined and diagnosed by clinical symptoms, is associated with a rapid decline in lung function and increased mortality. Similar pathogens, including human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus, are also frequently detected during exacerbation of asthma and/or COPD. Immune response to respiratory viral infections, which may be related to the severity of exacerbation in each disease, varies in patients with both COPD and asthma. In this regard, it is crucial to recognize and understand both the similarities and differences of clinical features in patients with COPD and/or asthma associated with respiratory viral infections, especially in the exacerbative stage. In relation to definition, epidemiology, and pathophysiology, this review aims to summarize current knowledge concerning exacerbation of both COPD and asthma by focusing on the clinical significance of associated respiratory virus infections.","publish_time":"2013-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kurai, Daisuke; Saraya, Takeshi; Ishii, Haruyuki; Takizawa, Hajime","journal":"Front Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f9f22f0d245cf41e5047230fa1c907b47a734ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3787546.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098299/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00293","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["exacerbation of asthma","bronchial asthma","virus-induced asthma","pathophysiology of COPD","clinical significance of associated respiratory virus infections","respiratory syncytial virus","severity of exacerbation","respiratory viral infections","parainfluenza virus","pulmonary emphysema","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","airflow limitation","wide variety of respiratory viruses","patients","Chronic bronchitis","clinical symptoms","differences of clinical features","chronic airway inflammation","human rhinovirus","different underlying pathophysiological processes","rapid decline","lung function","increased mortality","epidemiology","review","Immune response","current knowledge","individual therapies","Similar pathogens","definition","similarities","coronavirus","exacerbative stage","relation","recent studies","regard"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we first investigate inhomogeneous site percolation on Bethe Lattices with two occupation probabilities, and then extend the result to percolation with m occupation probabilities. The critical behaviour of this inhomogeneous percolation is shown clearly by formulating the percolation probability [Image: see text] with given occupation probability p, the critical occupation probability [Image: see text], and the average cluster size [Image: see text] where p is subject to [Image: see text]. Moreover, using the above theory, we discuss in detail the diffusion behaviour of an infectious disease (SARS) and present specific disease-control strategies in consideration of groups with different infection probabilities.","publish_time":"2016-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ren, Jingli; Zhang, Liying; Siegmund, Stefan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/343aeda9b3a81a9db2f40386f3991ef6c48338ce.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4772486.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26926785/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep22420","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsxMzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bethe Lattices"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["percolation probability","text","Image","inhomogeneous site percolation","occupation probabilities","critical occupation probability","theoretical framework of inhomogeneous percolation","critical behaviour","given occupation probability p","critical phenomena","diffusion behaviour","different infection probabilities","infectious disease","dynamical behaviour of complex networks","present specific disease-control strategies","consideration of groups","SARS","Bethe Lattices","average cluster size","closer relationship","result","challenging problems","intricacy","paper","theory"],"language":"en"},

The ability of CLRs to elicit and shape adaptive immunity plays a critical role in the inhibition of viral spread within the host. However, certain viruses exploit CLRs for viral entry into host cells to avoid immune recognition. To block CLR interactions with viral glycoproteins, antiviral strategies may involve the use of multivalent glycan carrier systems.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are essential in this process, serving as the cellular link between innate and adaptive immunity. As a prerequisite for priming of adaptive immune responses, DCs must take up tumor antigens, process them and present them in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). DCs also serve as sensors of innate activation signals from cancer that are necessary for their activation and effective priming of cancer specific T cells. Here we discuss the role of DCs in the sensing of cancer and in priming the adaptive response against tumors.

This study introduces a medium flow swirling bioaerosol sampler (SAS) approach that collects atmospheric bioaerosols at the flow rate of 167 Lpm (10 cubic meter per hour). The collection of bioaerosols is achieved through a combination of impaction and cyclonic centrifugal motion. Aerosol deposition efficiency tests were performed with monodispersive polystyrene latex (PSL) particles ranging from 0.1 to 10 \u03BCm. Results have shown that the sampler has cut\u2013off size of 0.7 \u03BCm and 1.5 \u03BCm, with and without the assistance of added water vapor, respectively. The bioaerosol collection and viability tests were performed with comparison to the commercially\u2013available BioSampler, and the results show that the collection efficiency of the SAS is 97% at the designed flow rate, while the higher flow of the new system yields more than 13 times of the collection rate compared to the BioSampler.

Many species of bats are insectivorous while others are frugivorous and few of them are hematophagous. Some of these animals fly during the night, others are crepuscular or diurnal. Some fly long distances during seasonal migrations. Many species are colonial cave-dwelling, living in a rather small home range while others are relatively solitary. However, in spite of the importance of bats for terrestrial biotic communities and ecosystem ecology, the diversity in their biology and lifestyles remain poorly known and underappreciated. More than sixty viruses have been detected or isolated in bats; these animals are therefore involved in the natural cycles of many of them. This is the case, for instance, of rabies virus and other Lyssavirus (Family Rhabdoviridae), Nipah and Hendra viruses (Paramyxoviridae), Ebola and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Coronaviridae). For these zoonotic viruses, a number of bat species are considered as important reservoir hosts, efficient disseminators or even directly responsible of the transmission. Some of these bat-borne viruses cause highly pathogenic diseases while others are of potential significance for humans and domestic or wild animals; so, bats are an important risk in human and animal public health. Moreover, some groups of viruses developed through different phylogenetic mechanisms of coevolution between viruses and bats. The fact that most of these viral infections are asymptomatic in bats has been observed since a long time but the mechanisms of the viral persistence are not clearly understood. The various bioecology of the different bat populations allows exchange of virus between migrating and non-migrating conspecific species. For a better understanding of the role of bats in the circulation of these viral zoonoses, epidemiologists must pay attention to some of their biologic properties which are not fully documented, like their extreme longevity, their diet, the population size and the particular densities observed in species with crowded roosting behavior, the population structure and migrations, the hibernation permitting overwintering of viruses, their particular innate and acquired immune response, probably related at least partially to their ability to fly, allowing persistent virus infections and preventing immunopathological consequences, etc. It is also necessary to get a better knowledge of the interactions between bats and ecologic changes induced by man and to attentively follow bat populations and their viruses through surveillance networks involving human and veterinary physicians, specialists of wild fauna, ecologists, etc. in order to understand the mechanisms of disease emergence, to try to foresee and, perhaps, to prevent viral emergences beforehand. Finally, a more fundamental research about immune mechanisms developed in viral infections is essential to reveal the reasons why Chiroptera are so efficient reservoir hosts. Clearly, a great deal of additional work is needed to document the roles of bats in the natural history of viruses.","publish_time":"2015-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rodhain, F.","journal":"Bull Soc Pathol Exot","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/258351842f4a43800260e394172430a9523b8a73.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26330152/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13149-015-0448-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjsyNDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hendra"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species of bats","importance of bats","roles of bats","role of bats","Hendra viruses","Marburg viruses","overwintering of viruses","groups of viruses","zoonotic viruses","natural history of viruses","viral infections","number of bat species","immune mechanisms","viral zoonoses","viral persistence","viral emergences","different bat populations","non-migrating conspecific species","Order Chiroptera","wild animals","persistent virus infections","important reservoir hosts","exchange of virus","rabies virus","important risk","different phylogenetic mechanisms of coevolution","efficient reservoir hosts","mechanisms of disease emergence","fly long distances","diverse order of Mammals","population structure","particular densities","population size","SARS-CoV","efficient disseminators","MERS-CoV","seasonal migrations","immune response","better knowledge","better understanding","long time","natural cycles","specialists of wild fauna","veterinary physicians","surveillance networks","terrestrial biotic communities","crowded roosting behavior","ecosystem ecology","Nipah","Family Rhabdoviridae","Ebola","Paramyxoviridae","diversity","potential significance","Lyssavirus","attention","humans","interactions","Filoviridae","reasons","hibernation","circulation","flying foxes","animal public health","immunopathological consequences","diet","epidemiologists","ecologists","ecologic changes","pathogenic diseases","various bioecology","fundamental research","great deal of additional work","colonial cave-dwelling","small home range","lifestyles","biology","night","instance","Rodents","Coronaviridae","extreme longevity","diurnal","biologic properties","case","ability","spite","fact","transmission"],"language":"en"},

In the first two decades of the 21st century, we have born witness to the emergence of newly recognized coronaviruses that have rapidly spread around the globe, including severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome virus (MERS). We have also experienced the emergence of a novel H1N1 pandemic influenza strain in 2009 that caused substantial morbidity and mortality around the world and has transitioned into a seasonal strain. Although we perhaps most frequently think of viruses when discussing emerging respiratory infections, bacteria have not been left out of the mix, as we have witnessed an increase in the number of infections from Legionella spp. since the organisms\u2019 initial discovery in 1976.

Effective respiratory hygiene in the ED is imperative to limit the spread of dangerous respiratory pathogens, including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and bioterrorism agents, particularly given that these agents may not be immediately identifiable. Sustaining effective respiratory control measures is especially challenging in the ED because of patient crowding, inadequate staffing and resources, and ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients. Threat of contagion exists not only for ED patients but also for visitors, health care workers, and inpatient populations. Potential physical sites for respiratory disease transmission extend from out-of-hospital care, to triage, waiting room, ED treatment area, and the hospital at large. This article presents a summary of the most current information available in the literature about respiratory hygiene in the ED, including administrative, patient, and legal issues. Wherever possible, specific recommendations and references to practical information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are provided. The \u201CAdministrative Issues\u201D section describes coordination with public health departments, procedures for effective facility planning, and measures for health care worker protection (education, staffing optimization, and vaccination). The patient care section addresses the potentially infected ED patient, including emergency medical services concerns, triage planning, and patient transport. \u201CLegal Issues\u201D discusses the interplay between public safety and patient privacy. Emergency physicians play a critical role in early identification, treatment, and containment of potentially lethal respiratory pathogens. This brief synopsis should help clinicians and administrators understand, develop, and implement appropriate policies and procedures to address respiratory hygiene in the ED.","publish_time":"2007-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rothman, Richard E.; Irvin, Charlene B.; Moran, Gregory J.; Sauer, Lauren; Bradshaw, Ylisabyth S.; Fry, Robert B.; Josephine, Elaine B.; Ledyard, Holly K.; Hirshon, Jon Mark","journal":"Journal of Emergency Nursing","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/bbb727ab78e299a712b0be35b84f6448fc9fea8f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112270.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0099176707000591; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0099176707000591","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ED"],"organizations":["Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Effective respiratory hygiene","infected ED patient","effective respiratory control measures","respiratory disease transmission","patient care section","lethal respiratory pathogens","patient crowding","patient privacy","patient transport","ED treatment area","severe acute respiratory syndrome","spread of dangerous respiratory pathogens","control of acute respiratory infectious threats","health care workers","hospital care","public health departments","health care worker protection","Disease Control","Administrative Issues","legal issues","public health response plan","effective facility planning","public safety","procedures","triage planning","Emergency physicians","emergency department","avian influenza","inadequate staffing","practical information","staffing optimization","emergency medical services concerns","bioterrorism agents","current information available","ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients","resources","education","coordination","references","critical role","Centers","containment","essential component","interplay","literature","early identification","specific recommendations","Potential physical sites","visitors","summary","inpatient populations","room","appropriate policies","brief synopsis","clinicians","administrators","vaccination","Prevention","Threat of contagion","article"],"language":"en"},

Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host responses to viruses from different families while controlling other experimental parameters. Murine models are commonly used to study the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, and in vitro studies using murine cells provide mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis observed in vivo. We used microarray analysis to compare changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1. Our comparative approach identified universal and specific transcriptional signatures of virus infection that can be used to distinguish shared and virus-specific mechanisms of pathogenesis in the respiratory tract.","publish_time":"2017-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"VanLeuven, James T.; Ridenhour, Benjamin J.; Gonzalez, Andres J.; Miller, Craig R.; Miura, Tanya A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b460e5b511b4e2c3233f9476cd4e0616d6f405ac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5456070.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28575086/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory viruses","MHV","host gene expression","PR8","host defense genes","RV1B infection","antiviral genes","host responses","murine cells","Signature genes","diverse viruses","gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells","pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections","numerous gene expression changes","virus-specific mechanisms of pathogenesis","respiratory tract","tissue remodeling genes","intermediate number of genes","infected lung epithelial cells","severity of respiratory viral infections","specific transcriptional signatures of virus infection","studies","unique responses","overlapping responses","hours post-infection","Murine models","cellular response","interferon response","Disease prevention","different families","differential effect","understanding","rhinovirus","mechanistic insight","comparative approach","transcription factors","treatment","lower type","influenza","effects","microarray analysis","experimental parameters","coronavirus","mice"],"language":"en"},

In addition to the previously demonstrated pathogenic roles of prions during the development of different mammalian diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, they have recently been shown to represent an important functional component in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and bacteriophages, confirming the previously unexplored important regulatory and functional roles. However, an in-depth analysis of these domains in eukaryotic viruses has not been performed. Here, we examined the presence of prion-like proteins in eukaryotic viruses that play a primary role in different ecosystems and that are associated with emerging diseases in humans. We identified relevant functional associations in different viral processes and regularities in their presence at different taxonomic levels. Using the prion-like amino-acid composition computational algorithm, we detected 2679 unique putative prion-like domains within 2,742,160 publicly available viral protein sequences. Our findings indicate that viral prion-like proteins can be found in different viruses of insects, plants, mammals, and humans. The analysis performed here demonstrated common patterns in the distribution of prion-like domains across viral orders and families, and revealed probable functional associations with different steps of viral replication and interaction with host cells. These data allow the identification of the viral prion-like proteins as potential novel regulators of viral infections.","publish_time":"2018-06-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tetz, George; Tetz, Victor","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/be7d22507f45b2b2927f91d16d7b89c1bf2c35cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5997743.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-27256-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29895872/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral prion","different viral processes","viral orders","presence of prion","different steps of viral replication","different ecosystems","distribution of prion","different viruses of insects","domains","functional roles","eukaryotic viruses","misfolding of proteins","development of different mammalian diseases","different taxonomic levels","unique putative prion","available viral protein sequences","probable functional associations","relevant functional associations","important functional component","potential novel regulators of viral infections","eukaryotic organisms","neurodegenerative diseases","emerging diseases","humans","pathogenic roles of prions","in-depth analysis","regularities","interaction","families","amino-acid composition computational algorithm","bacteriophages","plants","primary role","mammals","host cells","common patterns","identification","addition","data","findings"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we investigate the role of disulfide bond formation in the folding, assembly, and stability of BVDV glycoproteins. We provide molecular evidence that intact disulfide bonds are critical for the acquirement of a stable conformation of E2 monomers. Forcing the E2 glycoproteins to adopt a reduced conformation either co- or post-translationally before assembly into dimers, determines their misfolding and degradation by proteasome. In contrast, dimerization of E2 glycoproteins results in a conformation resistant to reducing agents and degradation. Furthermore, inhibition of the ER-\u03B1-mannosidase activity leads to impairment of misfolded E2 degradation, demonstrating the involvement of this enzyme in targeting viral proteins towards proteasomal degradation.","publish_time":"2002-08-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Branza-Nichita, Norica; Lazar, Catalin; Durantel, David; Dwek, Raymond A; Zitzmann, Nicole","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28d9aa67c285031bfe42e26822d1af9427dcb6e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111099.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X02009075; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X02009075","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BVDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["dimerization of E2 glycoproteins results","impairment of misfolded E2 degradation","stable conformation of E2 monomers","proteasomal degradation","stability of BVDV glycoproteins","conformation resistant","assembly","reduced conformation","intact disulfide bonds","role of disulfide bond formation","viral proteins","Abstract Bovine viral diarrhea virus","hepatitis C virus","acquirement","mannosidase activity","involvement","ER-\u03B1","pestivirus member","molecular evidence","surrogate model","enzyme","misfolding","contrast","homo","E1","Flaviviridae family","agents","envelope","inhibition","heterodimers","proteasome","study"],"language":"en"},

For hepatitis B virus, that interval was 30 years; for non-A, non-B/hepatitis C virus, 15 years; and for human immunodeficiency virus, West Nile virus, Trypanosoma cruzi, and bacteria, 3, 4, 5, and 18 years, respectively. In our existing reactive approach, there is a fundamental and inevitable delay before we can react; and thus, infections are destined to occur. The continued emergence or reemergence of transfusion-transmitted infections calls for a new paradigm of preemptive pathogen reduction (PR). Two PR systems, psoralen/UV-A and riboflavin/UV-A, have shown efficacy and safety for platelets and plasma; and psoralen/UV-A technology has been successfully implemented for platelets in Europe. Pathogen reduction can eliminate or reduce the risk for any nucleic acid containing agent, including bacteria, and thus will be effective for all but prion diseases. It is possible to introduce PR for platelets and plasma now and to concentrate resources on developing PR for red cells.

Rhinoviruses (RVs), respiratory enteroviruses (EVs), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), and coronaviruses are highly prevalent respiratory pathogens, but because of the lack of reliable animal models, their differential pathogenesis remains poorly characterized. Objective We sought to compare infections by respiratory viruses isolated from clinical specimens using reconstituted human airway epithelia. Methods Tissues were infected with RV-A55, RV-A49, RV-B48, RV-C8, and RV-C15; respiratory EV-D68; influenza virus H3N2; RSV-B; and human coronavirus (HCoV)\u2013OC43. Replication kinetics, cell tropism, effect on tissue integrity, and cytokine secretion were compared. Viral adaptation and tissue response were assessed through RNA sequencing. Results RVs, RSV-B, and HCoV-OC43 infected ciliated cells and caused no major cell death, whereas H3N2 and EV-D68 induced ciliated cell loss and tissue integrity disruption. H3N2 was also detected in rare goblet and basal cells. All viruses, except RV-B48 and HCoV-OC43, altered cilia beating and mucociliary clearance. H3N2 was the strongest cytokine inducer, and HCoV-OC43 was the weakest. Persistent infection was observed in all cases. RNA sequencing highlighted perturbation of tissue metabolism and induction of a transient but important immune response at 4 days after infection. No majority mutations emerged in the viral population. Conclusion Our results highlight the differential in vitro pathogenesis of respiratory viruses during the acute infection phase and their ability to persist under immune tolerance. These data help to appreciate the range of disease severity observed in vivo and the occurrence of chronic respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts.","publish_time":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Essaidi-Laziosi, Manel; Brito, Francisco; Benaoudia, Sacha; Royston, L\u00E9na; Cagno, Valeria; Fernandes-Rocha, M\u00E9lanie; Piuz, Isabelle; Zdobnov, Evgeny; Huang, Song; Constant, Samuel; Boldi, Marc-Olivier; Kaiser, Laurent; Tapparel, Caroline","journal":"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a6539f3981f802484c62ce1a7d1984f53dad8c8c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112338.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2017.07.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674917312745; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674917312745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28797733/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjszOTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathogenesis of respiratory viruses","respiratory syncytial viruses","respiratory enteroviruses","respiratory EV-D68","RV-B48","RV-A49","RV-C15","RV-A55","RV-C8","prevalent respiratory pathogens","tissue response","HCoV-OC43 infected ciliated cells","influenza virus H3N2","occurrence of chronic respiratory tract infections","tissue integrity disruption","ciliated cell loss","cell tropism","RSV-B","differential pathogenesis","acute infection phase","Results RVs","Persistent infection","RNA sequencing","highlighted perturbation of tissue metabolism","major cell death","important immune response","human coronavirus","basal cells","leading cause of acute illnesses","cytokine secretion","immune tolerance","viral population","Viral adaptation","strongest cytokine inducer","reconstituted human airway epithelia","clinical specimens","induction","effect","EVs","altered cilia","severe complications","lack of reliable animal models","ability","immunocompromised hosts","coronaviruses","self-limited diseases","RSVs","Replication kinetics","rare goblet","days","range of disease severity","mucociliary clearance","fragile patients","majority mutations","Rhinoviruses","data help","Methods Tissues","cases","Conclusion","weakest","Objective"],"language":"en"},

Reporter assay and Northern blot analysis revealed that trans-expression of NS proteins from 3 to 5 resulted in high level of luciferase activity and synthesized minus-strand RNA.

In times of an infectious epidemic where medical subspecialties lead the frontline, a surgeon\u2019s role becomes rather vague. However, the only obstacle that stands in between the surgeon and fighting in the frontline of an infectious disease outbreak, is the traditional perception of what a surgeon can do. By presenting the strategies employed by our institution and its surgical unit, which remains the epicenter of the COVID-19 fight in Singapore, together with our medical counterparts, we hope to be able to improve our practices to respond and prevent the pandemic from escalating further as a collective community of surgeons across the globe. Observations Contingencies should be in place for prioritization of existing patients, triaging and treatment of suspected patients, infection control, manpower management and novel strategies for inter-disciplinary communications and education in a hospital\u2019s surgical unit during a pandemic. Working in a high risk environment with manpower and resource limitations for prolonged periods of time has effect on morale and affects surgeon burn-out. Transparent communication, avenues to address psychological needs of surgeons and leadership by example are key strategies in ensuring a sustainable fight against the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance: With the varies strategies implemented, every surgical discipline and every surgeon to work together and place their desire to operate aside. There should not be any differentiation between surgeon and physician, but instead, everyone has to work together as one united health care front battling the common enemy \u2013 COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rasappan, Kumaran; Leong Oh, Jacob Yoong; Keong Ding, Benjamin Tze; Bin Mohd Fadhil, Muhd Farhan; Lee, Keng Thiam","journal":"International journal of surgery","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/492362249d1afcd685b4268e13aa3b23c41e56a2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.05.033; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919120304167?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426020/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1743919120304167","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Singapore","China"],"keyphrases":["pandemic","COVID","novel strategies","key strategies","frontline","hospital\u2019s surgical unit","Singapore","surgical discipline","place","manpower management","infectious epidemic","medical subspecialties","sustainable fight","medical counterparts","treatment of suspected patients","psychological needs of surgeons","prioritization of existing patients","infectious disease outbreak","collective community of surgeons","resource limitations","infection control","inter-disciplinary communications","education","prolonged periods of time","leadership","intra-hospital transmissions","avenues","little mortality","effect","example","high risk environment","common enemy","traditional perception","morale","epicenter","united health care","major lockdown","Transparent communication","surgeon\u2019s role","globe","successful containment","times","institution","Observations Contingencies","months","reported case","country","nations","Abstract Importance","countries","China","Relevance","practices","differentiation","physician","Conclusions","obstacle","desire"],"language":"en"},

Its role in acute asthma remains to be studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Feno levels are elevated in children with asthma exacerbations compared with baseline, and whether there is a difference in Feno levels based on PCR positive (\u002B) (respiratory virus isolated by PCR analysis) versus PCR negative (\u2212) (respiratory virus not isolated by PCR analysis) status. METHODS: Children with a previous Feno level measurement while stable and who presented to an urgent care facility with an asthma exacerbation were enrolled. Feno levels, spirometry, and nasal swabs for viral PCR were obtained at the time of the exacerbation and following a course of prednisone. Data were available on 66 children. Linear mixed models were used to regress the outcomes of interest (FEV(1), FEV(1)/forced vital capacity, forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of forced vital capacity, and natural log Feno) on detected virus (yes/no), visit (baseline, exacerbation, follow-up), and the interaction between the detected virus and visit. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, higher Feno values and lower lung function were found at the time of an exacerbation. A respiratory virus was detected in 59% of the exacerbations. The interaction between PCR (\u002B) and PCR (\u2212) groups and visit on log Feno was marginally significant (P = .07). There was no difference in log Feno between the PCR (\u002B) and PCR (\u2212) groups at baseline, while higher log Feno was found in the PCR (\u2212) group at the time of exacerbation and following prednisone (P = .05 and .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Higher Feno concentration in PCR (\u2212) exacerbations suggests an eosinophilic predominance in nonviral compared with viral exacerbations.","publish_time":"2015-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Malka, Jonathan; Covar, Ronina; Faino, Anna; Fish, Jennifer; Pickering, Paige; Ramamoorthy, Preveen; Gleason, Melanie; Spahn, Joseph D.","journal":"J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/da2662c4819deaa42fc36c7aeadeb3aff0dcc769.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7104006.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213219815002743; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213219815002743; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2015.05.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26216254/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUxLmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1707399,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:40Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"hNss7C4/ACHHyzwVjnJyAw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_51.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","Linear"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Feno levels","viral PCR","PCR analysis","higher log Feno","PCR negative","PCR positive","natural log Feno","higher Feno values","Higher Feno concentration","baseline","respiratory virus","asthma exacerbations","time of exacerbation","detected virus","previous Feno level measurement","children","viral exacerbations","visit","acute asthma","vital capacity","management of chronic asthma","groups","difference","interaction","FEV","course of prednisone","lower lung function","Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide","nasal swabs","nonviral","spirometry","urgent care facility","eosinophilic predominance","BACKGROUND","diagnosis","follow-up","CONCLUSIONS","aid","expiratory flow","METHODS","Linear mixed models","outcomes","Data","role","RESULTS","status","OBJECTIVE"],"language":"en"},

Bats are reservoirs for emerging human pathogens, including Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses and Ebola and Marburg filoviruses. These viruses demonstrate predictable patterns in seasonality and age structure across multiple systems; previous work suggests that they may circulate in Madagascar\u2019s endemic fruit bats, which are widely consumed as human food. 2. We aimed to (a) document the extent of henipa- and filovirus exposure among Malagasy fruit bats, (b) explore seasonality in seroprevalence and serostatus in these bat populations and (c) compare mechanistic hypotheses for possible transmission dynamics underlying these data. 3. To this end, we amassed and analysed a unique dataset documenting longitudinal serological henipa-and filovirus dynamics in three Madagascar fruit bat species. 4. We uncovered serological evidence of exposure to Hendra-/Nipah-related henipaviruses in Eidolon dupreanum, Pteropus rufus and Rousettus madagascariensis, to Cedar-related henipaviruses in E. dupreanum and R. madagascariensis and to Ebola-related filoviruses in P. rufus and R. madagascariensis. We demonstrated significant seasonality in population-level seroprevalence and individual serostatus for multiple viruses across these species, linked to the female reproductive calendar. An age-structured subset of the data highlighted evidence of waning maternal antibodies in neonates, increasing seroprevalence in young and decreasing seroprevalence late in life. Comparison of mechanistic epidemiological models fit to these data offered support for transmission hypotheses permitting waning antibodies but retained immunity in adult-age bats. 5. Our findings suggest that bats may seasonally modulate mechanisms of pathogen control, with consequences for population-level transmission. Additionally, we narrow the field of candidate transmission hypotheses by which bats are presumed to host and transmit potentially zoonotic viruses globally.","publish_time":"2019-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Brook, Cara E.; Ranaivoson, Hafaliana C.; Broder, Christopher C.; Cunningham, Andrew A.; H\u00E9raud, Jean-Michel; Peel, Alison J.; Gibson, Louise; Wood, James L.

The coinage indicates that the spread of infectious disease transforms the spatial coordinates of the modern political environment. This article analyses this transformation by asking how the legal regime, designed to prepare for the pandemic, envisions the globe as an object of government. It demonstrates that the WHO\u2019s International Health Regulations (IHR) articulate a space of global circulation that exhibits two features. First, the infrastructures of microbial traffic become the primary matters of concern. The IHR do not focus on human life so much as they aim at securing transnational mobilities. Second, the IHR circumscribe a space that is fragmented by zones of intensified governmental control at transportational nodal points, such as airports and harbours.

Community pharmacists have an important role in supporting the local health emergency preparedness and response arrangements. OBJECTIVES: To investigate pharmacists and pharmacy students\u2019 awareness and source of their information regard the management of the coronavirus pandemic, and their perspective of their role during this emergent situation. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak (from 15 to 30 March 2020). A validated online questionnaire addressing participants\u0027 current awareness about epidemics/pandemics and COVID-19, source of information and their perspectives of their role. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS). RESULTS: Participants (n = 726) had a mean age of 26.9 (8.0) years with 71.9% females. Pharmacy students made 35.3% of the sample while the rest were pharmacists. Only 54.3% of participants believed that they got enough education about epidemics/pandemics, and 94.6% of them follow on the latest coronavirus updates on treatments, and that is mainly from the media (59.5%) followed by the World Health Organization reports (58.7%) and then the published researches (57%). Awareness score (out of 20) of pharmacists (n = 470) was significantly higher (p \u003C 0.001) than that of students (n = 256). Better Awareness scores were also associated with higher age of participants, graduating from a public versus a private university, and attending more educational workshops. CONCLUSION: The majority of pharmacists and pharmacy students reported that they have a major role in the management of epidemics/pandemics through the community pharmacies but the majority follow on the latest coronavirus updates from the media. This fact rings bills considering the numerous conflicting messages publicized during the pandemic through the media.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basheti, Iman A.; Nassar, Razan; Barakat, Muna; Alqudah, Rajaa; Abufarha, Rana; Mukattash, Tareq L.; Saini, Bandana","journal":"Res Social Adm Pharm","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c700541878caab6db1da8743bc579373e3111f7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7194707.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32360181/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551741120304186; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551741120304186","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxMDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Health Organization"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["coronavirus pandemic","majority of pharmacists","Community pharmacists","pandemics","latest coronavirus updates","Coronavirus infection","COVID","media","pharmacy students\u2019 awareness","management of epidemics","important role","major role","novel strain of coronavirus","higher age of participants","participants\u0027 current awareness","source of information","majority follow","Better Awareness scores","public health emergency of international concern","local health emergency preparedness","community pharmacies","World Health Organization reports","mean age","validated online questionnaire","descriptive cross-sectional online survey study","numerous conflicting messages","statistical package","Jordan","response arrangements","fact rings bills","social science","SPSS","METHODS","private university","sample","perspectives","treatments","educational workshops","emergent situation","Data","years","outbreak","China","rest","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","OBJECTIVES","published researches","females"],"language":"en"},

Phylogenetic analysis revealed one novel clade A strain, the first detected in the UAE, and nine clade B strains.

A comparison of predicted protein sequences also demonstrated the existence of two clade A lineages with unique amino acid substitutions, A1 (EMC/2012 and Jordan-N3/2012) and A2 (D998/15 and NRCE-HKU205), circulating in humans and camels, respectively. The nine clade B isolates belong to three distinct lineages: B1, B3 and B5. Two B3 strains, D1271/15 and D1189.1/15, showed evidence of recombination between lineages B4 and B5 in ORF1ab. Molecular clock analysis dated the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of clade A to March 2011 and that of clade B to November 2011.

However, little is known about the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of field strains of PED virus (PEDV) in China in 2016\u20132017. To address this issue, in this study, 116 diarrhea samples were collected from pig farms in 6 Chinese provinces in 2016\u20132017 and were detected using PCR for main porcine enteric pathogens, including PEDV, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine kobuvirus (PKV). In addition, the complete S genes from 11 representative PEDV strains were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: PCR detection showed that 52.6% (61/116) of these samples were positive for PEDV. Furthermore, sequencing results for the spike (S) genes from 11 of the epidemic PEDV strains showed 93\u201394% nucleotide identity and 92\u201393% amino acid identity with the classical CV777 strain. Compared with the CV777 vaccine strain, these strains had an insertion (A(133)), a deletion (G(155)), and a continuous 4-amino-acid insertion ((56)NNTN(59)) in the S1 region. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene indicated that the 11 assessed PEDV strains were genetically diverse and clustered into the G2 group. These results demonstrate that the epidemic strains of PEDV in China in 2016\u20132017 are mainly virulent strains that belong to the G2 group and genetically differ from the vaccine strain. Importantly, this is the first report that the samples collected in Hainan Province were positive for PEDV (59.2%, 25/42). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this article presents the first report of a virulent PEDV strain isolated from Hainan Island, China. The results of this study will contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of PEDV in China.","publish_time":"2017-10-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Qiaoling; Liu, Xinsheng; Fang, Yuzhen; Zhou, Peng; Wang, Yonglu; Zhang, Yongguang","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82e600f01e9caa5ae2c03497d8454e5d10e87369.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5634871.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29017599/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0860-z","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxNTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PCR","PEDV"],"locations":["China","Hainan Island"],"keyphrases":["epidemic PEDV strains","epidemic strains of PEDV","assessed PEDV strains","representative PEDV strains","virulent PEDV strain","China","virulent strains","genetic characteristics of PEDV","porcine deltacoronavirus","porcine kobuvirus","CV777 vaccine strain","molecular epidemiology of field strains of PED virus","diarrhea samples","sequencing results","Large-scale outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea","classical CV777 strain","porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus","main porcine enteric pathogens","complete S genes","amino acid identity","amino-acid insertion","G2 group","report","study","Hainan Island","genetic diversity","Hainan Province","nucleotide identity","PCR detection","TGEV","PDCoV","pig farms","understanding","BACKGROUND","spike","Chinese provinces","Phylogenetic analysis","PKV","addition","knowledge","article","NNTN","recent years","deletion","S1 region","CONCLUSIONS","issue"],"language":"en"},

To this end there have been great efforts to train an additional 300 000 GPs by 2020. This paper examines the perspective of practitioners in Henan, China, regarding general practice. DESIGN: A mixed-methods approach using focus group discussions (FGD), and structured questionnaires. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Seven FGDs and responses to 1887 questionnaires included medical students, primary care doctors and GP residents in Henan. RESULTS: The three surveyed medical groups have some awareness of the attributes of general practice (eg, comprehensiveness, first contact and coordination), but often misinterpret what being a GP entails. Five themes were identified through the FGDs and tested quantitatively for their prevalence with structured questionnaires. First, the GPs\u2019 role as a comprehensive care provider was (mis)interpreted as an \u2018all-round doctor\u2019. Second, the GP\u2019s responsibility as the first point of care was understood in two conflicting ways: private personal doctors of the rich and the powerful or village doctors for common people. Third, referral was understood as simply guiding patients to appropriate departments within the hospital while the gatekeeping role was interpreted to involve GPs being peoples\u2019 health protectors rather than being also gatekeepers of specialty services. Traditional Chinese medicine now further complicates the understanding of GPs. And lastly, the GPs\u2019 main responsibility was considered to be public health work. CONCLUSION: The misunderstandings of the roles and responsibilities of GPs render problematic the policy foundation of China\u2019s GP-centred primary care system. Pursuing the quantity of GPs on its own is meaningless, since the number needed depends on the delineated role of GPs. Top priority is to establish clarity about the GP role, which requires reforming the health delivery system to address issues with fragmented care, strategically taking into account the development of GPs with work delegation and substitution and providing more clarity on the distinction between general practice and public health.","publish_time":"2020-02-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Jiming; Ariana, Proochista","journal":"BMJ Open","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b1db58b45ac9db3de3c103db7e9de544c6c3eea.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ff2461416a15e35f6befb112accdc1301f5a7724.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7044834.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32019820/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036240","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["GP role","primary care doctors","responsibilities of GPs","development of GPs","understanding of GPs","delineated role of GPs","quantity of GPs","fragmented care","point of care","GP residents","GP entails","GPs\u2019 role","policy foundation of China\u2019s GP-centred primary care system","comprehensive care provider","health delivery system","attributes of general practice","public health work","general practitioner","gatekeeping role","structured questionnaires","village doctors","Henan","clarity","peoples\u2019 health protectors","FGDs","private personal doctors","GPs\u2019 main responsibility","medical students","work delegation","GP\u2019s responsibility","surveyed medical groups","China\u2019s central government","mixed-methods approach","focus group discussions","awareness","hospital","roles","responses","conflicting ways","account","issues","distinction","patients","perspective of practitioners","common people","comprehensiveness","substitution","appropriate departments","great efforts","misunderstandings","DESIGN","PARTICIPANTS","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","number","prevalence","Traditional Chinese medicine","gatekeepers of specialty services","contact","coordination","end","paper","CONCLUSION","SETTING","all-round doctor","referral","themes","priority"],"language":"en"},

Though existence of a universal reference gene is myth, commonly used reference genes can be assessed for expression stability to confer their suitability to be used as candidate reference genes in gene expression studies. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of ten most commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, HSP90, HMBS, 18S rRNA, B2M, POLR2A, HPRT1, ACAC, YWHAZ) in fourteen different Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) infected tissues of goats and sheep. RefFinder and RankAggreg software were used to deduce comprehensive ranking of reference genes. Our results suggested HMBS and B2M in goats and HMBS and HPRT1 in sheep can be used as suitable endogenous controls in gene expression studies of PPRV infection irrespective of tissues and condition as a whole, thus eliminating the use of tissue specific/ condition specific endogenous controls. We report for the first time suitable reference genes for gene expression studies in PPRV infected tissues. The reference genes determined here can be useful for future studies on gene expression in sheep and goat infected with PPRV, thus saving extra efforts and time of repeating the reference gene determination and validation.","publish_time":"2018-10-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sahu, Amit Ranjan; Wani, Sajad Ahmad; Saxena, Shikha; Rajak, Kaushal Kishor; Chaudhary, Dheeraj; Sahoo, Aditya Prasad; Khanduri, Alok; Pandey, Aruna; Mondal, Piyali; Malla, Waseem Akram; Khan, Raja Ishaq Nabi; Tiwari, Ashok Kumar; Mishra, Bina; Muthuchelvan, D.; Mishra, Bishnu Prasad; Singh, Raj Kumar; Gandham, Ravi Kumar","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4090dff0fba51422afb6bf34f29c10f9a35caac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6206032.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30374051/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34236-7","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjsxOTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA","PPRV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["used reference genes","universal reference gene","reference gene determination","time suitable reference genes","gene expression data","gene expression studies of PPRV infection","expression stability","comprehensive ranking of reference genes","Identification of suitable candidate reference genes","PPRV infected tissues","HMBS","sheep","infected tissues of goats","future studies","suitable endogenous controls","B2M","condition specific endogenous controls","HPRT1","quantitative real time PCR","qRT-PCR","use of tissue specific","downstream analysis of RNA sequencing","petits ruminants virus","important prerequisite","different Peste","POLR2A","HSP90","GAPDH","ACTB","myth","S rRNA","YWHAZ","ACAC","suitability","RankAggreg software","extra efforts","results","existence","validation","RefFinder","study"],"language":"en"},

Two viruses with negative- and positive-sense RNA genome were used: measles (MV) and chikungunya (CHIKV).

One such class of peptides is temporins. Temporins are the smallest (AMPs) found in nature and are highly active against gram-positive bacteria. Nowadays, there was a rapid increase in the availability of the 3D structure of proteins in PDB (protein data bank). The conserved residues and 3D structural conformations of temporins (AMPs) were still unknown. The present study explores the sequence analysis, alpha-helical structural conformations of temporins. The sequence of temporins was deracinated from APD3 database, the three-dimensional structure was constructed by homology modeling studies. The sequence analysis results show that the conserved residues among the peptide sequences, the maximum of the sequences are 70% alike to each other. The secondary structure prediction results revealed that 99% of temporin (AMPs) exhibited in alpha-helical form. The 3D structure speculated using RAMPAGE exposes the alpha-helical conformation in all temporins (AMPs). The phylogenetic analysis reveals the evolutionary relationships of temporins (AMPs), which are branched into seven clusters. As a result, we identified a list of potential temporin AMPs which docked to the antiviral protein (MERS-CoV), it shows good protein-peptide binding.

In addition, a total of 100 field samples from ileum, ileum-cecal junction, and ceca, collected from 30 to 45-d-old turkeys poults experiencing an outbreak of acute enteritis, were used to search for TCoV by the same D-IHC. All results were compared with those obtained by conventional RT-PCR and indirect fluorescent antibody assay (IFA) for all tested samples. Turkey coronavirus was detected in experimentally infected embryo tissues and also in field samples in 100% of ileum-cecal junction and ceca by the 3 detection procedures. With IFA as a reference assay, sensitivity and specificity of D-IHC were 98 and 58%, whereas sensitivity and specificity of reverse transcription-PCR were 96 and 66%, calculated from the total of tested samples from experimental infection. Each of the examined procedures was highly specific (D-IHC, 93%; RT-PCR, 90%), sensitive (D-IHC, 85%; RT-PCR, 86%), and agreement of both D-IHC and RT-PCR was 99 and 100%, respectively, compared with IFA results obtained from all the field samples. These findings demonstrated the utility of D-IHC for direct detection of TCoV from field samples and considering the sensitivity and specificity found here, can be used as an alternative technique.","publish_time":"2008-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cardoso, T.

Sand flies are vectors of leishmaniasis, but can also transmit viruses. We have been studying immune responses of Lutzomyia longipalpis, the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas. We identified a non-specific antiviral response in L. longipalpis LL5 embryonic cells when treated with non-specific double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). This response is reminiscent of interferon response in mammals. We are investigating putative effectors for this antiviral response. Secreted molecules have been implicated in immune responses, including interferon-related responses. We conducted a mass spectrometry analysis of conditioned medium from LL5 cells 24 and 48 h after dsRNA or mock treatment. We identified 304 proteins. At 24 h, 19 proteins had an abundance equal or greater than 2-fold change, while the levels of 17 proteins were reduced when compared to control cells. At the 48 h time point, these numbers were 33 and 71, respectively. The two most abundant secreted peptides at 24 h in the dsRNA-transfected group were phospholipid scramblase, an interferon-inducible protein that mediates antiviral activity, and forskolin-binding protein (FKBP), a member of the immunophilin family, which mediates the effect of immunosuppressive drugs. The transcription profile of most candidates did not follow the pattern of secreted protein abundance.","publish_time":"2018-01-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martins-da-Silva, Andrea; Telleria, Erich Loza; Batista, Michel; Marchini, Fabricio Klerynton; Traub-Csek\u00F6, Yara Maria; Tempone, Antonio Jorge","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09cba4ea15eda3c3bd33243487c9bd32928d9635.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5795456.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v10010043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29346269/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-specific antiviral response","proteins","reminiscent of interferon response","LL5 cells","interferon-inducible protein","interferon-related responses","pattern of secreted protein abundance","longipalpis LL5 embryonic cells","antiviral activity","immune responses of Lutzomyia longipalpis","control cells","h time point","Secreted molecules","forskolin-binding protein","abundant secreted peptides","abundance equal","dsRNA-transfected group","non-specific double-stranded RNAs","main vector of visceral leishmaniasis","phospholipid scramblase","mass spectrometry analysis of conditioned medium","dsRNAs","member","FKBP","fold change","Hematophagous insects","infectious diseases","candidates","immunophilin family","Americas","levels","numbers","mock treatment","putative effectors","mammals","effect of immunosuppressive drugs","transcription profile","Sand flies","viruses"],"language":"en"},

Due to specific arrangements of genes along the TBEV genome, its viral-like particles (VLPs) could be exploited as shuttles to deliver their replicon, which carries therapeutic genes, to immune system cells. OBJECTIVE: To develop a flaviviral vector for gene delivery as a part of gene therapy research that can be expressed in secretable VLP suicidal shuttles and provide abundant unique molecular and structural data supporting this gene therapy concept. METHOD: TBEV structural gene constructs of a Swedish Tor\u00F6 strain were cloned into plasmids driven by the promoters CAG and CMV and then transfected into various cell lines, including COS-1 and BHK-21. Time-course sampling of the cells, culture fluid, cell lysate supernatant, and pellet specimens were performed. Western blotting and electron microscopy analyses of collected specimens were used to investigate molecular and structural processing of TBEV structural proteins. RESULTS: Western blotting analysis showed differences between promoters in directing the gene expression of the VLPs constructs. The premature flaviviral polypeptides as well as mature VLPs could be traced. Using electron microscopy, the premature and mature VLP accumulation in cellular compartments\u2014and also endoplasmic reticulum proliferation as a virus factory platform\u2014were observed in addition to secreted VLPs. CONCLUSIONS: The abundant virologic and cellular findings in this study show the natural processing and safety of inserting flaviviral structural genes into suicidal VLP shuttles. Thus, we propose that these VLPs are a suitable gene delivering system model in gene therapy.","publish_time":"2017-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Neddermeyer, Anne H.; Hultenby, Kjell; Paidikondala, Maruthibabu; Schuchman, Ryan M.; Bidokhti, Mehdi R.M.","journal":"Curr Ther Res Clin Exp","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/14f66845d5028f06204e3bc528e14e7dddd5b341.json; document_parses/pdf_json/ab18d9ed3bc142234a26089ec9b4aeddfbc51e6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6076373.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011393X17300322; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.curtheres.2017.10.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30093925/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0011393X17300322","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUyLmNzdjszNDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1696690,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"EqxbhCxSqgBy1Utie8RA1g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_52.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBEV","CAG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["TBEV structural gene constructs","gene therapy research","suitable gene","gene delivery","gene expression","gene therapy concept","mature VLPs","VLPs constructs","structural processing of TBEV structural proteins","structural data","secreted VLPs","suicidal VLP shuttles","safety of inserting flaviviral structural genes","TBEV genome","secretable VLP suicidal shuttles","mature VLP accumulation","therapeutic genes","flaviviral vector","premature flaviviral polypeptides","immune system cells","Western blotting analysis","specific arrangements of genes","electron microscopy analyses","cellular compartments","cellular findings","abundant virologic","natural processing","system model","promoters CAG","pellet specimens","cell lysate supernatant","virus factory platform","various cell lines","biogenesis of tick-borne encephalitis virus","culture fluid","endoplasmic reticulum proliferation","study","differences","Swedish Tor\u00F6 strain","plasmids","COS","Time-course sampling","CMV","RESULTS","addition","METHOD","CONCLUSIONS","particles","replicon","BACKGROUND","OBJECTIVE","BHK"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we compared the genomes of outbreak associated non-outbreak causing Salmonella ser. Heidelberg strains from diverse hosts and geographical regions. Human outbreak associated strains in this study were from a 2015 multistate outbreak of Salmonella ser. Heidelberg involving 15 states in the United States which originated from bull calves. Our clinicopathologic examination revealed that cases involving Salmonella ser. Heidelberg strains were predominantly young, less than weeks-old, dairy calves. Pre-existing or concurrent disease was found in the majority of the calves. Detection of Salmonella ser. Heidelberg correlated with markedly increased death losses clinically comparable to those seen in herds infected with S. Dublin, a known serious pathogen of cattle. Whole genome based single nucleotide polymorphism based analysis revealed that these calf isolates formed a distinct cluster along with outbreak associated human isolates. The defining feature of the outbreak associated strains, when compared to older isolates of S. Heidelberg, is that all isolates in this cluster contained Saf fimbrial genes which are generally absent in S. Heidelberg. The acquisition of several single nucleotide polymorphisms and the gain of Saf fimbrial genes may have contributed to the increased disease severity of these Salmonella ser. Heidelberg strains.

Functionalized magnetic nanoparticles might concentrate traces of target microorganisms from sample solutions. Therefore, nanoparticle\u2010based techniques have a favorable detection limit. MS coupled with various chromatographic techniques, such as liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis, reduces the complexity of microbial biomarkers and yields reliable results. The direct analysis of whole pathogenic microbial cells with matrix\u2010assisted laser desorption/ionization MS without sample separation reveals specific biomarkers for taxonomy, and has the advantages of simplicity, rapidity, and high\u2010throughput measurements.

METHODS: Our analysis was based on 2006 adult patients admitted to 54 ICUs between 2014 and 2018, enrolled in the CENTER-TBI study. Indicator scores were calculated as percentage adherence for structure and process indicators and as event rates or median scores for outcome indicators. Feasibility was quantified by the completeness of the variables. Discriminability was determined by the between-centre variation, estimated with a random effect regression model adjusted for case-mix severity and quantified by the median odds ratio (MOR). Statistical uncertainty of outcome indicators was determined by the median number of events per centre, using a cut-off of 10. RESULTS: A total of 26/42 indicators could be calculated from the CENTER-TBI database. Most quality indicators proved feasible to obtain with more than 70% completeness. Sub-optimal adherence was found for most quality indicators, ranging from 26 to 93% and 20 to 99% for structure and process indicators. Significant (p \u003C 0.001) between-centre variation was found in seven process and five outcome indicators with MORs ranging from 1.51 to 4.14. Statistical uncertainty of outcome indicators was generally high; five out of seven had less than 10 events per centre. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, nine structures, five processes, but none of the outcome indicators showed potential for quality improvement purposes for TBI patients in the ICU. Future research should focus on implementation efforts and continuous reevaluation of quality indicators.

Recent advances have greatly increased the number of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies in flow cytometry. In particular, an increase in available fluorochromes with distinct excitation and emission spectra combined with novel multicolor flow cytometers with several lasers have enhanced the generation of multidimensional expression data for leukocytes and other cell types. However, these advances have mainly benefited the analysis of human or mouse cell samples given the lack of reagents for most animal species. The flow cytometric analysis of important veterinary, agricultural, wildlife, and other animal species is still hampered by several technical limitations, even though animal species other than the mouse can serve as more accurate models of specific human physiology and diseases. RESULTS: Here we present time-tested approaches that our laboratory regularly uses in the multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of ovine leukocytes. The discussed approaches will be applicable to the analysis of cells from most animal species and include direct modification of antibodies by covalent conjugation or Fc-directed labeling (Zenon\u2122 technology), labeled secondary antibodies and other second step reagents, labeled receptor ligands, and antibodies with species cross-reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Using refined technical approaches, the number of parameters analyzed by flow cytometry per cell sample can be greatly increased, enabling multidimensional analysis of rare samples and giving critical insight into veterinary and other less commonly analyzed species. By maximizing information from each cell sample, multicolor flow cytometry can reduce the required number of animals used in a study.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hunka, Julia; Riley, John T.; Debes, Gudrun F.","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1dd19c86629e145337db3f1c1a21d2b52a042ac5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7060616.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7060616/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzQ4Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["animal species","multicolor flow cytometry","analysis of human","flow cytometric analysis of important veterinary","analysis of cells","multiparameter flow cytometric analysis of ovine leukocytes","mouse cell samples","cell types","novel multicolor flow cytometers","multidimensional analysis of rare samples","species cross-reactivity","multiparameter analysis of leukocyte subsets","secondary antibodies","single cell level","direct modification of antibodies","number of parameters","number of fluorochrome","refined technical approaches","time-tested approaches","discussed approaches","required number of animals","lack of reagents","technical limitations","Recent advances","second step reagents","generation of multidimensional expression data","accurate models of specific human physiology","emission spectra","available fluorochromes","distinct excitation","receptor ligands","covalent conjugation","lasers","powerful tool","increase","Fc","wildlife","critical insight","Zenon","diseases","technology","laboratory","CONCLUSIONS","information","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","study"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The PARAMEDIC2 trial was undertaken across 5 NHS ambulance services in England and Wales with randomisation between December 2014 and October 2017. Patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were unresponsive to initial resuscitation attempts were randomly assigned to 1 mg intravenous adrenaline or matching placebo according to treatment packs that were identical apart from treatment number. Participants and study staff were masked to treatment allocation. RESULTS: 8016 patients were enrolled, 4902 sustained a witnessed cardiac arrest of whom 2437 received placebo and 2465 received adrenaline. The odds of return of spontaneous circulation decreased in both groups over time but at a greater rate in the placebo arm odds ratio (OR) 0.93 (95% CI 0.92\u20130.95) compared with the adrenaline arm OR 0.96 (95% CI 0.95\u20130.97); interaction OR: 1.03, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.05, p = 0.005. By contrast, although the rate of survival and favourable neurological outcome decreased as time to treatment increased, the rates did not differ between the adrenaline and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: The rate of return of spontaneous circulation, survival and favourable neurological outcomes decrease over time. As time to drug treatment increases, adrenaline increases the chances of return of spontaneous circulation. Longer term outcomes were not affected by the time to adrenaline administration.

The inhibition mechanism is triggered by introducing a short interference double-stranded RNA (siRNA,19~27 bp) into the cytoplasm, where the guide strand of siRNA (usually antisense strand) binds to its target messenger RNA and the expression of the target gene is blocked. RNAi has been widely applied in gene functional analysis, and as a potential therapeutic strategy in viral diseases, drug target discovery, and cancer therapy. Among the factors which may compromise inhibition efficiency, how to design siRNAs with high efficiency and high specificity to its target gene is critical.

It has been hypothesized that some features of their innate immune system may enable bats to trigger an efficient early immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a first line defense within the innate immune system and lie directly at the host\u2013pathogen interface in targeting specific microbe-molecular patterns. However, the direction and strength of selection acting on TLRs are largely unknown for bats. Here, we studied the selection on viral ssRNA sensing TLR8 based on sequence data of 21 bat species. The major part (63 %) of the TLR8 gene evolved under purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints. We also found evidence for persistent positive selection acting on specific amino acid sites (7 %), especially when compared to viral TLR evolution of other mammals. All of these putatively positively selected codons were located in the ligand-binding ectodomain, some coincidenced or were in close proximity to functional sites, as suggested by the crystallographic structure of the human TLR8. This might contribute to the inter-species variation in the ability to recognize molecular patterns of viruses. TLR8 evolution within bats revealed that branches leading to ancestral and recent lineages evolved under episodic positive selection, indicating selective selection pressures in restricted bat lineages. Altogether, we found that the TLR8 displays extensive sequence variation within bats and that unique features separate them from humans and other mammals.

The main result of the paper is the illustration of the link between graph automorphisms and the process of lumping whereby the number of equations in a system of linear differential equations can be significantly reduced. The main advantage of lumping is that the simplified lumped system is not an approximation of the original system but rather an exact version of this.

Here, we review important evolutionary aspects of HIV infection, highlighting the concept of selection at multiple spatial and temporal scales. At the smallest scale, a single cell may be infected by multiple virions competing for intracellular resources. Recombination and phenotypic mixing introduce novel evolutionary dynamics. As the virus spreads between cells in an infected individual, it continually evolves to circumvent the immune system. We discuss evolutionary mechanisms of HIV pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Viral spread throughout the human population can lead to changes in virulence and the transmission of immune-evading variation. HIV emerged as a human pathogen due to selection occurring between different species, adapting from related viruses of primates. HIV also evolves resistance to antiretroviral drugs within a single infected host, and we explore the possibility for the spread of these strains between hosts, leading to a drug-resistant epidemic. We investigate the role of latency, drug-protected compartments, and direct cell-to-cell transmission on viral evolution. The introduction of an HIV vaccine may select for viral variants that escape vaccine control, both within an individual and throughout the population. Due to the strong selective pressure exerted by HIV-induced morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world, the human population itself may be co-evolving in response to the HIV pandemic. Throughout the paper, we focus on trade-offs between costs and benefits that constrain viral evolution and accentuate how selection pressures differ at different levels of selection.

The 2018 Pain, Agitation/sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep disruption guideline suggested low-dose ketamine infusion as an adjunct to opioid therapy to reduce opioid requirements in post-surgical patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This was, however, rated as conditional due to the very low quality of evidence. Ketamine has favorable characteristics, making it an especially viable alternative for patients with respiratory and hemodynamic instability. The Analgo-sedative adjuncT keTAmine Infusion iN Mechanically vENTilated ICU patients (ATTAINMENT) trial aims to assess the effect and safety of adjunct low-dose continuous infusion of ketamine as an analgo-sedative compared to standard of care in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) for \u2265 24 h. METHODS/DESIGN: This trial is a prospective, randomized, active controlled, open-label, pilot, feasibility study of adult ICU patients (\u003E 14 years old) on MV. The study will take place in the adult ICUs in the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH\u0026RC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and will enroll 80 patients. Patients will be randomized post-intubation into two groups: the intervention group will receive an adjunct low-dose continuous infusion of ketamine plus standard of care. Ketamine will be administered over a period of 48 h at a fixed infusion rate of 2 \u03BCg/kg/min (0.12 mg/kg/h) in the first 24 h followed by 1 \u03BCg/kg/min (0.06 mg/kg/h) in the second 24 h. The control group will receive standard of care in the ICU (propofol and/or fentanyl and/or midazolam) according to the KFSH\u0026RC sedation and analgesia protocol as clinically appropriate. The primary outcome is MV duration until ICU discharge, death, extubation, or 28 days post-randomization, whichever comes first. DISCUSSION: The first patient was enrolled on 1 September 2019. As of 10 October 2019, a total of 16 patients had been enrolled. We expect to complete the recruitment by 31 December 2020. The findings of this pilot trial will likely justify further investigation for the role of adjunct low-dose ketamine infusion as an analgo-sedative agent in a larger, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.

In the present study, progressively deleted lengths of the 5\u2032 noncoding region of segment A were constructed in pGL3 vectors having SV40 enhancer or promoter, and a luciferase (LUC) reporter gene. Transient transfections of the constructs made in a promoter-less pGL3-Enhancer vector when transfected in Vero cells and the lysates assayed for LUC expression, allowed the localization of maximal activity to the 32-nucleotide stretch (precursor polyprotein ORF positions \u2212131 to \u2212100), which is highly conserved at the 5\u2032 end of both genome segments. This fragment, when evaluated in parallel in an enhancer-less pGL3-Promoter vector demonstrated no activity. To determine if this region is recognized by IBDV replicative proteins, we engineered modifications in an enhancer-less pGL3-Promoter vector where the terminal 32-bp fragment, the full-length noncoding region, or the noncodig region with the 32-bp fragment deleted was positioned in either the plus-sense or the minus-sense orientation immediately downstream of the SV40 promoter and upstream of the LUC gene. Transfections of these constructs in IBDV-infected and uninfected Vero cells resulted in the endogenous generation of recombinant viral-LUC RNAs containing the 5\u2032 terminal viral RNA sequences in either the plus-sense or the minus-sense orientation. LUC assays of the infected cell lysates showed up-regulated expression of LUC only with constructs containing the 32-bp fragment in the minus-sense orientation. Deletion of this 32-bp fragment abolished such LUC expression. We therefore conclude that the 5\u2032-terminal 32 base pairs of genomic segment A contain a major promoter element in IBDV. In addition, our results show that IBDV replicative proteins recognize and transcribe single-stranded RNA in vivo.","publish_time":"2014-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nagarajan, M. M.; Kibenge, F. S.

In this study, the completed genome sequence of MPRV was determined, and the complete genome sequence of PoRV was assembled from previously published protein-coding genes and the non-coding genome regions determined from this study. Comparison of sequence and genome organization indicated that PoRV is more closely related to MPRV than to any other members of the genus Rubulavirus. In the P gene coding region of both viruses, there is an ORF located at the 5\u2032 end of the P gene overlapping with the P protein coding region, similar to the C protein ORF present in most viruses of the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, but absent in other known rubulaviruses.

First, we blasted the whole SARS-CoV genome against a virus database to search viruses of interest. Second, we employed 7 recombination detection techniques well documented in successfully detecting recombination events to explore the presence of recombination in SARS-CoV genome. Finally, we conducted phylogenetic analyses to further explore whether recombination has indeed occurred in the course of coronaviruses history predating the emergence of SARS-CoV. Surprisingly, we found that 7 putative recombination regions, located in Replicase 1ab and Spike protein, exist between SARS-CoV and other 6 coronaviruses: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), and avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).

Attention has often focused on wild animal reservoirs, but most zoonotic pathogens of recent concern to human health either originate in, or are transferred to, human populations from domesticated animals raised for human consumption. Thus, the ecological context of emerging infectious disease comprises two overlapping ecosystems: the natural habitats and populations of wild animals, and the anthropogenically controlled habitats and populations of domesticated species. Intensive food animal production systems and their associated value chains dominate in developed countries and are increasingly important in developing countries. These systems are characterized by large numbers of animals being raised in confinement with high throughput and rapid turnover. Although not typically recognized as such, industrial food animal production generates unique ecosystems\u2014environments that may facilitate the evolution of zoonotic pathogens and their transmission to human populations. It is often assumed that confined food animal production reduces risks of emerging zoonotic diseases. This article provides evidence suggesting that these industrial systems may increase animal and public health risks unless there is recognition of the specific biosecurity and biocontainment challenges of the industrial model. Moreover, the economic drivers and constraints faced by the industry and its participants must be fully understood in order to inform preventative policy. In order to more effectively reduce zoonotic disease risk from industrial food animal production, private incentives for the implementation of biosecurity must align with public health interests.","publish_time":"2009-05-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leibler, Jessica H.; Otte, Joachim; Roland-Holst, David; Pfeiffer, Dirk U.; Soares Magalhaes, Ricardo; Rushton, Jonathan; Graham, Jay P.; Silbergeld, Ellen K.","journal":"Ecohealth","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fa511ef3a1199a444d5a69da5477521688cb510.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087879.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087879/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2OzkyNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["human populations","industrial food animal production","human health","confined food animal production","Intensive food animal production systems","industrial systems","populations of wild animals","wild animal reservoirs","risks of emerging zoonotic diseases","zoonotic origins","human consumption","zoonotic disease risk","evolution of zoonotic pathogens","populations of domesticated species","domesticated animals","industrial model","emerging infectious diseases","public health risks","zoonotic pathogens of recent concern","public health interests","order","ecological context of emerging infectious disease","large numbers of animals","overlapping ecosystems","unique ecosystems","natural habitats","implementation of biosecurity","specific biosecurity","developed countries","developing countries","anthropogenically controlled habitats","associated value chains","private incentives","confinement","recognition","biocontainment challenges","environments","transmission","high throughput","rapid turnover","constraints","industry","evidence","economic drivers","preventative policy","participants","article","Attention"],"language":"en"},

Recentstudies of the fusion of enveloped viruses with host cell membranes havehelped to define the fusion process. The identification and characterizationof key proteins involved in fusion reactions have mainly driven recent advancesin our understanding of membrane fusion. The most important denominator amongthe fusion proteins is the fusion peptide. In this review, work done in thelast few years on the molecular mechanism of viral membrane fusion will behighlighted, focusing in particular on the role of the fusion peptide and themodification of the lipid bilayer structure. Much of what is known regardingthe molecular mechanism of viral membrane fusion has been gained using liposomesas model systems in which the molecular components of the membrane and the environmentare strictly controlled. Many amphilphilic peptides have a high affinity forlipid bilayers, but only a few sequences are able to induce membrane fusion. Thepresence of \u03B1-helical structure in at least part of the fusion peptideis strongly correlated with activity whereas, \u03B2-structure tends to beless prevalent, associated with non-native experimental conditions, and morerelated to vesicle aggregation than fusion. The specific angle of insertionof the peptides into the membrane plane is also found to be an importantcharacteristic for the fusion process. A shallow penetration, extending onlyto the central aliphatic core region, is likely responsible for the destabilization ofthe lipids required for coalescence of the apposing membranes and fusion.","publish_time":"2000-12-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Martin, Isabelle; Ruysschaert, Jean-Marie","journal":"Biosci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7a42dabec620c6d9bf9133f5c40700a103d78146.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087982/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUuY3N2Ozk0NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1810162,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:03Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"LD2ov9\u002BoariZkyj1FK9e4A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_5.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["fusion process","lipidbilayer fusion","fusion peptideis","understanding of membrane fusion","intracellular fusion reactions","fusion of enveloped viruses","regardingthe molecular mechanism of viral membrane fusion","important denominator amongthe fusion proteins","membrane plane","molecular components","\u03B2-structure","helical structure","lipid bilayer structure","amphilphilic peptides","apposing membranes","characterizationof key proteins","host cell membranes","central aliphatic core region","onlyto","coalescence","themodification","recent advancesin","beless prevalent","destabilization ofthe lipids","high affinity forlipid bilayers","sequences","non-native experimental conditions","liposomesas model systems","role","years","activity","specific angle of insertionof","shallow penetration","vesicle aggregation","identification","Thepresence of \u03B1","Recentstudies","work","environmentare","importantcharacteristic","alleukaroytic cells","review"],"language":"en"},

In order to understand the cleavage mechanism, molecular modeling tools were utilized to study the coupled model systems of the proteases, i.e., trypsin and furin and peptides of the cleavage sites specific to H5N1 and H1 HAs, which constitute models of HA precursor in complex with cleavage proteases. The peptide segments \u2018RERRRKKR \u2193 G\u2019 and \u2018SIQSR \u2193 G\u2019 from the high pathogenic H5N1 H5 and the low pathogenic H1N1 H1 cleavage sites were docking to the trypsin and furin active pockets, respectively. It was observed through the docking studies that trypsin was able to recognize and cleave both the high pathogenic and low pathogenic hemagglutinin, while furin could only cleave the high pathogenic hemagglutinin. An analysis of binding energies indicated that furin got most of its selectivity due to the interactions with P(1), P(4), and P(6), while having less interaction with P(2) and little interactions with P(3), P(5), P(7), and P(8). Some mutations of H5N1 H5 cleavage sequence fitted less well into furin and would reduce high pathogenicity of the virus.

The biological role of p17 is fully unknown so far. Using trypan blue dye exclusion and MTT assay, we demonstrated that the ectopic expression of p17 results in the reduction of viable cell number and cell proliferation rate of Vero, BHK, 293, and HeLa cells. Measurement of LDH activity and DNA fragmentation analysis revealed that p17 expression did not cause cell death or apoptosis. These data indicated that the p17 possessed the growth retardation function. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting revealed that p17-expressing cells induced the expression of CDK inhibitor p21cip1/waf1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but the transcripts of CDK inhibitor p15INK4b, p16INK4a, or p27kip were not altered. In the presence of p17, the p53 protein level and p53-driven reporter activity were elevated significantly. Dominant negative p53 alleviated the p21 accumulation, p53 activation, and growth inhibition effect induced by p17.

As a result, an imbalance between high detection rate and low false alarm rate occurs. To solve this problem, this study proposes a novel outbreak detection model based on danger theory; a bio-inspired method that replicates how the human body fights pathogens. We propose a signal formalization approach based on cumulative sum and a cumulative mature antigen contact value to suit the outbreak characteristic and danger theory. Two outbreak diseases, dengue and SARS, are subjected to a danger theory algorithm; namely the dendritic cell algorithm. To evaluate the model, four measurement metrics are applied: detection rate, specificity, false alarm rate, and accuracy. From the experiment, the proposed model outperforms the other detection approaches and shows a significant improvement for both diseases outbreak detection. The findings reveal that the robustness of the proposed immune model increases when dealing with inconsistent outbreak signals. The model is able to detect new unknown outbreak patterns and can discriminate between outbreak and non-outbreak cases with a consistent high detection rate, high sensitivity, and lower false alarm rate even without a training phase.","publish_time":"2014-08-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohamad Mohsin, Mohamad Farhan; Abu Bakar, Azuraliza; Hamdan, Abdul Razak","journal":"Appl Soft Comput","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d7079e54330e89dde86b8677dd3c5f676aa7159.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185443.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362801/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494614003950; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2014.08.030; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494614003950","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diseases outbreak detection","novel outbreak detection model","outbreak diseases","outbreak characteristic","unseen outbreak patterns","inconsistent outbreak signals","consistent high detection rate","detection approaches","proposed model","non-outbreak cases","trained model","new unknown outbreak patterns","weakness of early outbreak signals","low false alarm rate","lower false alarm rate","proposed immune model","danger theory algorithm","high sensitivity","cumulative sum","terms of robustness","dendritic cell algorithm","cumulative mature antigen contact value","significant improvement","capability","imbalance","study","bio-inspired method","specificity","signal formalization approach","SARS","human body fights pathogens","measurement metrics","key issues","training phase","need","dengue","result","accuracy","problem","experiment","findings"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we developed six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting N protein of PEDV and analyzed their applications on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), western blot assay, and flow cytometry assay. The results demonstrated that all these six mAbs were IgG1 isotype and \u03BA chain. Among these six mAbs, 3F12 recognizes a linear epitope (VAAVKDALKSLGI) while the other five mAbs recognize different conformational epitopes formed by a specific peptide fragment or the full length of N protein. The functional analysis showed that all these six mAbs were applicable to ELISA, western blot, IFA, and flow cytometry assay. In conclusion, we developed six mAbs against PEDV-N protein to facilitate the early detection of PEDV infection using ELISA, western blot, IFA, and flow cytometry.

Methods Six different hand hygiene products were added separately to heparinised blood samples in varying amounts as contaminant.

Results There were significant analytical interferences caused by hand hygiene product contamination that varied depending on the combination of disinfectant and analyser. Small amounts of Microshield Antibacterial Hand Gel contamination caused large increases in measured sodium concentration. Such effect was much greater compared with the other five products tested, and started to occur at much lower levels of contamination. There was a trend towards lower sodium results in blood samples contaminated with Hexol Antiseptic Lotion (Hexol), the hand hygiene product that we used initially. Apart from AiE Hand Sanitizer, all the other hand disinfectants, especially Hexol, significantly elevated the measured potassium concentration, particularly when a direct ion-selective electrode method was used for measurement. Conclusion Hand disinfectant products can significantly interfere with blood electrolyte analysis. Proper precautions must be taken against contamination since the resultant errors can adversely affect the clinical management of patients.","publish_time":"2005-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lam, Hugh S.; Chan, Michael H.M.; Ng, Pak C.; Wong, William; Cheung, Robert C.K.; So, Alan K.W.; Fok, Tai F.; Lam, Christopher W.K.","journal":"Pathology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f736d8fc8aaab0d0e0933fb1895ee06cc3d03d44.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031302516340594; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031302516340594","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Hexol Antiseptic Lotion","AiE Hand Sanitizer"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["blood sodium","blood samples","hand hygiene product contamination","hand disinfectants","contamination of blood specimens","different hand hygiene products","Conclusion Hand disinfectant products","blood electrolyte analysis","AiE Hand Sanitizer","different blood gas","Small amounts of Microshield Antibacterial Hand Gel contamination","measured sodium concentration","lower levels of contamination","contaminated samples","measured potassium concentration","lower sodium results","electrolyte analysers","care electrolyte analysis","combination of disinfectant","significant analytical interferences","Hexol Antiseptic Lotion","varying amounts","potassium concentrations","large increases","point","direct ion-selective electrode method","contaminant","trend","Methods","resultant errors","Summary Aim","clinical management of patients","measurement","Proper precautions","effect"],"language":"en"},

Is the increase in severity of infections an epiphenomenon, meaning respiratory infections just appear more severe in individuals with underlying respiratory disease, or instead a reflection of altered host susceptibility among persons with asthma and atopic disease? The main focus of this review is to summarize the available levels of evidence supporting or refuting the notion that persons with asthma or atopic disease have an altered susceptibility to selected pathogens, as well as discussing the biological mechanism(s) that might explain such associations.

METHODS: We obtained serum proteomic profiles from patients with active tuberculosis and controls by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry. A supervised machine-learning approach based on the support vector machine (SVM) was used to obtain a classifier that distinguished between the groups in two independent test sets. We used k-fold cross validation and random sampling of the SVM classifier to assess the classifier further. Relevant mass peaks were selected by correlational analysis and assessed with SVM. We tested the diagnostic potential of candidate biomarkers, identified by peptide mass fingerprinting, by conventional immunoassays and SVM classifiers trained on these data. FINDINGS: Our SVM classifier discriminated the proteomic profile of patients with active tuberculosis from that of controls with overlapping clinical features. Diagnostic accuracy was 94% (sensitivity 93\u00B75%, specificity 94\u00B79%) for patients with tuberculosis and was unaffected by HIV status. A classifier trained on the 20 most informative peaks achieved diagnostic accuracy of 90%. From these peaks, two peptides (serum amyloid A protein and transthyretin) were identified and quantitated by immunoassay. Because these peptides reflect inflammatory states, we also quantitated neopterin and C reactive protein. Application of an SVM classifier using combinations of these values gave diagnostic accuracies of up to 84% for tuberculosis. Validation on a second, prospectively collected testing set gave similar accuracies using the whole proteomic signature and the 20 selected peaks. Using combinations of the four biomarkers, we achieved diagnostic accuracies of up to 78%. INTERPRETATION: The potential biomarkers for tuberculosis that we identified through proteomic fingerprinting and pattern recognition have a plausible biological connection with the disease and could be used to develop new diagnostic tests.","publish_time":"2006-09-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Agranoff, Dan; Fernandez-Reyes, Delmiro; Papadopoulos, Marios C; Rojas, Sergio A; Herbster, Mark; Loosemore, Alison; Tarelli, Edward; Sheldon, Jo; Schwenk, Achim; Pollok, Richard; Rayner, Charlotte FJ; Krishna, Sanjeev","journal":"Lancet","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/26ad6a4c073e767120b64264371bbb6509f40008.json; document_parses/pdf_json/493fc85d2d65c93216007aa6ce5d105a9a694380.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159276.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606693422; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673606693422","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs2OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SVM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnostic accuracies","active tuberculosis","Diagnostic accuracy","potential of proteomic fingerprinting","potential biomarkers","SVM classifiers","diagnosis of tuberculosis","diagnostic potential of candidate biomarkers","serum proteomic profiles","proteomic signature","proteomic profile of patients","Relevant mass peaks","selected peaks","peptide mass fingerprinting","new diagnostic tests","informative peaks","mass spectrometric serum profiling","controls","serum amyloid","pattern recognition methods","similar accuracies","combinations","peptides","cross validation","surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry","support vector machine","C reactive protein","supervised machine-learning approach","conventional immunoassays","plausible biological connection","neopterin","random sampling","values","correlational analysis","groups","overlapping clinical features","independent test sets","disease","inflammatory states","testing set","HIV status","transthyretin","sensitivity","Application","INTERPRETATION","specificity","data","FINDINGS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Many cases of subclinical BRD go untreated and are not detected until slaughter, when lung lesions are identified. The objectives of this study were to identify which BRD pathogens were associated with the presence of lung lesions at harvest and to identify genomic loci that were associated with susceptibility to lung lesions as defined by consolidation of the lung and/or the presence of fibrin tissue. Steers from a Colorado feedlot (n = 920) were tested for the presence of viral and bacterial pathogens using deep pharyngeal and mid-nasal swabs collected on entry into the study. Pathogen profiles were compared between cattle with or without lung consolidation (LC), fibrin tissue in the lung (FT), a combination of LC and FT in the same lung (lung lesions [LL]), and hyperinflated lungs (HIF) at harvest. Genotyping was conducted using the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip. Genomewide association analyses (GWAA) were conducted using EMMAX (efficient mixed-model association eXpedited), and pseudoheritabilities were estimated. The pathogen profile comparisons revealed that LC (P = 0.01, odds ratio [OR] = 3.37) and LL cattle (P = 0.04, OR = 4.58) were more likely to be infected with bovine herpes virus-1 and that HIF cattle were more likely to be infected with Mycoplasma spp. (P = 0.04, OR = 4.33). Pseudoheritability estimates were 0.25 for LC, 0.00 for FT, 0.28 for LL, and 0.13 for HIF. Because pseudoheritability for FT was estimated to be 0, GWAA results for FT were not reported. There were 4 QTL that were moderately associated (P \u003C 1 \u00D7 10(\u22125)) with only LC, 2 that were associated with only LL, and 1 that was associated with LC and LL. Loci associated with HIF included 12 that were moderately associated and 3 that were strongly associated (uncorrected P \u003C 5 \u00D7 10\u22127). A 24-kb region surrounding significant lead SNP was investigated to identify positional candidate genes. Many positional candidate genes underlying or flanking the detected QTL have been associated with signal transduction, cell adhesion, or gap junctions, which have functional relevance to the maintenance of lung health. The identification of pathogens and QTL associated with the presence of lung abnormalities in cattle exhibiting subclinical BRD allows the identification of loci that may not be detected through manifestation of clinical disease alone.","publish_time":"2017-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"J Anim Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f37254faffbf748366924b1629298b7e5c5c8ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110184.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2017.1548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28727052/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BRD","Illumina","HIF","LC","SNP","QTL"],"locations":["Colorado"],"keyphrases":["lung consolidation","presence of lung lesions","presence of lung abnormalities","FT","HIF cattle","LL cattle","BRD pathogens","maintenance of lung health","combination of LC","presence of viral","BRD complex","detected QTL","uncorrected P","important disease of feedlot cattle","cases of subclinical BRD","presence of fibrin tissue","bacterial pathogens","identification of pathogens","identification of loci","bacterial pathogen members","harvest","positional candidate genes","Bovine respiratory disease","Pathogen profiles","genomic loci","study","pathogen profile comparisons","manifestation of clinical disease","Colorado feedlot","GWAA results","Pseudoheritability estimates","Genomewide association analyses","bovine herpes virus","efficient mixed-model association","mid-nasal swabs","gap junctions","functional relevance","cell adhesion","EMMAX","signal transduction","significant lead SNP","entry","hyperinflated lungs","susceptibility","region","Steers","slaughter","Illumina BovineHD BeadChip","odds ratio","Genotyping","pseudoheritabilities","Mycoplasma","objectives"],"language":"en"},

Use of medical devices with antimicrobial functions has been considered as a major avenue to fight against microbial infections. In addition, suitable packaging can slow the deterioration rate, and hence, extend the shelf-life of food. Physical and chemical incorporation of antimicrobial agents into polyolefins can be implemented in common polyolefin processing. In this chapter, antimicrobial polyolefins are summarized based on processes that were studied to incorporate biocides into the polymers. These processes include blending, coating, and chemical modifications.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"BADROSSAMAY, M; SUN, G","journal":"Polyolefin Fibres","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/709914eafafdc734870d25e213cffd259a9aa7b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152401.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781845692070500081; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781845692070500081","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antimicrobial polyolefins","medical textiles","medical devices","antimicrobial functions","processes","chemical incorporation of antimicrobial agents","unique characteristics of polyolefins","polymeric materials","fibrous materials","chemical modifications","single use healthcare products","best candidates","hotels","hospitals","good media","cross-transmission","suitable packaging","diseases","microorganisms","blending","coating","major avenue","water filters","microbial infections","deterioration rate","hours","common polyolefin processing","shelf-life","food","addition"],"language":"en"},

In this study, we showed that the overexpression of nsp11 of PRRSV induced a strong suppression of IFN production. Nsp11 suppressed both IRF3 and NF-\u03BAB activities when stimulated with a dsRNA analogue and TNF-\u03B1, respectively. This suppression was RLR dependent, since the transcripts and proteins of MAVS and RIG-I, two critical factors in RLR-mediated pathway, were both found to be reduced in the presence of overexpressed nsp11. Since nsp11 is an endoribonuclease (EndoU), the structure function relationship was examined using a series of nsp11 EndoU mutant plasmids. The mutants that impaired the EndoU activity failed to suppress IFN and led to the normal expression of MAVS. Seven single amino acid substitutions (4 in subdomain A and 3 in subdomain B) plus one insertion (frame-shift in nsp11) were then introduced into PRRSV infectious cDNA clones to generate nsp11 mutant viruses. Unfortunately, all EndoU knock-out nsp11 mutant viruses appeared replication-defective and no progenies were produced. Three mutations in EndoU subdomain A expressed the N and nsp2/3 proteins but their infectivity diminished after 2 passages. Taken together, our data show that PRRSV nsp11 endoribonuclease activity is critical for both viral replication and IFN antagonism. More importantly, the endoribonuclease activity of nsp11 demonstrates the substrate specificity towards MAVS and RIG-I (transcripts and proteins) over p65 and IRF3 in the context of gene transfection and overexpression. This is likely a mechanism of nsp11 suppression of type I IFN production.","publish_time":"2016-12-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Yan; Ke, Hanzhong; Han, Mingyuan; Chen, Ning; Fang, Weihuan; Yoo, Dongwan","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a3f75f7f759c60426c7a47b9cd2470a70ef244c0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5172586.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27997564/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0168314","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs3ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IFN","PRRSV","MAVS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overexpression of nsp11","endoribonuclease activity of nsp11","nsp11 mutant viruses","PRRSV nsp11 endoribonuclease activity","presence of overexpressed nsp11","mechanism of nsp11 suppression of type","series of nsp11 EndoU mutant plasmids","EndoU activity","EndoU subdomain","IFN-\u03B1","IFN response","IFN antagonism","strong suppression of IFN production","EndoU knock","proteins of MAVS","RIG","IRF3","transcripts","subdomain B","PRRSV infectious cDNA clones","normal expression of MAVS","critical factors","viral replication","replication-defective","RLR dependent","TNF-\u03B1","respiratory syndrome virus","virus-infected cells","RLR-mediated pathway","antiviral defense","substrate specificity","key role","insertion","dsRNA analogue","NF-\u03BAB activities","context of gene transfection","structure function relationship","nsp2","p65","single amino acid substitutions","data","frame-shift","pigs","infectivity","interferons","progenies","mutations","mutants","passages","study"],"language":"en"},

Two groups of calves from conventional dairy farms were studied. The animals were examined 10 times during the first six weeks after introduction into a new environment. Haptoglobin, SAA and fibrinogen were analysed and weight gain, disease symptoms and treatments were recorded. Analysis of antibodies against viral infections was performed. An acute phase reaction (APR) score was established at each sampling by combining the APP results and total leukocyte counts. The health status differed between the two groups, although no manipulation of health had been performed, except that the group with a higher incidence of disease had a concurrent experimental infection with lungworm as part of another study. In the group with a higher incidence of disease, the mean weight gain was significantly lower, and the number of sampling days with elevated serum concentrations of APPs, and the mean maximum concentrations of haptoglobin and fibrinogen were significantly higher compared to the healthier group. The APR score was significantly higher at days 4 and 8 of the study in the group with a higher incidence of disease.

An accurate prognosis is essential for decision-making during pandemic as well as interpandemic periods. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted to determine prognostic factors influencing short term outcome of critically ill patients with confirmed influenza virus infection. Baseline characteristics, laboratory and diagnostic findings, ICU interventions and complications were abstracted from medical records using standard definitions and compared between hospital survivors and non-survivors with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results 111 patients met the inclusion criteria. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicated ICU course in 25 (23%) of the patients, with mortality rate of 52%.

To better understand the effect of price adjustments on physician choice, this study used renin-angiotensin drugs (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) to examine the impact of price adjustments on utilization of and expenditures on patented and off-patent drugs with the same therapeutic indication. METHODS: Using the Taiwan\u2019s Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (2005), we identified 147,157 patients received ACEIs and/or ARBs between 1997 and 2008. The annual incident and prevalent users of ACEIs, ARBs and overall renin-angiotensin drugs were examined. Box-Tiao intervention analysis was applied to assess the impact of price adjustments on monthly utilization of and expenditures on these drugs. ACEIs were divided into patented and off-patent drugs, off-patent ACEIs were further divided into original brands and generics, and subgroup analyses were performed. RESULTS: The number of incident renin-angiotensin drug users decreased over the study period. The number of prevalent ARB users increased and exceeded the cumulative number of first-time renin-angiotensin drug users starting on ARBs, implying that some patients switched from ACEIs to ARBs. After price adjustments, long term trend increases in utilization were observed for patented ACEIs and ARBs; a long-term trend decrease was observed for off-patent ACEIs; long-term trend change was not significant for overall renin-angiotensin drugs. Significant long-term trend increases in expenditures were observed for patented ACEIs after price adjustment in 2007 (200.9%, p = 0.0088) and in ARBs after price adjustments in 2001 (173.4%, p \u003C 0.0001) and 2007 (146.3%, p \u003C 0.0001). A significant long-term trend decrease in expenditures was observed for off-patent ACEIs after 2004 price adjustment (\u2212156.9%, p \u003C 0.0001). Expenditures on overall renin-angiotensin drugs showed long-term trend increases after price adjustments in 2001 (72.2%, p \u003C 0.0001) and 2007 (133.4%, p \u003C 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Price adjustments did not achieve long-term cost savings for overall renin-angiotensin drugs. Possible switching from ACEIs to ARBs within individuals is evident. Policy makers should reconsider the appropriateness of the current adjustment strategies applied to patented and off-patent drugs.","publish_time":"2012-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Shiou-Huei; Hsu, Chien-Ning; Yu, Shu-Hui; Cham, Thau-Ming","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c83a45d3f3e227de8b5e0e88022352385dd78e8.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5ee02e510d7fb0b2523b669dacadf4f56ee6b55f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3464938.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22521158/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-12-288","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4NTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARB"],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["patent ACEIs","patented ACEIs","ARBs","patent drugs","overall renin-angiotensin drugs","drug price adjustments","impact of price adjustments","effect of price adjustments","prevalent users of ACEIs","generic drugs","Significant long-term trend","expenditures","number of incident renin-angiotensin drug users","long-term trend decrease","long-term trend change","cumulative number of first-time renin-angiotensin drug users","angiotensin receptor blockers","long-term cost savings","long term trend","number of prevalent ARB users","monthly utilization","previous study","study period","patients","current adjustment strategies","annual incident","physicians","physician choice","appropriateness","greater profit","original brands","Taiwan\u2019s Longitudinal Health Insurance Database","enzyme inhibitors","generics","individuals","subgroup analyses","Possible switching","Box-Tiao intervention analysis","METHODS","RESULTS","therapeutic indication","Policy makers","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Here, we will review these studies with emphasis on novel direct roles of V-ATPase in the regulation of vesicular trafficking events.","publish_time":"2008-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marshansky, Vladimir; Futai, Masamitsu","journal":"Current Opinion in Cell Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a8c198ee608a0c494849219efb1a2f485df42c4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111286.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceb.2008.03.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18511251/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0955067408000562; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955067408000562","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["V-ATPase","Deficient function of V","defects of vesicular acidification","regulation of vesicular trafficking events","novel direct roles of V","cell biological role of V","organellar acidification","understanding of function","exocytotic","driven proton","emphasis","variety of human diseases","endocytotic pathways of eukaryotic cells","studies","important mechanisms","significant progress","Vacuolar-type H","past","years","potential therapeutic targets"],"language":"en"},

At the present, there exists no specific therapy for HEV. The natural compound silvestrol has a potent antiviral effect against the (\u2212)-strand RNA-virus Ebola virus, and also against the (\u002B)-strand RNA viruses Corona-, Picorna-, and Zika virus. The inhibitory effect on virus spread is due to an inhibition of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, which is required to unwind structured 5\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs). This leads to an impaired translation of viral RNA. The HEV (\u002B)-strand RNA genome contains a 5\u2032-capped, short 5\u2032-UTR. This study aims to analyze the impact of silvestrol on the HEV life cycle. Persistently infected A549 cells were instrumental. This study identifies silvestrol as a potent inhibitor of the release of HEV infectious viral particles. This goes along with a strongly reduced HEV capsid protein translation, retention of viral RNA inside the cytoplasm, and without major cytotoxic effects. Interestingly, in parallel silvestrol affects the activity of the antiviral major vault protein (MVP) by translocation from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear membrane. These data further characterize the complex antiviral activity of silvestrol and show silvestrol\u2019s broad spectrum of function, since HEV is a virus without complex secondary structures in its genome, but it is still affected.","publish_time":"2018-06-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Glitscher, Mirco; Himmelsbach, Kiyoshi; Woytinek, Kathrin; Johne, Reimar; Reuter, Andreas; Spiric, Jelena; Schwaben, Luisa; Gr\u00FCnweller, Arnold; Hildt, Eberhard","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/85f48fe473305b86d997f44a5801859364b8952b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6024817.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v10060301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29865243/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HEV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strand RNA-virus Ebola virus","strand RNA genome","virus spread","Zika virus","retention of viral RNA","HEV life cycle","complex antiviral activity of silvestrol","impact of silvestrol","impaired translation of viral RNA","parallel silvestrol","reduced HEV capsid protein translation","release of HEV infectious viral particles","strand RNA viruses Corona","potent antiviral effect","natural compound silvestrol","Mio hepatitis E virus","antiviral major vault protein","cytoplasm","DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A","study","potent inhibitor","inhibitory effect","complex secondary structures","major cytotoxic effects","MVP","Picorna","silvestrol\u2019s broad spectrum of function","translocation","inhibition","infections","untranslated regions","infected A549 cells","specific therapy","data","deaths","perinuclear membrane","UTRs","year"],"language":"en"},

In addition, an evaluation of the effects of meteorological factors on the incidence of HBoV in a subtropical area in China will be conducted. Children were \u003C14 years in age and hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infection between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2012 in the Respiratory Disease Department at the Children\u0027s Hospital affiliated to Soochow University. Multi\u2010pathogens were detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. The association between HBoV activity and regional meteorological conditions was analyzed. The average incidence of HBoV infection was 6.6% (502/7,626). Of the 502 HBoV positive children, the median age was 13 months (range 1\u2013156 months). The HBoV infection rate was highest among the 7\u201312 months groups (12.9%, 163/1,267).

Rapid characterization of seasonal dynamics and forecasting of epidemic peaks and final sizes could help support real-time decision-making related to vaccination and other control measures. Real-time forecasting remains challenging. METHODS: We used the previously described \u201Cincidence decay with exponential adjustment\u201D (IDEA) model, a 2-parameter phenomenological model, to evaluate the characteristics of the 2015\u20132016 influenza season in 4 Canadian jurisdictions: the Provinces of Alberta, Nova Scotia and Ontario, and the City of Ottawa. Model fits were updated weekly with receipt of incident virologically confirmed case counts. Best-fit models were used to project seasonal influenza peaks and epidemic final sizes. RESULTS: The 2015\u20132016 influenza season was mild and late-peaking. Parameter estimates generated through fitting were consistent in the 2 largest jurisdictions (Ontario and Alberta) and with pooled data including Nova Scotia counts (R(0) approximately 1.4 for all fits). Lower R(0) estimates were generated in Nova Scotia and Ottawa. Final size projections that made use of complete time series were accurate to within 6% of true final sizes, but final size was using pre-peak data. Projections of epidemic peaks stabilized before the true epidemic peak, but these were persistently early (~2 weeks) relative to the true peak. CONCLUSIONS: A simple, 2-parameter influenza model provided reasonably accurate real-time projections of influenza seasonal dynamics in an atypically late, mild influenza season. Challenges are similar to those seen with more complex forecasting methodologies. Future work includes identification of seasonal characteristics associated with variability in model performance.","publish_time":"2017-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nasserie, Tahmina; Tuite, Ashleigh R; Whitmore, Lindsay; Hatchette, Todd; Drews, Steven J; Peci, Adriana; Kwong, Jeffrey C; Friedman, Dara; Garber, Gary; Gubbay, Jonathan; Fisman, David N","journal":"Open Forum Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9bad339dd5a9605d61cc773ecfe0c65d4402f4b7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5781299.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29497629/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofx166","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Ottawa","Alberta","Nova Scotia"],"keyphrases":["seasonal influenza peaks","parameter influenza model","Seasonal influenza epidemics","epidemic final sizes","mild influenza season","accurate real-time projections of influenza seasonal dynamics","true final sizes","Model fits","Final size projections","Projections of epidemic peaks","true epidemic peak","parameter phenomenological model","model performance","true peak","Real-time forecasting","identification of seasonal characteristics","Nova Scotia counts","Parameter estimates","Rapid characterization of seasonal dynamics","real-time decision-making","Ontario","pre-peak data","complex forecasting methodologies","Provinces of Alberta","pooled data","largest jurisdictions","Canadian jurisdictions","late-peaking","Lower R","City of Ottawa","confirmed case counts","use of complete time series","exponential adjustment","receipt of incident","variability","vaccination","IDEA","fitting","Future work","incidence decay","weeks","BACKGROUND","control measures","fit models","Challenges","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Methods A reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay targeting the P gene was developed in this study and used to detect hMPV in nasal and throat swabs collected from 2936 immunocompetent adult patients with ARTIs in Beijing, China between July 2008 and June 2010. Results Among the 2936 patients studied, 49 (1.7%) were positive for hMPV, of whom 14 (28.6%) were positive for hMPV_A2b, 19 (38.8%) for hMPV_B1, and 16 (32.6%) for hMPV_B2. hMPV_A1 was not detected. An average detection rate of 6.6% was observed in the peak months of the two epidemic seasons studied. The hMPV prevalence was higher in the sampled elderly (\u003E65 years, 3.2%) than in middle aged adults (25\u201365 years; 2.0%) and teenagers (14\u201325 years; 0.9%). During the study period, hMPV infections showed a biennial rhythm of seasonality, peaking from November to March in 2008/09 and from March to June in 2010. Conclusion hMPV infection plays an important role in immunocompetent adults in its epidemic season. The demographic and clinical data presented in this study improves our understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical burden of hMPV infection in adults.","publish_time":"2012-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jianguo; Wang, Zhong; Gonzalez, Richard; Xiao, Yan; Zhou, Hongli; Zhang, Jing; Paranhos-Baccala, Glaucia; Vernet, Guy; Jin, Qi; Wang, Jianwei; Hung, Tao","journal":"Journal of Infection","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c31925cc082bf700f258e773cf66125962b042b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112659.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445311005305; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2011.10.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22085814/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445311005305","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUwLmNzdjs5NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1688076,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:36Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vzTzhYn7SeGFIubbm2DOOg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_50.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ARTIs"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Beijing"],"keyphrases":["hMPV infections","hMPV prevalence","Conclusion hMPV infection","clinical burden of hMPV infection","immunocompetent adults","years","immunocompetent Chinese adults","immunocompetent adult patients","ARTIs","clinical data","middle aged adults","study period","RT-PCR","clinical manifestations of human metapneumovirus","epidemic seasons","reverse transcription PCR","acute respiratory tract infections","important role","pathogenesis","throat swabs","assay","Beijing","sampled elderly","Methods","P gene","biennial rhythm of seasonality","understanding","peak months","China","nasal","Summary Objective","average detection rate","demographic","teenagers","A2b","Results","B1","B2"],"language":"en"},

Such major viral outbreaks demand early elucidation of taxonomic classification and origin of the virus genomic sequence, for strategic planning, containment, and treatment. This paper identifies an intrinsic COVID-19 virus genomic signature and uses it together with a machine learning-based alignment-free approach for an ultra-fast, scalable, and highly accurate classification of whole COVID-19 virus genomes. The proposed method combines supervised machine learning with digital signal processing (MLDSP) for genome analyses, augmented by a decision tree approach to the machine learning component, and a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient analysis for result validation. These tools are used to analyze a large dataset of over 5000 unique viral genomic sequences, totalling 61.8 million bp, including the 29 COVID-19 virus sequences available on January 27, 2020. Our results support a hypothesis of a bat origin and classify the COVID-19 virus as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus. Our method achieves 100% accurate classification of the COVID-19 virus sequences, and discovers the most relevant relationships among over 5000 viral genomes within a few minutes, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone, and without any specialized biological knowledge, training, gene or genome annotations. This suggests that, for novel viral and pathogen genome sequences, this alignment-free whole-genome machine-learning approach can provide a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Randhawa, Gurjit S.; Soltysiak, Maximillian P.

However, the diagnosis of human coronavirus infections is not carried out routinely, primarily because the isolation and propagation of these viruses in tissue culture is difficult and time consuming. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of recombinant, bacterial expressed proteins in the serodiagnosis of coronavirus infections. Two proteins were examined: the human coronavirus 229E nucleocapsid protein (N), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pUR and the coronavirus 229E surface glycoprotein (S), expressed as a fusion protein in the vector pROS. The recombinant proteins were used as antigens in Western blot (WB) assays to detect the 229E-specific IgG antibodies and the results were compared with a standard serological method, indirect immunofluorescence. Serum samples of 51 paediatric patients, suffering from acute respiratory illness, and 10 adults, voluntarily infected with human coronavirus, were tested. The serum samples of the adult group had coronavirus-specific IgG antibodies in both test systems. In contrast, only 8 51 sera of the paediatric group were positive for coronavirus-specific IgG by both WB and IF and 20 51 sera were positive by WB, but not by IF. The overall incidence of human coronavirus infections in the paediatric age group was 55% evaluated by WB analysis and 16% evaluated by IF.

We have previously shown that C12 has two amino acid substitutions relative to wild type virus in the spike protein, Q159L (within a region of S1 shown to bind to viral receptor in anin vitroassay) and H716D (in the proteolytic cleavage recognition site). We have sequenced the rest of the 31-kb genome of C12 and compared it to wild type virus. Only three additional amino acids substitutions were found, all encoded within the replicase gene. Analysis of C12in vivoin C57Bl/6 mice has shown that despite the fact that this virus replicates in the brain to titers at least as high as wild type and causes acute encephalitis similar to wild type, this virus causes a minimal level of demyelination and only at very high levels of virus inoculation. Thus acute encephalitis is not sufficient for the induction of demyelination by MHV-A59. Analysis of mutants isolated at earlier times from the same persistently infected glial cell culture as C12, as well as mutants isolated from a second independent culture of persistently infected glial cells, suggests that both the weakly demyelinating and the weakly hepatotropic phenotypes of C12 are associated with the Q159L amino acid substitution.","publish_time":"1997-12-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leparc-Goffart, Isabelle; Hingley, Susan T.; Chua, Ming Ming; Jiang, Xinhe; Lavi, Ehud; Weiss, Susan R.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09ee74a630587010f95296fec1f79b8b64ff2e09.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682297988772; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682297988772","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs5Njc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wild type virus","virus replicates","Abstract C12","genome of C12","weakly hepatotropic phenotypes of C12","high levels of virus inoculation","MHV-A59","weakly hepatotropic mutant of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","weakly demyelinating","amino acid substitutions relative","Q159L amino acid substitution","Analysis of mutants","infected glial cell culture","additional amino acids substitutions","acute encephalitis similar","infected glial cells","induction of demyelination","independent culture","minimal level of demyelination","Analysis of C12in vivoin C57Bl","H716D","titers","spike protein","viral receptor","earlier times","mice","anin vitroassay","brain","proteolytic cleavage recognition site","region of S1","fact","replicase gene","rest"],"language":"en"},

A novel human coronavirus, subsequently named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September of 2012. With increasing numbers of infections and deaths from MERS-CoV, development of a rapid and reliable kit was crucial to prevent further spread of MERS-CoV. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we present two real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays for in-house rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing of MERS-CoV, detecting the regions upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame (ORF) 1b, respectively, for initial screening and final confirmation of MERS-CoV infection, as recommended by the world health organization (WHO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, acquiring patient samples was difficult; thus, according to WHO recommendations and standard protocols, we synthesized RNA sequences of upE and ORF1b genes as the template signatures and TaqMan based-diagnostic rRT-PCR assays were carried out using these synthetic genes for detection of MERS-CoV. In this research, we also inaugurated a cell-free system to transcribe these RNA sequences using the DNA templates synthesized. RESULTS: The upE and ORF1b based one-step rRT-PCR assays were optimized by testing several times via different synthetic RNAs, and validation results were highly successful. The sensitivity obtained for upE was fewer than ten copies of RNA template per reaction and for ORF1b was 50 or fewer copies per reaction. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the developed rRT-PCR assays are rapid, reliable, reproducible, specific, sensitive, and simple tools for detection of MERS-CoV. Finally, a kit consisting of two assay signatures and controls was assembled, which can be distributed to public health laboratories in Iran to support international MERS-CoV surveillance and public health response.","publish_time":"2016-06-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hashemzadeh, Mohammad Sadegh; Rasouli, Rahimeh; Zahraei, Bentolhoda; Izadi, Morteza; Tat, Mahdi; Saadat, Seyed Hassan; Najarasl, Mohammad; Khansari Nejad, Behzad; Dorostkar, Ruhollah","journal":"Iran Red Crescent Med J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9f9984a45e51e8268ed00e6de9ca8b23615fb154.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5292137.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.5812/ircmj.23874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28191331/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":["Saudi Arabia","Iran"],"keyphrases":["detection of MERS","international MERS-CoV surveillance","CoV infection","diagnostic rRT-PCR assays","sensitive diagnostic testing of MERS","final confirmation of MERS","RNA sequences of upE","developed rRT-PCR assays","one-step rRT-PCR assays","copies of RNA template","ORF1b genes","template signatures","synthetic genes","public health laboratories","experimental study","reliable kit","public health response","fewer copies","world health organization","respiratory disease","validation results","assay signatures","middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus","real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction","different synthetic RNAs","novel human coronavirus","deaths","Iran","TaqMan","development","open reading frame","large ribonucleic acid","simple tools","CoVs","initial screening","envelope gene","Coronaviruses","patient samples","increasing numbers of infections","standard protocols","times","regions","cell-free system","humans","METHODS","DNA templates","MATERIALS","BACKGROUND","recommendations","controls","sensitivity","Saudi Arabia","research","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Human enteric viruses have been identified as leading causative agents of acute gastroenteritis as well as foodborne illnesses in the U.S. and are generally transmitted by fecal-oral contamination. There is growing evidence of transmission occurring via contaminated fomite including food contact surfaces. Additionally, human enteric viruses have been shown to remain infectious on fomites over prolonged periods of time. To better understand viral persistence, there is a need for more studies to investigate this phenomenon. Therefore, optimization of surface sampling methods is essential to aid in understanding environmental contamination to ensure proper preventative measures are being applied. In general, surface sampling studies are limited and highly variable among recovery efficiencies and research parameters used (e.g., virus type/density, surface type, elution buffers, tools). This review aims to discuss the various factors impacting surface sampling of viruses from fomites and to explore how researchers could move towards a more sensitive and standard sampling method.","publish_time":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Turnage, Nicole L.; Gibson, Kristen E.","journal":"Journal of Virological Methods","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/580cbd605ccd8a2ba964488b5a5adb258adcf42a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7113692.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609341730277X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28633964/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.06.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016609341730277X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["surface sampling of viruses","surface sampling studies","surface type","optimization of surface sampling methods","Human enteric viruses","fomites","standard sampling method","Abstract Acute gastroenteritis","virus type","environmental contamination","leading causative agents of acute gastroenteritis","fecal-oral contamination","highest infectious disease burden","contaminated fomite","density","research parameters","elution buffers","various factors","food contact surfaces","recovery efficiencies","proper preventative measures","tools","prolonged periods of time","evidence of transmission","need","foodborne illnesses","viral persistence","review","researchers","phenomenon"],"language":"en"},

However, synthesis and full investigation from preclinical studies to phase III trials of new medications is a time-consuming procedure, and not viable in a global emergency, such as the one we are facing. MAIN BODY: Drug repurposing/repositioning, a strategy effectively employed in cancer treatment, can represent a valid alternative. Most drugs considered for repurposing/repositioning in the therapy of the COVID-19 outbreak are commercially available and their dosage and toxicity in humans is well known, due to years (or even decades) of clinical use. This can allow their fast-track evaluation in phase II\u2013III clinical trials, or even within straightforward compassionate use. Several drugs being re-considered for COVID-19 therapy are or have been used in cancer therapy. Indeed, virus-infected cells are pushed to enhance the synthesis of nucleic acids, protein and lipid synthesis and boost their energy metabolism, in order to comply to the \u201Cviral program\u201D. Indeed, the same features are seen in cancer cells, making it likely that drugs interfering with specific cancer cell pathways may be effective as well in defeating viral replication.

However, the differential roles of the three HRV species HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C in pediatric CAP are not fully understood. Objective To determine the distribution of HRV species and their roles in children hospitalized with CAP in Beijing, China. Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected between April 2007 and March 2008 from 554 children with a primary diagnosis of CAP. HRVs in the clinical samples were detected by RT-PCR and by sequencing. Infections with other respiratory viruses were identified by PCR. Results HRVs were detected in 99 patients (17.87%). Among these patients, 51.52% tested positive for HRV-A, 38.38% for HRV-C, and 10.10% for HRV-B. HRVs were detected throughout the study period. The monthly distribution of HRV infections varied with HRV species. Median age, gender, symptoms, severity, and duration of hospitalization for single HRV-C infections were similar to those observed for single HRV-A infections. Co-infections with other respiratory viruses were detected in 57.58% of the HRV-positive children. HRV/RSV dual infections were correlated with a higher frequency of shortness of breath (HRV-A group, P 2tail =0.01; HRV-C group, P 2tail =0.015) and lower median ages (HRV-A group, P 2tail =0.049; HRV-C group, P 2tail =0.009). Conclusion Our study shows that HRV-C strains circulate at a prevalence intermediate between HRV-A and HRV-B. The severity of clinical manifestations for HRV-C is comparable to that for HRV-A in children with CAP. These findings point to an important role of both HRV-A and HRV-C in pediatric CAP.","publish_time":"2010-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiang, Zichun; Gonzalez, Richard; Xie, Zhengde; Xiao, Yan; Liu, Jun; Chen, Lan; Liu, Chunyan; Zhang, Jing; Ren, Lili; Vernet, Guy; Paranhos-Baccal\u00E0, Gl\u00E1ucia; Shen, Kunling; Jin, Qi; Wang, Jianwei","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a371e62bc833da74343b8ed059abc7a6f13dfe90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185749.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2010.07.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653210003021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653210003021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20728404/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HRV","CAP","PCR"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["HRV species HRV","HRV-B","HRV-C group","HRV-C strains","HRV-positive children","single HRV-C infections","distribution of HRV species","monthly distribution of HRV infections","tail","Co-infections","RSV dual infections","Results HRVs","pediatric CAP","respiratory viruses","study period","patients","severity of clinical manifestations","clinical samples","differential roles","RT-PCR","Study design Nasopharyngeal aspirates","lower median ages","duration of hospitalization","symptoms","pneumonia","breath","higher frequency of shortness","prevalence intermediate","Abstract Background Human rhinoviruses","gender","common causes of community","primary diagnosis of","findings","important role","Beijing","sequencing","China","Objective","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The only known example of a human satellite virus is the hepatitis D virus (HDV), and it is generally thought to require hepatitis B virus (HBV) to form infectious particles. Until 2018, HDV was the sole representative of the genus Deltavirus and was thought to have evolved in humans, the only known HDV host. The subsequent identification of HDV-like agents in birds, snakes, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates indicated that the evolutionary history of deltaviruses is likely much longer than previously hypothesized. Interestingly, none of the HDV-like agents were found in coinfection with an HBV-like agent, suggesting that these viruses use different helper virus(es). Here we show, using snake deltavirus (SDeV), that HBV and hepadnaviruses represent only one example of helper viruses for deltaviruses. We cloned the SDeV genome into a mammalian expression plasmid, and by transfection could initiate SDeV replication in cultured snake and mammalian cell lines. By superinfecting persistently SDeV-infected cells with reptarenaviruses and hartmaniviruses, or by transfecting their surface proteins, we could induce production of infectious SDeV particles. Our findings indicate that deltaviruses can likely use a multitude of helper viruses or even viral glycoproteins to form infectious particles. This suggests that persistent infections, such as those caused by arenaviruses and orthohantaviruses used in this study, and recurrent infections would be beneficial for the spread of deltaviruses. It seems plausible that further human or animal disease associations with deltavirus infections will be identified in the future.","publish_time":"2020-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Szirovicza, Leonora; Hetzel, Udo; Kipar, Anja; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Vapalahti, Olli; Hepojoki, Jussi","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0baa9e01f27eceb210c79f80a13cc06b50c1830f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7078484.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03250-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32184255/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["example of helper viruses","SDeV replication","Satellite viruses","multitude of helper viruses","different helper virus","SDeV genome","HBV","deltavirus infections","production of infectious SDeV particles","infectious particles","human satellite virus","known HDV host","snake deltavirus","spread of deltaviruses","hepatitis D virus","hepatitis B virus","SDeV-infected cells","subsequent identification of HDV","agents","known example","genus Deltavirus","recurrent infections","evolutionary history of deltaviruses","persistent infections","cultured snake","replication cycle","mammalian expression plasmid","mammalian cell lines","transfection","animal disease associations","viral glycoproteins","fish","birds","hartmaniviruses","invertebrates","amphibians","snakes","study","reptarenaviruses","sole representative","hepadnaviruses","coinfection","humans","plants","surface proteins","orthohantaviruses","future","findings"],"language":"en"},

In Vietnam, pig slurry is commonly applied to biogas digesters for production of gas for electricity and cooking with the effluent being used to fertilize field crops, vegetables and fish ponds. Slurry may contain a variety of zoonotic pathogens, e.g. Salmonella spp., which are able to cause disease in humans either through direct contact with slurry or by fecal contamination of water and foods. The objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of Salmonella spp. and the fecal indicator bacteria, enterococci, E. coli, and spores of Clostridium perfringens in biogas digesters operated by small-scale Vietnamese pig farmers. The serovar and antimicrobial susceptibility of the Salmonella spp. isolated were also established. The study was conducted in 12 farms (6 farms with and 6 farms without toilet connected) located in Hanam province, Vietnam. Sampling of pig slurry and biogas effluent was done during two seasons. Results showed that the concentration of enterococci, E. coli, and Clostridium perfringens spores was overall reduced by only 1\u20132log10-units in the biogas digesters when comparing raw slurry and biogas effluent. Salmonella spp. was found in both raw slurry and biogas effluent. A total of 19 Salmonella serovars were identified, with the main serovars being Salmonella Typhimurium (55/138), Salmonella enterica serovar 4,[5],12:i:- (19/138), Salmonella Weltevreden (9/138) and Salmonella Rissen (9/138). The Salmonella serovars showed similar antimicrobial resistance patterns to those previously reported from Vietnam. When promoting biogas, farmers should be made aware that effluent should only be used as fertilizer for crops not consumed raw and that indiscriminate discharge of effluent are likely to contaminate water recipients, e.g. drinking water sources, with pathogens. Relevant authorities should promote safe animal manure management practices to farmers and regulations be updated to ensure food safety and public health.","publish_time":"2014-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huong, Luu Quynh; Forslund, Anita; Madsen, Henry; Dalsgaard, Anders","journal":"International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3322e82fcffb7cfd2de8b8b9db7b86340fe5b4b0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106344.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463914000388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24933419/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2014.04.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463914000388","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella","E. coli","Salmonella Typhimurium","Salmonella Weltevreden"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Vietnam"],"keyphrases":["biogas effluent","Salmonella serovars","Salmonella Typhimurium","survival of Salmonella","Salmonella Weltevreden","Salmonella Rissen","raw slurry","Salmonella enterica serovar","Abstract Small-scale biogas digesters","Sampling of pig slurry","farms","indiscriminate discharge of effluent","small-scale Vietnamese pig farmers","coli","water recipients","fecal contamination of water","spores of Clostridium perfringens","Clostridium perfringens spores","main serovars","study","drinking water sources","livestock manure","field crops","antimicrobial susceptibility","concentration of enterococci","fecal indicator bacteria","variety of zoonotic pathogens","similar antimicrobial resistance patterns","safe animal manure management practices","regulations","direct contact","humans","electricity","production of gas","Relevant authorities","food safety","disease","vegetables","fish ponds","cooking","toilet","public health","sustainable technology","Hanam province","foods","2log10-units","fertilizer","Results","total","seasons","objective"],"language":"en"},

With rapid urbanisation, these differences have become a major cause of urban\u2013rural conflict. One of the most significant challenges arises from land acquisition, particularly in China, where cities have experienced substantial growth in the 21st century. Different types of risk are associated with land acquisition conflict in different Chinese cities. In this study, two types of cities are discussed: those with a historically low level of development but recent rapid economic growth, such as Yueqing; and cities that have maintained a relatively high level of development and experienced stable growth, such as Jiaxing. Land acquisition conflict in these two representative cities is then analysed in terms of property rights, access to resources and development. Analysis is performed at the institutional level to provide more accurate insights into the dynamics of conflict. The findings of the study suggest that different risk-management strategies are used in the two kinds of city, and that conflict is more likely to occur in cities with historically weaker development, such as Yueqing. To avoid such conflict, systematic risk-management strategies should be established in these cities.","publish_time":"2017-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shan, Liping; Yu, Ann T.W.; Wu, Yuzhe","journal":"Habitat International","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cd90e93fb45e439abee32500b37b75ee4fe0afdd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124285.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0197397516305690; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.11.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397516305690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287707/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsxODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["types of cities","land acquisition conflict","rural conflict","representative cities","different Chinese cities","dynamics of conflict","high level of development","low level of development","Different types of risk","different risk-management strategies","weaker development","institutional level","substantial growth","experienced stable growth","systematic risk-management strategies","Yueqing","study","recent rapid economic growth","clear differences","rural environments","rapid urbanisation","major cause of urban","morphology","production mode","access","accurate insights","terms of property rights","resources","China","culture","Jiaxing","significant challenges","kinds of city","Analysis","century","findings"],"language":"en"},

Although people at the extremes of age have a greater risk of complications, influenza has been more frequently investigated in the elderly than in children, and inpatients than outpatients. Yearly vaccination with trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines is the main strategy to control influenza. Objectives Determine the clinical and molecular characteristics of influenza A and B infections in children and adolescents with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods A cohort of outpatient children and adolescents with ILI was followed for 20 months. Influenza was diagnosed with commercial multiplex PCR platforms. Results 179 patients had 277 episodes of ILI, being 79 episodes of influenza A and 20 episodes of influenza B. Influenza A and B cases were mild and had similar presentation. Phylogenetic tree of influenza B viruses showed that 91.6% belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, which is not included in trivalent vaccines. Conclusions Influenza A and B are often detected in children and adolescents with ILI episodes, with similar and mild presentation in outpatients. The mismatch between the circulating influenza viruses and the trivalent vaccine offered in Brazil may have contributed to the high frequency of influenza A and B in this population.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Machado, Clarisse M.; de Souza, Ana Carolina Mamana Fernandes; Romano, Camila Malta; dos Santos Freire, Wilton; Costa, \u00C2ngela Aparecida; Figueiredo, Walter Manso; Pannuti, Cl\u00E1udio S.; Luna, Expedito J.A.","journal":"The Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac1f17e17eb06992a4fcbdefb8caf8292ab05f7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110568.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1413867019304945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31951818/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1413867019304945; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2019.12.005","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyNDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ILI"],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["episodes of influenza","Conclusions Influenza","circulating influenza viruses","molecular characteristics of influenza","Abstract Introduction Influenza","high frequency of influenza","Phylogenetic tree of influenza B viruses","episodes of ILI","ILI episodes","B cases","B infections","adolescents","trivalent vaccines","cohort of outpatient children","similar presentation","mild presentation","outpatients","quadrivalent vaccines","greater risk of complications","extremes of age","main strategy","important cause of morbimortality","Yearly vaccination","commercial multiplex PCR platforms","Objectives","Brazil","Methods","inpatients","mismatch","illness","people","Results","Yamagata lineage","population","months"],"language":"en"},

There is currently not enough data in favour of danger or benefit from corticosteroids in COVID-19, so until this matter is resolved it is advisable to limit their indications to the most serious clinical pictures for which it is well established that this type of treatment has a positive impact on the progression of symptoms. In Grade V and VI Bell\u0027s palsy according to the House-Brackmann grading system, a week\u2019s course of oral corticosteroids is recommended. Corticosteroid therapy is also recommended in cases of sudden hearing loss of more than 60 dB, either in the form of intratympanic injections or a week\u2019s course of oral medication.

Their activation can elicit a strong humoral and cellular immune response as well as mucosal immunity. Therefore, the skin is a very attractive site for vaccination, and an intradermal application of antigen may be much more effective than a subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. However, the stratum corneum (SC) is a most effective barrier against the invasion of topically applied vaccines. Products which have reached the stage of clinical testing, avoid this problem by injecting the nano\u2010vaccine intradermally or by employing a barrier disrupting method and applying the vaccine to a relatively large skin area. Needle\u2010free vaccination is desirable from a number of aspects: ease of application, improved patient acceptance and less risk of infection among them. Nanocarriers can be designed in a way that they can overcome the SC. Also incorporation into nanocarriers protects instable antigen from degradation, improves uptake and processing by APCs, and facilitates endosomal escape and nuclear delivery of DNA vaccines. In addition, sustained release systems may build a depot in the tissue gradually releasing antigen which may avoid booster doses. Therefore, nanoformulations of vaccines for transcutaneous immunization are currently a very dynamic field of research. Among the huge variety of nanocarrier systems that are investigated hopes lie on ultra\u2010flexible liposomes, superfine rigid nanoparticles and nanocarriers, which are taken up by hair follicles. The potential and pitfalls associated with these three classes of carriers will be discussed.","publish_time":"2012-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hansen, Steffi; Lehr, Claus\u2010Michael","journal":"Microb Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cdb6748d297a7329b905186e48611af6d932b62f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3815776.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-7915.2011.00284.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21854553/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjsyODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Nanocarriers","instable antigen","intradermal application of antigen","APCs","effective barrier","nanoformulations of vaccines","applied vaccines","ease of application","nuclear delivery of DNA vaccines","free vaccination","sustained release systems","large skin area","huge variety of nanocarrier systems","ultra\u2010flexible liposomes","improved patient acceptance","superfine rigid nanoparticles","endosomal escape","cellular immune response","number of aspects","hopes","depot","uptake","degradation","transcutaneous immunization","problem","processing","cells","invasion","mucosal immunity","risk of infection","living epidermis","attractive site","stage of clinical testing","dynamic field of research","intramuscular injection","addition","Needle","incorporation","pitfalls","stratum corneum","activation","booster doses","tissue","method","classes of carriers","hair follicles","potential","Products","way"],"language":"en"},

Cost-effectiveness analysis is required to assist decision-makers evaluating alternative healthcare worker (HCW) mask/respirator strategies. This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of N95 respirators and medical masks for protecting HCWs in Beijing, China. METHODS: We developed a cost-effectiveness analysis model utilising efficacy and resource use data from two cluster randomised clinical trials assessing various mask/respirator strategies conducted in HCWs in Level 2 and 3 Beijing hospitals for the 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310 influenza seasons. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per clinical respiratory illness (CRI) case prevented. We used a societal perspective which included intervention costs, the healthcare costs of CRI in HCWs and absenteeism costs. RESULTS: The incremental cost to prevent a CRI case with continuous use of N95 respirators when compared to medical masks ranged from US $490\u2013$1230 (approx. 3000-7600 RMB). One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that the CRI attack rate and intervention effectiveness had the greatest impact on cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The determination of cost-effectiveness for mask/respirator strategies will depend on the willingness to pay to prevent a CRI case in a HCW, which will vary between countries. In the case of a highly pathogenic pandemic, respirator use in HCWs would likely be a cost-effective intervention.","publish_time":"2017-07-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mukerji, Shohini; MacIntyre, C.

Most of the highly pathogenic and emerging viruses are RNA genome-based viruses, which can give rise to zoonotic and epidemic diseases or cause viral hemorrhagic fever. As viral RNA is located in the same compartment as host RNA, PRRs in the cytosol have to discriminate between viral and endogenous RNA by virtue of their structure or modification. This challenging task is taken on by the homologous cytosolic DExD/H-box family helicases RIG-I and MDA5, which control the innate immune response to most RNA viruses. This review focuses on the molecular basis for RIG-I like receptor (RLR) activation by synthetic and natural ligands and will discuss controversial ligand definitions.","publish_time":"2013-11-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Schlee, Martin","journal":"Immunobiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0889153e8bd8e83afad8e49fe4ba3ceb62c7eba5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114584.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171298513001204; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171298513001204; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2013.06.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23896194/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjszNzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["RNA viruses","viral RNA","immune receptors","immune cells","innate immune response","innate immune system","RNA genome-based viruses","host RNA","endogenous RNA","emerging viruses","modification","viral hemorrhagic fever","PRRs","location of viral nucleic acids","Detection of pathogens","unusual structure","molecular patterns","molecular basis","neighboring cells","pattern recognition receptors","H-box family helicases RIG","natural ligands","epidemic diseases","sense microbe","homologous cytosolic DExD","activation","RLR","rise","MDA5","virtue","intracellular defense mechanisms","secretion of cytokines","chemokines","compartment","controversial ligand definitions","MAMPs","review","Abstract","challenging task"],"language":"en"},

Because of the rising antimicrobial resistance rates and adverse effects of childhood antibiotic use on the developing microbiome, rational prescribing of antibiotics for CAP is important. This review summarizes and critically reflects on the available evidence for the epidemiology, etiology and antimicrobial management of childhood CAP. Larger prospective studies on antimicrobial management derive mostly from low- or middle-income countries as they have the highest burden of CAP. Optimal antimicrobial management depends on the etiology, age, local vaccination policies and resistance patterns. As long as non-rapid surrogate markers are used to distinguish viral- from bacterial pneumonia, the management is probably suboptimal. For a young child with signs of non-severe pneumonia (with or without wheezing), watchful waiting is recommended because of probable viral etiology. For children with more severe CAP with fever, a five-day oral amoxicillin course would be the first choice therapy and dosage will depend on local resistance rates. There is no clear evidence yet for superiority of a macrolide-based regimen for all ages. For cases with CAP requiring hospitalization, several studies have shown that narrow-spectrum IV beta-lactam therapy is as effective as a broad-spectrum cephalosporin therapy. For most severe disease, broad-spectrum therapy with or without a macrolide is suggested. In case of empyema, rapid IV-to-oral switch seems to be equivalent to prolonged IV treatment.","publish_time":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tramper-Stranders, Gerdien A.","journal":"Paediatric Respiratory Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/65077ab65c5086aa6809eb74ea101bf5c28bfa99.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106165.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28844414/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054217300702; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054217300702; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prrv.2017.06.013","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Abstract Community","CAP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["antimicrobial management of childhood","severe CAP","Optimal antimicrobial management","broad-spectrum therapy","rising antimicrobial resistance rates","choice therapy","rapid IV","local resistance rates","broad-spectrum cephalosporin therapy","signs of non-severe pneumonia","probable viral etiology","resistance patterns","beta-lactam therapy","bacterial pneumonia","severe disease","prolonged IV treatment","leading cause of childhood morbidity","oral switch","non-rapid surrogate markers","available evidence","clear evidence","adverse effects of childhood antibiotic use","Larger prospective studies","local vaccination policies","macrolide-based regimen","five-day oral amoxicillin course","developing microbiome","fever","rational prescribing of antibiotics","highest burden of","superiority","dosage","epidemiology","watchful waiting","narrow-spectrum","young child","wheezing","middle-income countries","ages","case of empyema","hospitalization","Abstract Community","children","cases","review"],"language":"en"},

The etiology of severe pneumonia is complex and includes the newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Since 2012, the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) has required screening for MERS-CoV for all cases of severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. We aimed to screen Hajj pilgrims admitted to healthcare facilities in 2013 with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) for MERS-CoV and to determine other etiologies. Methods Sputum samples were collected from all pilgrims admitted to 15 healthcare facilities in the cities of Makkah and Medina, Saudi Arabia, who were diagnosed with severe CAP on admission, presenting with bilateral pneumonia. The medical records were reviewed to collect information on age, gender, nationality, and patient outcome. Samples were screened for MERS-CoV by PCR, and a respiratory multiplex array was used to detect up to 22 other viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Results Thirty-eight patients met the inclusion criteria; they were predominantly elderly (mean age 58.6 years, range 25\u201383 years) and male (68.4%), and all were from developing countries. Fourteen of the 38 patients died (36.8%). MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the samples. Other respiratory pathogens were detected in 26 (68.4%) samples. Of these, bacterial pathogens were detected in 84.6% (22/26) and viruses in 80.7% (21/26). Twenty-one (80.7%) samples were positive for more than one respiratory pathogen and 17 (65.3%) were positive for both bacteria and viruses. The most common respiratory virus was human rhinovirus, detected in 57.7% of the positive samples, followed by influenza A virus (23.1%) and human coronaviruses (19.2%). Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the predominant bacteria, detected in 57.7% and 53.8%, respectively, of the positive samples, followed by Moraxella catarrhalis (36.4%). Conclusions MERS-CoV was not the cause of severe CAP in any of the hospitalized pilgrims investigated. However we identified a variety of other respiratory pathogens in the sputum of this small number of patients. This indicates that the etiology of severe CAP in Hajj is complex with implications regarding its management.","publish_time":"2014-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Memish, Ziad A.; Almasri, Malak; Turkestani, Abdulhafeez; Al-Shangiti, Ali M.; Yezli, Saber","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/216a12289d34dd8c0febe000a1de70c1c8b634c8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110543.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24970703/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971214015355; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971214015355; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.06.003","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus","Streptococcus","Moraxella"],"organizations":["Saudi Ministry of Health"],"locations":["Middle East","Makkah"],"keyphrases":["positive samples","etiology of severe pneumonia","Conclusions MERS-CoV","bacterial respiratory pathogens","cause of severe CAP","cases of severe pneumonia","etiology of severe CAP","severe community","common respiratory virus","Methods Sputum samples","bilateral pneumonia","respiratory multiplex array","Hajj pilgrims","bacterial pathogens","Summary Background Pneumonia","emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","healthcare facilities","years","hospitalized pilgrims","small number of patients","leading cause of hospital admission","Saudi Arabia","human rhinovirus","mean age","predominant bacteria","human coronaviruses","Saudi Ministry of Health","cities of Makkah","annual Islamic pilgrimage","information","Streptococcus pneumoniae","gender","nationality","MoH","PCR","Medina","inclusion criteria","screening","Haemophilus influenzae","patient outcome","Results","implications","Moraxella catarrhalis","hospitalization","medical records","variety","developing countries","management","male","etiologies"],"language":"en"},

After IB vaccination and infection, systemic and upper respiratory tract (URT), humoral and cell-mediated immunity (CMI), are stimulated. The level of this stimulation correlates with the level of protection against IB. RESULTS: We\u2019ve investigated the development of URT and systemic, cell-mediated and humoral immunity in commercial broiler chickens vaccinated with Ma5 and/or 4/91 strains at hatch day. We\u2019ve demonstrated that the group vaccinated with Ma5 and 4/91 strain simultaneously developed the most desirable immunity which reflects the level of CD8(\u002B) T cells stimulation in spleen and Harderian gland, as well as the level of IgA and IgY in URT washings and serum and their cross-reactivity with 7 IBV strains.

The aim of this narrative review is to describe the evidence concerning the role that infections or dysbiosis plays in the epigenetic control of gene expression in SS patients and their possible involvement in B cell lymphomagenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases and selected a total of 92 articles published during the last 25 years that describe experimental and clinical studies of the potential associations of microbiota and epigenetic aberrations with the risk of B cell lymphoma in SS patients. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The genetic background of SS patients is characterized by the hyperexpression of genes that are mainly involved in regulating the innate and adaptive immune responses and oncogenesis. In addition, salivary gland epithelial cells and lymphocytes both have an altered epigenetic background that enhances the activation of proinflammatory and survival pathways. Dysbiosis or chronic latent infections may tune the immune response and modify the cell epigenetic machinery in such a way as to give B lymphocytes an activated or transformed phenotype. It is also worth noting that transposable integrated retroelements may participate in the pathogenesis of SS and B cell lymphomagenesis by inducing DNA breaks, modulating cell gene expression, or generating aberrant transcripts that chronically stimulate the immune system. CONCLUSIONS: Microorganisms may epigenetically modify target cells and induce their transcriptome to generate an activated or transformed phenotype. The occurrence of lymphoma in more than 15% of SS patients may be the end result of a combination of genetics, epigenetics, and dysbiosis or latent infections.","publish_time":"2019-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Talotta, Rossella; Sarzi-Puttini, Piercarlo; Atzeni, Fabiola","journal":"J Immunol Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c3e1a43f0e199876d4bd9ff787e1911fd5cfaa6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6339763.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30723750/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/8567364","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["B cell lymphomagenesis","B cell transformation","pathogenesis of SS","risk of B cell lymphoma","cell epigenetic machinery","B lymphocytes","genetic background of SS patients","dysbiosis","modulating cell gene expression","epigenetic aberrations","risk of lymphomagenesis","altered epigenetic background","epigenetic control of gene expression","chronic latent infections","immune system","phenotype","adaptive immune responses","target cells","occurrence of lymphoma","pathogenesis of Sj\u00F6gren\u0027s syndrome","salivary gland epithelial cells","DNA breaks","potential associations of microbiota","possible involvement","clinical studies","activation of proinflammatory","epigenetics","end result","aberrant transcripts","combination of genetics","PubMed","total","Google Scholar databases","years","mechanisms","addition","evidence","oncogenesis","DISCUSSION","steps","transposable integrated retroelements","narrative review","survival pathways","Microorganisms","RESULTS","transcriptome","order","role","METHODS","aim","CONCLUSIONS","articles","hyperexpression of genes","MATERIALS","INTRODUCTION"],"language":"en"},

We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including ZINC drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and papain like protease (PLpro) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used anti-viral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further in vitro and in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-2, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.","publish_time":"2020-02-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Canrong; Liu, Yang; Yang, Yueying; Zhang, Peng; Zhong, Wu; Wang, Yali; Wang, Qiqi; Xu, Yang; Li, Mingxue; Li, Xingzhou; Zheng, Mengzhu; Chen, Lixia; Li, Hua","journal":"Acta Pharm Sin B","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d54623f8b642ddf2525503cd5d4cad880e4d8e39.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f726b9f9f1737e712581e2f613a68fed62a48eca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102550.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292689/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211383520302999; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2020.02.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383520302999","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","Possible targets","studies of SARS","drug repositioning","human targets","ZINC drug database","new insights","possible new strategies","new lead compounds","screening results of important targets","time consuming process of new drug development","potential drugs","protease","coronavirus infections","structures","proteins","ongoing clinical studies","database of natural products","anti-viral drugs","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","clinical trials","certain target","virtual ligand screening","RdRp","Spike","compound libraries","solution","papain","CLpro","chymotrypsin","total","market","epidemic of sudden infectious diseases","registered therapies","study","genes","tens of thousands","PLpro","coronaviruses","homology modeling","deaths","addition"],"language":"en"},

However, this phenomenon may be associated with drug transporters. We investigated the effect of saikosaponin b2 (SSb2; the main component of VBRB) on the activity and expression of different drug transporters in both normal cells and those that overexpress the transporter. Main methods: The activities of transporters were analyzed by concentration of their cellular substrates. Concentrations of colchicine (substrate of Pgp and MRP1) and cisplatin (substrate of OCT2 and MRP2) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The concentration of rhodamine B was determined by flow cytometry. The expression of transporter gene and protein were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Key findings: SSb2 increased colchicine efflux in HEK293 cells by primarily increasing Mrp1 activity, independent of gene and protein expression. SSb2 enhanced Mrp2 function and increased cisplatin efflux in BRL3A cells by upregulating Mrp2 gene expression, with a marginal effect on Pgp in normal cells. SSb2 increased OCT2 activity in OCT2-HEK293 cells by increasing the expression of OCT2 protein and mRNA; however, SSb2 inhibited MRP2 activity in MRP2-HEK293 cells by decreasing MRP2 protein expression, and decreased Pgp and MRP1 activity in Pgp- and MRP1-HEK293 cells. Significance: SSb2 might potentially be the key active component of VBRB that enhances the hepatotargeting of anticancer drugs through the inhibition of multidrug resistance-associated drug transporters (Pgp, MRP1, and MRP2) in an environment-dependent manner.","publish_time":"2019-08-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Ya; Feng, Limin; Liu, Lijuan; Zhao, Ruizhi","journal":"Life Sciences","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0cbd1447be1208e6013a8af7a24920b7899a7abf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094655.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320519304837; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320519304837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31194994/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.116557","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Radix Bupleuri"],"organizations":["VBRB"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MRP2-HEK293 cells","MRP2 protein expression","Mrp1 activity","MRP1-HEK293 cells","SSb2 inhibited MRP2 activity","OCT2-HEK293 cells","SSb2 increased OCT2 activity","expression of OCT2 protein","normal cells","upregulating Mrp2 gene expression","BRL3A cells","SSb2 enhanced Mrp2 function","expression of transporter gene","substrate of Pgp","expression of different drug transporters","activity of anticancer drugs","SSb2 increased colchicine efflux","decreased Pgp","substrate of OCT2","activities of transporters","increased cisplatin efflux","main component of VBRB","independent of gene","inhibition of multidrug resistance-associated drug transporters","key active component of VBRB","hepatotargeting of anticancer drugs","marginal effect","Key findings","Concentrations of colchicine","Main methods","effect of saikosaponin b2","concentration of rhodamine B","Vinegar-baked Radix Bupleuri","mRNA","qRT-PCR","liver","Abstract Aims","Western blotting analysis","high-performance liquid chromatography","flow cytometry","HPLC","environment-dependent manner","hepatic distribution","cellular substrates","phenomenon","Significance"],"language":"en"},

The herd was established by caesarean section and has been closed to all new animal material, with the exception of semen for artificial insemination (AI). The study comprised serum samples from the SPF-herd over a 10-year period (n=109) and a close monitoring of animals in the herd during the period after the EE outbreak. Serum samples from conventional boars at the AI-station servicing the herd were also included (n=9). All serum samples were tested for antibodies to porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2). In addition, 3-week-old piglets from three litters (n=24) farrowed close after the initial EE outbreak were closely monitored for clinical signs of skin disease, sampled for Staphylococcus hyicus, tested for antibodies to porcine parvovirus and in sequentially collected serum samples tested for interferon-\u03B1 (IFN-\u03B1) and interleukin-6. The PVC-2 serology showed that animals in the herd were sero-negative at least until 2 months prior to the EE outbreak. During the period close after the EE outbreak the animals showed varying levels of antibodies to PCV-2 but all the tested animals had sero-converted 4 months later. The AI boars were also sero-positive to PCV-2 at the time of the EE outbreak. Animals in the SPF-herd remained sero-positive to PCV-2 during the following 7 years. In the monitored litters, one piglet had clinical EE and 15 piglets displayed defined erythemas on the abdomen. Fourteen of the piglets also had IFN-\u03B1 in serum on one or more occasions during the study, indicating viral activity among the animals. S. hyicus was isolated from all of the piglets from the earliest sampling point (3 days of age) and onwards, irrespective of clinical signs. PCV-2 was isolated from lymphnode tissue collected from one of the EE affected pigs. Further, increases in the number of stillborn piglets, small litters (\u003C6 piglets) and repeat breeders could be correlated to the time of PCV-2 sero-conversion. Coincidence of active viral infection and sero-conversion to PCV-2 points to the virus as the cause of the EE outbreak and reproductive disturbances.","publish_time":"2002-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wattrang, Eva; McNeilly, Francis; Allan, Gordon M.; Greko, Christina; Fossum, Caroline; Wallgren, Per","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ef74b0c3029bddee504fb158a479b432e1711872.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117192.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811350200024X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811350200024X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["clinical EE","initial EE outbreak","tested animals","serum samples","time of PCV","week-old piglets","sero-conversion","sero-positive","Swedish SPF-herd","sero-negative","close monitoring of animals","number of stillborn piglets","period close","outbreak of exudative epidermitis","AI boars","IFN-\u03B1","monitored litters","small litters","interferon-\u03B1","cause of disease","AI-station","clinical signs of skin disease","study","year period","months","varying levels of antibodies","conventional boars","viral activity","porcine parvovirus","porcine circovirus","Staphylococcus hyicus","Coincidence of active viral infection","exception of semen","survey","earliest sampling point","defined erythemas","artificial insemination","points","indications","days of age","new animal material","reproductive disturbances","abdomen","occasions","serology","repeat breeders","PVC","caesarean section","interleukin","addition","lymphnode tissue","years","pigs"],"language":"en"},

These results provide insights into understanding the immunological characteristics of spike protein and the development of subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV.","publish_time":"2004-03-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zeng, Fanya; Chow, Ken Yan Ching; Hon, Chung Chau; Law, Ka Man; Yip, Chi Wai; Chan, Kwok Hung; Peiris, Joseph S.Malik; Leung, Frederick Chi Ching","journal":"Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e711cafe8a0e573a41064b78e9cbf54a375ac886.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111006.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X04002104; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X04002104","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs0ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["S1 subunit","S1 fragment","matured S1 protein","S2 specific antibodies","neutralized SARS-CoV","S2 subunits","CoV spike protein","capable of eliciting SARS-CoV specific antibodies","elicitation of SARS","secreting forms of S1","immunological characteristics of SARS","plasmids","mouse antibodies","immunological characteristics of spike protein","N-terminus","mice","development of subunit vaccines","important immunogenic determinant","region immediate","host cell docking","various S gene fragments","possible role","Th1-mediated antibody isotype","entry","residues","interesting finding","insights","results","addition"],"language":"en"},

This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of circulating influenza viruses, causing SARI, and reported to the EMFLU during July 2016 to June 2018. METHODS: Data included in this study were collected by 15 countries of the Region from 110 SARI sentinel surveillance sites over two influenza seasons. RESULTS: A total of 40,917 cases of SARI were included in the study. Most cases [20,551 (50.2%)] were less than 5 years of age. Influenza virus was detected in 3995 patients, 2849 (11.8%) were influenza A and 1146 (4.8%) were influenza B. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant circulating subtype with 1666 cases (58.5%). Other than influenza, respiratory syncytial virus was the most common respiratory infection circulating, with 277 cases (35.9%). CONCLUSION: Influenza viruses cause a high number of severe respiratory infections in EMR. It is crucial for the countries to continue improving their influenza surveillance capacity in order detect any unusual influenza activity or new strain that may cause a pandemic.","publish_time":"2019-07-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elhakim, Mohamed; Hafiz Rasooly, Mohammad; Fahim, Manal; Sheikh Ali, Sami; Haddad, Nadine; Cherkaoui, Imad; Hjaija, Diaa; Nadeem, Shazia; Assiri, Abdullah; Aljifri, Alanoud; Elkholy, Amgad; Barakat, Amal; Shrestha, Bhagawan; Abubakar, Abdinasir; Malik, Sk.

In contrast, the related lectin LSECtin does not recognize mannose-rich glycans and interacts with a more restricted spectrum of viruses. Here, we analyzed whether these lectins differ in their mode of ligand engagement. LSECtin and DC-SIGNR, which we found to be co-expressed by liver, lymph node and bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial cells, bound to soluble Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) with comparable affinities. Similarly, LSECtin, DC-SIGN and the Langerhans cell-specific lectin Langerin readily bound to soluble human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) GP. However, only DC-SIGN captured HIV-1 particles, indicating that binding to soluble GP is not necessarily predictive of binding to virion-associated GP. Capture of EBOV-GP by LSECtin triggered ligand internalization, suggesting that LSECtin like DC-SIGN might function as an antigen uptake receptor. However, the intracellular fate of lectin\u2013ligand complexes might differ. Thus, exposure to low-pH medium, which mimics the acidic luminal environment in endosomes/lysosomes, released ligand bound to DC-SIGN/R but had no effect on LSECtin interactions with ligand. Our results reveal important differences between pathogen capture by DC-SIGN/R and LSECtin and hint towards different biological functions of these lectins.","publish_time":"2008-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gramberg, Thomas; Soilleux, Elizabeth; Fisch, Tanja; Lalor, Patricia F.; Hofmann, Heike; Wheeldon, Sophie; Cotterill, Andrew; Wegele, Anja; Winkler, Thomas; Adams, David H.; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/45e64c5963b9f16e654cb31ff11561e1a9a420c3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103327.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682207007544; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682207007544","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs1MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["termed DC-SIGN","DC-SIGNR","calcium-dependent lectins DC-SIGN","soluble GP","LSECtin interactions","related lectin LSECtin","EBOV-GP","ligand internalization","ligand complexes","virion-associated GP","mode of ligand engagement","Capture of EBOV","HIV","soluble Ebola virus glycoprotein","intracellular fate of lectin","soluble human immunodeficiency virus type","pathogen capture","predictive of binding","variety of viruses","Langerhans cell-specific lectin Langerin","high-mannose carbohydrates","mannose-rich glycans","restricted spectrum of viruses","lymph node","bone marrow sinusoidal endothelial cells","lysosomes","hint","different biological functions","acidic luminal environment","liver","endosomes","important differences","effect","low-pH medium","results","particles","exposure","comparable affinities","contrast","antigen uptake receptor"],"language":"en"},

This renewed interest follows the re-emergence of communicable diseases, largely thought to have disappeared and therefore irrelevant to modern day practitioners. The 2003 SARS outbreak particularly presented propitious circumstances for reconsidering this issue. This study seeks to characterize the views of individuals on the nature and limits of this duty. The authors employed qualitative methods to gather lay and expert perspectives. Individual interviews were conducted with 67 participants consisting of HCPs, spiritual leaders, regulators, and members of the public from the greater Toronto area. Participants\u2019 views were analyzed and organized according to three main themes, constituting a framework that combines micro-, meso-, and macro-level structures and processes: the scope of obligations of HCPs, the roles of health care institutions, and the broader social context, respectively. Our data suggest that the duty to care must be placed in a wider context to include considerations that transcend individual provider obligations. It thus follows, based on our data, that the duty to care cannot be left to personal choice or an appeal to morality based on an ethic derived entirely from individual obligations. The micro-meso-macro analytical framework that we have developed can guide the articulation of accepted norms of duty to care during epidemics and the development of policy for public health crises. It can also enhance the focus of our current expectations of HCPs\u2019 duty during epidemics. This can be achieved by informing regulatory bodies, collaborating with policy makers and engaging the public.","publish_time":"2007-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bensimon, C\u00E9cile M.; Tracy, C.

Typically characterized by annual seasonal epidemics, sporadic pandemic outbreaks involve influenza A virus strains of zoonotic origin. The WHO estimates that annual epidemics of influenza result in ~1 billion infections, 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and 300,000\u2013500,000 deaths. The severity of pandemic influenza depends on multiple factors, including the virulence of the pandemic virus strain and the level of pre-existing immunity. The most severe influenza pandemic, in 1918, resulted in \u003E40 million deaths worldwide. Influenza vaccines are formulated every year to match the circulating strains, as they evolve antigenically owing to antigenic drift. Nevertheless, vaccine efficacy is not optimal and is dramatically low in the case of an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating virus strain. Antiviral agents that target the influenza virus enzyme neuraminidase have been developed for prophylaxis and therapy. However, the use of these antivirals is still limited.

The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and containment measures. In this article, we describe the scientific and technological issues faced during the development and deployment of a flexible and readily deployable web tool capable of coping with the requirements of different countries for data collection, during either a public health emergency or an ordinary influenza season. Even though the system is based on previous successful experience, the implementation in each new country represented a separate scientific challenge. Only after more than 5 years of development are the existing platforms based on a plug-and-play tool that can be promptly deployed in any country wishing to be part of the Influenzanet network, now composed of The Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Italy, the UK, France, Sweden, Spain, Ireland, and Denmark.","publish_time":"2014-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Paolotti, D.; Carnahan, A.; Colizza, V.; Eames, K.; Edmunds, J.; Gomes, G.; Koppeschaar, C.; Rehn, M.; Smallenburg, R.; Turbelin, C.; Van Noort, S.; Vespignani, A.","journal":"Clin Microbiol Infect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/098aa6b7a46911a1d02a0eb1eadfa73f082b04bc.json; document_parses/pdf_json/4e2cb0a54b6fa519a52d293d02bf8b1f3e71eeac.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128292.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-0691.12477; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14601889; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14601889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24350723/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["Europe","Portugal","The Netherlands","Belgium","France","Sweden","Denmark"],"keyphrases":["web-based surveillance system","web surveys","distribution of influenza","large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure","different European countries","ordinary influenza season","state-of-the-art influenza surveillance systems","European-wide consortium","Portugal","new country","Netherlands","population","deployable web tool capable of coping","requirements of different countries","public health emergency","public health emergencies","data collection","innovative information","real-time information","lack of symptoms","years of development","Influenzanet network","separate scientific challenge","data-driven forecast models","communication technology approach","illness cases","Spain","France","UK","implementation","global trends","Italy","volunteers","previous successful experience","devising mitigation","Ireland","Sweden","existing platforms","impact","deployment","limitations","earlier efforts","week","technological issues","containment measures","allocation of resources","plug","Belgium","participation","Denmark","article"],"language":"en"},

At present, there is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine for COVID-19. The pathogenic infectivity of the virus requires the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein to bind the host cell receptor, angiontensin converting enzyme (ACE2). While the binding to host cell receptor is the first step of infection, the entrance of the virus into the cell needs the cleavage of S1\u2013S2 subunits to expose S2 for fusion to cell membrane via host proteases including cathepsins, cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) proteases, furin, trypsin and factor Xa. Previous in vitro studies have shown that factor Xa inhibition can decrease viral infectivity. We suppose that host cell proteases including furin (as expressed highly in lungs), factor Xa and cathepsin are possible targets to decrease viral burden, therefore unfractioned heparin and low molecular weight heparin-LMWH (specifically dalteparin and tinzaparin for their anti inflammatory action) can be potential inhibitors of multiple endoproteases involved in virus infectivity. Our hypothesis needs to be tested in in vitro and clinical studies, however as we are in an urgent situation as the burden of SARS-CoV2 is increasing all around the world, we recommend the usage of unfractioned heparin or LMWH in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospitalized patients with the risk\u2013benefit judgement of the clinician. Whether our hypothesis is clinically applicable and successful in decreasing viral infection will be evaluated for further studies.","publish_time":"2020-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Belen-Apak, F.B.; Sarialioglu, F.","journal":"Med Hypotheses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b0f0a541b266e2974f0e645b201c7558545d674e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/95756463b167465481cd48a79f88b164c62748fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169882.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32335456/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720305569?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720305569; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109743","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs2MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TMPRSS","LMWH","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host cell proteases","host cell receptor","host proteases","cell membrane","viral infectivity","virus infectivity","viral burden","viral infection","factor Xa inhibition","cell surface transmembrane protease","usage of unfractioned heparin","furin","COVID","pathogenic infectivity","world","clinical studies","hypothesis","low molecular weight heparin-LMWH","non-ICU","S2 subunits","cleavage of S1","burden of SARS","S1 subunit","step of infection","cathepsins","TMPRSS","serine","fusion","intensive care unit","risk","patients","dalteparin","possible targets","potential inhibitors of multiple endoproteases","anti inflammatory action","tinzaparin","angiontensin","enzyme","protein","trypsin","specific antiviral drug","benefit judgement","outbreak","spike","lungs","entrance","tremendous efforts","Novel Coronavirus","drugs","clinician","urgent situation","ACE2","CoV2","binding","vaccines","present","disease"],"language":"en"},

A dynamic G-quadruplex forming region in the HIV-1 LTR promoter represses HIV-1 transcription when in the folded conformation. This activity is enhanced by nucleolin, which induces and stabilizes the HIV-1 LTR G-quadruplexes. In this work by a combined pull-down/mass spectrometry approach, we consistently found hnRNP A2/B1 as an additional LTR-G-quadruplex interacting protein. Surface plasmon resonance confirmed G-quadruplex specificity over linear sequences and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis indicated that hnRNP A2/B1 is able to efficiently unfold the LTR G-quadruplexes. Evaluation of the thermal stability of the LTR G-quadruplexes in different-length oligonucleotides showed that the protein is fit to be most active in the LTR full-length environment. When hnRNP A2/B1 was silenced in cells, LTR activity decreased, indicating that the protein acts as a HIV-1 transcription activator.

In Ireland, the power to detain and isolate probable sources of infectious disease is found in the Health Act 1947. The objective of this study was to describe the use of the power to detain, and to examine relevant legal implications. Study design Cohort survey. Methods Respiratory and infectious disease physicians practising in the public sector were invited to complete a self-administered postal questionnaire. Results Of the 44 clinicians surveyed, 33 responded, representing a total of 356 years of specialist practice (mean 10.8 years). Although 70% of respondents had made use of threats of formal detention in dealing with non-compliant patients, only one formal detention under statutory powers was identified. Infrastructural and legal concerns with the use of detention were common. There was widespread support for a broadening of the range of additional public health powers, including a power of prolonged detention in the setting of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. Conclusion Detention and isolation of non-compliant tuberculosis patients remains in active use. Physicians detaining, or threatening to detain, patients continue to expose themselves to legal liability because of the outdated legal framework underlying those powers.","publish_time":"2009-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Duffy, S.

All isolates could not be identified for known viral pathogens by routine diagnostic assays. They were pooled into 8 groups of 5\u20136 isolates to reduce the sequencing cost. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted for each group of mixed samples, and the proposed data analysis pipeline was used to identify viral pathogens in these mixed samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was individually conducted for each of these 42 isolates depending on the predicted viral types in each group. Two isolates remained unknown after these tests. Moreover, iteration mapping was implemented for each of these 2 isolates, and predicted human parechovirus (HPeV) in both. In summary, our NGS pipeline detected the following viruses among the 42 isolates: 29 human rhinoviruses (HRVs), 10 HPeVs, 1 human adenovirus (HAdV), 1 echovirus and 1 rotavirus. We then focused on the 10 identified Taiwanese HPeVs because of their reported clinical significance over HRVs. Their genomes were assembled and their genetic diversity was explored. One novel 6-bp deletion was found in one HPeV-1 virus. In terms of nucleotide heterogeneity, 64 genetic variants were detected from these HPeVs using the mapped NGS reads. Most importantly, a recombination event was found between our HPeV-3 and a known HPeV-4 strain in the database. Similar event was detected in the other HPeV-3 strains in the same clade of the phylogenetic tree. These findings demonstrated that the proposed NGS data analysis pipeline identified unknown viruses from the mixed clinical samples, revealed their genetic identity and variants, and characterized their genetic features in terms of viral evolution.","publish_time":"2016-03-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gong, Yu-Nong; Chen, Guang-Wu; Yang, Shu-Li; Lee, Ching-Ju; Shih, Shin-Ru; Tsao, Kuo-Chien","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9301787667eb36e650623c8dc753399f3e1b4b7c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4795770.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26986479/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151495","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NGS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive isolates","NGS pipeline","known HPeV","genetic variants","viral pathogens","mixed clinical samples","group of mixed samples","proposed NGS data analysis pipeline","genetic features","genetic identity","genetic diversity","mapped NGS","terms of viral evolution","predicted viral types","proposed data analysis pipeline","unknown viruses","Taiwanese HPeVs","HRVs","human adenovirus","human rhinoviruses","human parechovirus","following viruses","generation sequencing","recombination event","sequencing cost","Similar event","reported clinical significance","terms of nucleotide heterogeneity","PCR","enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","ELISA","CPE","routine diagnostic assays","HAdV","Polymerase chain reaction","cytopathic effect","clade","bp deletion","findings","phylogenetic tree","novel","genomes","strains","database","tests","summary","iteration mapping","rotavirus","groups"],"language":"en"},

Most crocodilians grow to be larger than other reptile species and, therefore, have significant space requirements. Like most animals requiring an aquatic environment, crocodilians need water that is clean and free of disease. Crocodilians have a true hard palate in the roof of the mouth that ends caudally in a soft palate. This soft palate has a ventral flap which is referred to as the velum palati. The respiratory system of crocodilians consists of well-developed lungs benefiting from a very effective inspiration aided by the intercostal muscles and the septum post hepaticum. Crocodilians have a four-chambered heart as opposed to the three-chambered heart found in other reptiles and amphibians. The temperature and humidity requirements for crocodilians in captivity vary with the species. An understanding of crocodilian biology and natural history is needed to try and duplicate their natural environment. An important consideration is the allowance of circadian variations in light cycle and temperatures to mimic their natural environment. This is not the case in many commercial operations, where they are maintained at a fairly constant temperature and humidity to achieve faster growth.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nevarez, Javier","journal":"Manual of Exotic Pet Practice","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9500b0e0522a9fdd1a9d8b4f4c298f1565c5ffb5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7152205.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416001195500093; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781416001195500093","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["respiratory system of crocodilians","natural environment","soft palate","humidity requirements","natural history","aquatic environment","chambered heart","true hard palate","constant temperature","reptile species","significant space requirements","allowance of circadian variations","intercostal muscles","physiology","temperatures","general overview","light cycle","anatomy","well-developed lungs","water","effective inspiration","chapter","septum post hepaticum","understanding of crocodilian biology","roof","treatment methodology","captivity","Publisher Summary","important consideration","faster growth","reptiles","ventral flap","mouth","animals","free of disease","case","commercial operations","amphibians","velum palati"],"language":"en"},

Methods: We identified patients from the two public hospitals in Vitoria who were admitted to ICU with confirmed infection by SARS-CoV-2. Data reported here were available in March 31th, 2020. Mortality was assessed in those who completed 7-days of ICU stay. Results: We identified 48 patients (27 males) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age of patients was 63 [51-75] years. Symptoms began a median of 7 [5-12] days before ICU admission. The most common comorbidities identified were obesity (n = 48%), arterial hypertension (n = 44%) and chronic lung disease (n = 37%). All patients were admitted by hypoxemic respiratory failure and none received non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Forty-five (94%) underwent intubation, 3 HFNT, 1 (2%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22 (49%) required prone position. After 15 days, 14/45 (31%) intubated patients died (13% within one week), 10 (22%) were extubated, and 21/45 (47%) underwent mechanical ventilation. Six patients had documented co-infection. Procalcitonin plasma above 0.5 \u00B5g/L was associated with 16% vs. 19% (p = 0.78) risk of death after 7 days. Conclusion: This early experience with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain suggests that a strategy of right oxygenation avoiding non-invasive mechanical ventilation was life-saving. Seven-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 requiring intubation was lower than 15%, with 80% of patients still requiring mechanical ventilation. After 15 days of ICU admission, half of patients remained intubated, whereas one third died.","publish_time":"2020-04-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Barrasa, Helena; Rello, Jordi; Tejada, Sofia; Mart\u00EDn, Alejandro; Balziskueta, Goiatz; Vinuesa, Cristina; Fern\u00E1ndez-Miret, Borja; Villagra, Ana; Vallejo, Ana; Sebasti\u00E1n, Ana San; Caba\u00F1es, Sara; Iribarren, Sebasti\u00E1n; Fonseca, Fernando; Maynar, Javier","journal":"Anaesth Crit Care Pain Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5c332521745f3bbcbbf05fc1fa4c83c88390c1ce.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352556820300643?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352556820300643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32278670/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accpm.2020.04.001","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ICU"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["intubated patients","half of patients","age of patients","confirmed SARS-CoV","days of ICU admission","non-invasive mechanical ventilation","Community transmission of SARS","confirmed infection","Vitoria","Spain","Median","intubation","co-infection","day mortality","strategy of right oxygenation","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","capacity","IQR","hypoxemic respiratory failure","interquartile range","intensive care unit","Abstract Purpose","early experience","life","males","chronic lung disease","ECMO","common comorbidities","obesity","risk of death","Conclusion","public hospitals","arterial hypertension","Procalcitonin plasma","\u00B5g","Data","prone position","Symptoms","HFNT","Methods","Results","years","week"],"language":"en"},

This study describes the assessment of the antiviral potential of nitric oxide (NO) against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strain Frankfurt-1 replicating in African Green Monkey (Vero E6) cells. Results: Two organic NO donor compounds, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), were tested in a broad range of concentrations. The non-nitrosylated form of SNAP, N-acetylpenicillamine (NAP), was included as a control compound in the assay. Antiviral activity was estimated by the inhibition of the SARS-CoV cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells, determined by a tetrazolium-based colorimetric method. Cytotoxicity of the compounds was tested in parallel. Conclusion: The survival rate of SARS-CoV infected cells was greatly increased by the treatment with SNAP, and the concentration of this compound needed to inhibit the viral cytopathic effect to 50% was 222\u03BCM, with a selectivity index of 3. No anti-SARS-CoV effect could be detected for SNP and NAP.","publish_time":"2004-07-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Keyaerts, Els; Vijgen, Leen; Chen, Luni; Maes, Piet; Hedenstierna, G\u00F6ran; Van Ranst, Marc","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/443520014fd6d089fdb345625aeefe1b535f1c83.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7128975.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971204000529; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971204000529","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV cytopathic effect","SARS coronavirus","anti-SARS-CoV effect","CoV infected cells","survival rate of SARS","Vero E6 cells","N-acetylpenicillamine","viral cytopathic effect","Antiviral activity","SNP","effective antiviral agents","non-nitrosylated form of SNAP","donor compounds","antiviral potential of nitric oxide","control compound","replicating","recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome","African Green Monkey","S-nitroso","strain Frankfurt","search","inhibition","assessment","tetrazolium","sodium nitroprusside","Abstract Introduction","Results","\u03BCM","disease","Conclusion","treatment","broad range of concentrations","selectivity index","colorimetric method","assay","study","Cytotoxicity"],"language":"en"},

Although very successful, the method has not received the same level of attention than other alternatives to study Quantitative Structure Active Relationships (QSAR) mainly because lack of ways to measure the uncertainty of the predictions and the need for large datasets. Active learning, a semi-supervised learning approach that makes use of uncertainty to enhance models\u2019 performance while reducing the size of the training sets, has been used in this work to address both problems. We propose two estimators of uncertainty: the pool of regressors and the distance to the training set. The performance of the methods has been evaluated by testing the resulting active learning workflows in 3 diverse datasets: HIV-1 protease inhibitors, Taxol-derivatives and BRD4 inhibitors. The proposed strategies were successful in 80% of the cases for the taxol-derivatives and BRD4 inhibitors, while outperformed random selection in the case of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors time-split.

METHODS: Here, we developed a library construction method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Extension Assembly and Self-Ligation (named \u201CEASeL\u201D) to construct a large V(NAR) antibody library with a size of 1.2 \u00D7 10(10) from six na\u00EFve adult nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum). RESULTS: The next-generation sequencing analysis of 1.19 million full-length V(NAR)s revealed that this library is highly diversified because it covers all four classical V(NAR) types (Types I\u2013IV) including 11% of classical Type I and 57% of classical Type II. About 30% of the total V(NAR)s could not be categorized as any of the classical types. The high variability of complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 length and cysteine numbers are important for the diversity of V(NAR)s. To validate the use of the shark V(NAR) library for antibody discovery, we isolated a panel of V(NAR) phage binders to cancer therapy-related antigens, including glypican-3, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and programmed cell death-1 (PD1). Additionally, we identified binders to viral antigens that included the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike proteins. The isolated shark single-domain antibodies including Type I and Type II V(NAR)s were produced in Escherichia coli and validated for their antigen binding. A Type II V(NAR) (PE38-B6) has a high affinity (K(d) = 10.1 nM) for its antigen. CONCLUSIONS: The na\u00EFve nurse shark V(NAR) library is a useful source for isolating single-domain antibodies to a wide range of antigens. The EASeL method may be applicable to the construction of other large diversity gene expression libraries.","publish_time":"2018-11-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Feng, Mingqian; Bian, Hejiao; Wu, Xiaolin; Fu, Tianyun; Fu, Ying; Hong, Jessica; Fleming, Bryan D; Flajnik, Martin F; Ho, Mitchell","journal":"Antib Ther","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5b25c21a882848393a88f2036871db32f76c7a80.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6312525.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30627698/; https://doi.org/10.1093/abt/tby011","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["NAR","Type II V"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["NAR","classical V","large V","diversity of V","full-length V","panel of V","total V","na\u00EFve nurse shark V","antibody library","classical types","isolated shark single-domain antibodies","library construction method","isolating single-domain antibodies","conventional antibodies","Shark new antigen receptor variable domain","viral antigens","EASeL method","antigen binding","wide range of antigens","severe acute respiratory syndrome","Middle East respiratory syndrome","cancer therapy-related antigens","phage binders","na\u00EFve adult nurse sharks","antibody discovery","high affinity","large diversity gene expression libraries","high variability of complementarity","human epidermal growth factor receptor","MERS","HER2","polymerase chain reaction","useful source","CDR","PCR","glypican","SARS","Extension Assembly","region","cysteine numbers","Ginglymostoma cirratum","BACKGROUND","Self-Ligation","spike proteins","generation sequencing analysis","programmed cell death","restricted epitopes","Escherichia coli","PE38-B6","CONCLUSIONS","PD1","size","RESULTS","nM","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: CAP patients from 12 teaching hospitals were prospectively and consecutively recruited. Basic and clinical information, throat swabs and paired sera were collected. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected by IgG and IgM antibody tests, fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) and culture. A comparative study of the diagnostic values of three methods, including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was conducted. A fourfold or greater increase of IgG antibody titers of paired sera was set as the diagnostic \u201Cgold standard\u201D. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-five CAP patients (52.8% males, median age 47 years, range 14\u201385) were enrolled. Twenty-seven (21.6%) patients were diagnosed with acute Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections by the \u201Cgold standard\u201D. Specificity values of all three methods were around 90%.

CONCLUSIONS: In the defined group of patients, there was a good agreement between positive rate of MP cultivation of throat swabs and acute M. pneumoniae infection (PLR of 10.9).

The scFv genes were cloned into the expression plasmid for recombinant protein expression. These scFvs were shown to inhibit PEDV infectivity by the plaque reduction neutralization assay. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed that the epitopes recognized by these scFvs were in the S1 region of the spike protein. The potential of scFvs to provide prevention against PEDV infections in piglets was further investigated. Piglets orally administered scFvs showed no to mild clinical symptoms, significantly less viral shedding, no mortality and no intestinal lesions. The field application also revealed that the survival rate of piglets was significantly increased by oral administration of scFvs. Our data support the potential role of scFvs in the prevention and treatment of PEDV infection.","publish_time":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Fanqing; Chen, Yuxue; Ke, Yong; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Bo; Yang, Liang; Zhu, Jianguo","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/dfdeaf42e832860f70d1583ef54f9b319b5dd2a9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6356844.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/v11010058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30646521/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PEDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["potential of scFvs","PEDV infectivity","PEDV antigen","PEDV infections","administered scFvs","potential role of scFvs","treatment of PEDV infection","oral administration of scFvs","neonatal piglets","scFv genes","survival rate of piglets","study","effective prevention measure","recombinant protein expression","porcine scFv phage display library","severe diarrhea","neutralizing antibodies","expression plasmid","Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","spike protein","Immunofluorescence assay","plaque reduction neutralization assay","single chain fragment variable","mild clinical symptoms","viral shedding","death","higher affinity","contagious coronavirus","mortality","S1 region","Passive immunization","IFA","rounds of biopanning","data","field application","intestinal lesions","epitopes"],"language":"en"},

No standard immunosuppressive treatment approach is able to control disease progression in patients with SAVI. We studied the efficacy and safety of targeting type I IFN signaling with the Janus kinase inhibitor, ruxolitinib. METHODS: We used DNA sequencing to identify mutations in TMEM173 in patients with peripheral blood type I IFN signature. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was administered on an off-label basis. RESULTS: We identified three patients with SAVI presenting with skin involvement and progressive severe interstitial lung disease. Indirect echocardiographic signs of pulmonary hypertension were present in one case. Following treatment with ruxolitinib, we observed improvements of respiratory function including increased forced vital capacity in two patients, with discontinuation of oxygen therapy and resolution of echocardiographic abnormalities in one case. Efficacy was persistent in one patient and only transitory in the other two patients. Clinical control of skin complications was obtained, and one patient discontinued steroid treatment. One patient, who presented with kidney involvement, showed resolution of hematuria. One patient experienced increased recurrence of severe viral respiratory infections. Monitoring of peripheral blood type I interferon signature during ruxolitinib treatment did not show a stable decrease. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that targeting type I IFN receptor signaling may represent a promising therapeutic option for a subset of patients with SAVI syndrome and severe lung involvement. However, the occurrence of viral respiratory infection might represent an important cautionary note for the application of such form of treatment.

However, in disease endemic settings across many parts of the globe, most of the disease control interventions accounts for small and large ruminants, whereas unusual hosts and/or natural reservoirs, such as camels, remain neglected for disease control measures including routine vaccination. Such a policy drawback not only plays an important role in disease epizootiology particularly in settings where disease is endemic, but also serves an obstacle in disease control and subsequent eradication in future. With this background, using pre-validated ELISA and molecular assays [multiplex PCR, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and real-time (rt)-PCR], we conducted a large-scale pathogen- and antibody-based surveillance for brucellosis, peste des petits ruminants and bluetongue in camel population (n = 992) originating from a wide geographical region in southern part of the Punjab province, Pakistan. Varying in each of the selected districts, the seroprevalence was found to be maximum for bluetongue [n = 697 (70.26%, 95% CI: 67.29\u201373.07)], followed by PPR [n = 193 (19.46%, 95% CI: 17.07\u201322.09)] and brucellosis [n = 66 (6.65%, 95% CI: 5.22\u20138.43)]. Odds of seroprevalence were more significantly associated with pregnancy status (non-pregnant, OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.86\u20135.63, p\u003C0.01), farming system (mixed-animal, OR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.56\u20134.29, p\u003C0.01), breed (Desi, OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.28\u20134.03, p\u003C0.01) and farmer education (illiterate, OR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.45\u20136.93, p\u003C0.01) for BTV, body condition (normal, OR = 3.54, 95% CI: 1.92\u20136.54, p\u003C0.01) and breed (Desi, OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.09\u20134.40, p\u003C0.01) for brucellosis, and feeding system for PPR (grazing, OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.79\u20134.22, p\u003C0.01). Among the total herds included (n = 74), genome corresponding to BT virus (BTV) and brucellosis was detected in 14 (18.92%, 95 CI: 11.09\u201330.04) and 19 herds (25.68%, 95% CI: 16.54\u201337.38), respectively. None of the herds was detected with genome of PPR virus (PPRV). Among the positive herds, serotype 1, 8 and 11 were detected for BTV while all the herds were exclusively positive to B. abortus. Taken together, the study highlights the role of potential disease reservoirs in the persistence and transmission of selected diseases in their susceptible hosts and, therefore, urges necessary interventions (e.g., inclusion of camels for vaccine etc.) for the control of diseases from their endemic setting worldwide.","publish_time":"2020-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shabbir, Muhammad Zubair; Sohail, Tayyebah; Ul-Rahman, Aziz; Abbas, Tariq; Ali, Qasim; Rehman, Zia Ur; Khan, Iahtasham; Yaqub, Tahir; Muhammad, Javed; Ahmad Khan, Sohail; Imran, Muhammad Saeed; Basit, Muhammad Abdul; Ullah, Saleem; Habib, Momena; Gardezi, Syeda Anam Masood; Bashir, Attia; Ahmad, Mushtaq; Abubakar, Muhammad; Abbas, Muhammad; Subhani, Atta; Yasein, Ghulam; Altaaf, Fariha; Aziz, Muhammad Hasaan; Hussain, Riaz; Zohaib, Ali; Chaudhry, Umer; Wensman, Jonas Johansson","journal":"Acta Tropica","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3061c123c016b50f06a3173b26aa145fb471bc4e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7092811.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32142734/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001706X19318303; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001706X19318303","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs4NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BT"],"locations":["Punjab"],"keyphrases":["brucellosis","disease control measures","disease epizootiology","disease endemic settings","disease control interventions accounts","positive herds","control of diseases","role of potential disease reservoirs","bluetongue","BTV","total herds","genome of PPR virus","petits ruminants","large ruminants","multiplex PCR","peste","important role","BT virus","breed","Desi","transmission of selected diseases","unusual hosts","camel population","susceptible hosts","natural reservoirs","inclusion of camels","necessary interventions","farming system","selected districts","Odds of seroprevalence","molecular assays","reverse transcriptase","pre-validated ELISA","persistence","antibody-based surveillance","public health pathogens","subsequent eradication","obstacle","routine vaccination","large-scale pathogen","extended range of host susceptibility","future","parts","globe","Punjab province","pregnancy status","mixed-animal","wide geographical region","background","body condition","farmer education","illiterate","vaccine","study","PPRV","grazing","policy drawback","Pakistan","serotype","abortus"],"language":"en"},

To control transmission, public health officials confirm the measles diagnosis, identify close contacts of infectious cases, deliver public health interventions (i.e., post-exposure prophylaxis) among those who are eligible, and follow-up with the close contacts to determine overall health outcomes. A stochastic network simulation of measles contact tracing was conducted using existing agent-based modeling software and a synthetic population with high levels of immunity in order to estimate the impact of different interventions in controlling measles transmission. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The synthetic population was created to simulate California\u0060s population in terms of population demographics, household, workplace, school, and neighborhood characteristics using California Department of Finance 2010 census data. Parameters for the model were obtained from a review of the literature, California measles case surveillance data, and expert opinion. Eight different scenarios defined by the use of three different public health interventions were evaluated: (a) post-exposure measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, (b) post-exposure immune globulin (IG), and (c) voluntary isolation and home quarantine in the presence or absence of public health response delays. Voluntary isolation and home quarantine coupled with one or two other interventions had the greatest reduction in the number of secondary cases infected by the index case and the probability of escape situations (i.e., the outbreak continues after 90 days). CONCLUSIONS: Interrupting contact patterns via voluntary isolation and home quarantine are particularly important in reducing the number of secondary cases infected by the index case and the probability of uncontrolled outbreaks.","publish_time":"2016-12-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Enanoria, Wayne T.

We propose a list of approximately 100 systems-based candidate genes for future study of the genetic basis of influenza disease and immunity in humans, based on evidence in the published literature for their potential role in the pathogenesis of this infection: binding of the virus to receptors on the host cell surface; cleavability of HA by host proteases; virus replication in host cells; destruction of host cells by apoptosis; state of immunocompetence of the individual host; and viral infections predisposing to bacterial infection.","publish_time":"2009-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Lyna; Katz, Jacqueline M.; Gwinn, Marta; Dowling, Nicole F.; Khoury, Muin J.","journal":"Infection, Genetics and Evolution","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39ec1b0181743887c59201563f7900331c0f0e4a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106103.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19647099/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134809001798; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2009.07.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134809001798","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza infection","host proteases","individual host","host factors","Abstract Influenza","destruction of host cells","host cell surface","genetic basis of influenza disease","bacterial infection","outcome of infection","virulent strains of influenza viruses","ongoing threat of seasonal influenza","virus replication","potential role","viral infections","potential emergence of new","complex interplay of viral","better understanding of genetic variation","systems-based candidate genes","future study","cleavability of HA","human population","immunity","association","severe outcomes","state of immunocompetence","apoptosis","receptors","evidence","published literature","humans","pathogenesis","binding","serious respiratory illness","hospitalization","death"],"language":"en"},

Typically, protein grafting involves the transplantation of protein side chains from a functional motif onto structurally homologous regions of scaffold proteins. Using this approach, we previously transplanted the human immunodeficiency virus 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes onto heterologous proteins to design novel \u201Cepitope-scaffold\u201D antigens. However, side-chain grafting is limited by the availability of scaffolds with compatible backbone for a given epitope structure and offers no route to modify backbone structure to improve mimicry or binding affinity. To address this, we report here a new and more aggressive computational method\u2014backbone grafting of linear motifs\u2014that transplants the backbone and side chains of linear functional motifs onto scaffold proteins. To test this method, we first used side-chain grafting to design new 2F5 epitope scaffolds with improved biophysical characteristics. We then independently transplanted the 2F5 epitope onto three of the same parent scaffolds using the newly developed backbone grafting procedure. Crystal structures of side-chain and backbone grafting designs showed close agreement with both the computational models and the desired epitope structure. In two cases, backbone grafting scaffolds bound antibody 2F5 with 30- and 9-fold higher affinity than corresponding side-chain grafting designs. These results demonstrate that flexible backbone methods for epitope grafting can significantly improve binding affinities over those achieved by fixed backbone methods alone. Backbone grafting of linear motifs is a general method to transplant functional motifs when backbone remodeling of the target scaffold is necessary.","publish_time":"2012-01-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Azoitei, Mihai L.; Ban, Yih-En Andrew; Julien, Jean-Philippe; Bryson, Steve; Schroeter, Alexandria; Kalyuzhniy, Oleksandr; Porter, Justin R.; Adachi, Yumiko; Baker, David; Pai, Emil F.; Schief, William R.","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/882abd9ead35b19fb10f87136bd8142458d8e3b8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7105911.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2011.10.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283611011272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22061265/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283611011272","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs0OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["epitope grafting","chain grafting","backbone structure","protein grafting","compatible backbone","backbone remodeling","developed backbone","epitope-scaffold","Abstract Computational grafting of functional motifs","flexible backbone methods","fixed backbone methods","linear motifs","new 2F5 epitope scaffolds","novel proteins","chains of linear functional motifs","given epitope structure","desired epitope structure","heterologous proteins","homologous regions of scaffold proteins","target scaffold","antibody 2F5","availability of scaffolds","parent scaffolds","aggressive computational method","computational models","general method","binding affinity","designs","human immunodeficiency virus 2F5","transplantation of protein","binding affinities","higher affinity","4E10 epitopes","promising way","improved biophysical characteristics","close agreement","route","pre-specified functionalities","mimicry","results","cases","antigens","Crystal structures","procedure","approach"],"language":"en"},

In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it. It is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input. Applied to the Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus, our prediction demonstrated that several vertebrate-infectious coronaviruses have strong potential to infect human. This method will be helpful in future viral analysis and early prevention and control of viral pathogens.","publish_time":"2020-01-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Guo, Qian; Li, Mo; Wang, Chunhui; Wang, Peihong; Fang, Zhencheng; tan, Jie; Wu, Shufang; Xiao, Yonghong; Zhu, Huaiqiu","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d2a557f18ca3ad25962a7fce457eff2802f2adaa.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a05179c57d5e1cdddc839ff3c0b70a614efbb6cb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.21.914044","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Guo"],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","Middle East"],"keyphrases":["bat coronaviruses","human coronaviruses","virus host prediction method","Novel Coronavirus","novel viruses","mink viruses","close infectivity","closer infectivity pattern","similar infectivity patterns","Bat SARS","consequences of infectivity pattern analysis","discovered virus","vertebrate-infectious coronaviruses","potential hosts of viruses","risk of infecting human","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","SARS-CoV","kind of host","Wuhan","vertebrates","future viral analysis","deep learning algorithm","risks of infecting people","strong potential","MERS-CoV","control of viral pathogens","early prevention","China","VHP","recent outbreak of pneumonia","DNA sequence","candidate reservoirs","nCoVs","importance","Guo","input","great value","properties","report","results"],"language":"en"},

The vaccines and bio-therapeutic protein production in plants hold the promise of significantly lowering the cost of manufacturing life-saving drugs. This review will reflect the current status and challenges that the molecular farming platform faces becoming a strategic solution for the development of low-cost bio-therapeutics for developing countries. RECENT FINDINGS: Different plant parts have been successfully identified as suitable expression systems for the commercial production of therapeutic proteins for some human and animal diseases ranging from common cold to AIDS. The processed therapeutics from such sources are devoid of any toxic components. The large-scale cultivation of these transgenic plants would be possible anywhere in the world including developing countries, which lack sophisticated drug manufacturing units. A couple of such commercially generated products have already hit the market with success. Newer methods using suitable plant viruses and recombinant gene expression systems have already been devised for producing therapeutic proteins and peptides. SUMMARY: Plants are promising bio-factories for therapeutic protein production because of their several advantages over the other expression systems especially the advanced mechanisms for protein synthesis and post-translational modification which are very much similar to animal cells. Plant biotechnologists are much attracted to the bio-farming because of its flexibility, scalability, low manufacturing cost, as well as the lack of risk of toxic or pathogenic contamination. A number of projects on bio-farming are designed and are at various developmental stages but have not yet become available to the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we need further advancement in the optimization of lab protocols for up-scaling the production of such therapeutics at commercial level with a promise to offer their best clinical use.","publish_time":"2017-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, Ankit; Kaur, Gurminder; Singh, Sanchita; Singh, Neetu; Saxena, Gauri; Verma, Praveen C.","journal":"Curr Mol Biol Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a18c85c2b16eab20779da0d0d870f94e5b94b23c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7099902.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40610-017-0078-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226727/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs1OTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bio-therapeutic protein production","commercial production of therapeutic proteins","bio-farming","production of recombinant proteins","large quantities of therapeutic proteins","suitable expression systems","development of low-cost bio-therapeutics","plant bioreactors","Plant biotechnologists","suitable plant viruses","promising bio-factories","recombinant gene expression systems","protein synthesis","promise","Different plant parts","transgenic plants","low manufacturing cost","cost of manufacturing life","processed therapeutics","developing countries","molecular farming platform","animal diseases","commercial level","sophisticated drug manufacturing units","toxic components","animal cells","PURPOSE OF REVIEW","lack of risk","advanced mechanisms","strategic solution","requirement","flexibility","post-translational modification","challenges","sources","scalability","advantages","current status","Newer methods","RECENT FINDINGS","vaccines","pathogenic contamination","optimization of lab protocols","market","generated products","advancement","AIDS","best clinical use","large-scale cultivation","world","drugs","number of projects","SUMMARY","various developmental stages","pharmaceutical industry","couple","peptides","success"],"language":"en"},

After anamnesis the cat was submitted to a complete clinical examination. Blood was collected for determination of haematological and biochemical parameters, detection of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and Leishmania amastigotes. Fine-needle aspiration puncture from the skin nodules was also performed. After definitive diagnosis the animal was treated and followed up over a 2 year period. The animal tested negative for FIV-specific antibodies, FeLV antigen and feline coronavirus RNA. Leishmania amastigotes in the skin nodules were confirmed by cytology and molecular diagnosis. Treatment was initiated with allopurinol, resulting in a slight clinical improvement. Thus, N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate was added and administered for 30 days, with complete closure of the ulcerative lesions in the hindlimbs requiring a surgical approach. Close monitoring of the patient in the following 24 months indicated that combined therapy was safe and clinical cure was achieved without further relapses or side effects. RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: Considering the increasing number of feline leishmaniosis cases and the inconsistent results of most therapeutic protocols described in the literature, the use of new approaches, especially in refractory cases, is essential. Although the use of allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate is off-label in cats, in this case the combination treatment was followed by an extensive analytical monitoring, supporting their safety and effectiveness.","publish_time":"2016-02-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Basso, Maria Alexandra; Marques, C\u00E1tia; Santos, Marcos; Duarte, Ana; Pissarra, Hugo; Carreira, L Miguel; Gomes, L\u00EDdia; Val\u00E9rio-Bolas, Ana; Tavares, Lu\u00EDs; Santos-Gomes, Gabriela; Pereira da Fonseca, Isabel","journal":"JFMS Open Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/357af8bb837fb3521423284fa624316d0965bfa3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5362848.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2055116916630002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28491411/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["feline immunodeficiency virus","feline coronavirus RNA","skin nodules","clinical cure","Leishmania amastigotes","complete clinical examination","slight clinical improvement","detection of feline leukaemia virus","increasing number of feline leishmaniosis cases","Leishmania species","ulcerative lesions","nodular skin lesions","glucamine antimoniate","N-methyl","combination treatment","successful treatment","use of allopurinol","molecular diagnosis","definitive diagnosis","FeLV antigen","refractory cases","complete closure","Close monitoring","CASE SUMMARY","year period","FIV-specific antibodies","year-old domestic cat","extensive analytical monitoring","animal tested negative","use of new approaches","biochemical parameters","combined therapy","inconsistent results","presenting fever","months","literature","work","pyodermatitis","FCoV","determination of haematological","Fine-needle aspiration puncture","NOVEL INFORMATION","therapeutic protocols","patient","safety","hindlimbs","cats","label","cytology","relapses","surgical approach","RELEVANCE","Blood","effectiveness","days","effects","anamnesis"],"language":"en"},

Participants and procedure The sample consisted of 333 nurses (315 women, 18 men) who completed an Internet-mediated questionnaire that was posted on the Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario (RNAO) website between March and May 2004. The questionnaire was restricted to respondents who had to authenticate their RNAO membership with a valid username and password before accessing the questionnaire. This served a dual purpose: to ensure that only RNAO nurses completed the questionnaire and thereby safeguarding the generalizability of the findings; and second, to prevent any one nurse from contributing more than once to the overall sample. Results Correlational analysis yielded several significant relationships between psychosocial variables and working conditions, and the traditional correlates of burnout and stress. Three multiple regression analysis revealed that the model we evolved\u2014including higher levels of vigor, organizational support, and trust in equipment/infection control initiative; and lower levels of contact with SARS patients, and time spent in quarantine\u2014predicted to lower levels of avoidance behavior, emotional exhaustion, and state anger. Conclusions By employing models of stress and burnout that combine psychosocial variables and working conditions, researchers can account for significant amounts of variance in outcomes related to burnout. These findings highlight the importance of vigor and perceived organizational support in predicting nurses\u2019 symptoms of burnout. For healthcare administrators, this means that a likely strategy for assuaging the negative outcomes of stress should address nurses\u2019 psychosocial concerns and the working conditions that they face during novel times of crisis.","publish_time":"2007-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marjanovic, Zdravko; Greenglass, Esther R.; Coffey, Sue","journal":"International Journal of Nursing Studies","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c616a84b4f9479c22a6094bd19a26fd85134b59.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094220.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748906000745; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020748906000745","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RNAO"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["working conditions","psychosocial variables","nurses\u2019 psychosocial concerns","predicting nurses\u2019 symptoms of burnout","RNAO nurses","lower levels of contact","higher levels of vigor","nurses\u2019 coping methods","negative outcomes of stress","RNAO membership","models of stress","traditional correlates of burnout","Internet-mediated questionnaire","findings","lower levels of avoidance behavior","Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario","perceived organizational support","SARS patients","importance of vigor","significant relationships","Correlational analysis","dual purpose","overall sample","significant amounts of variance","novel times of crisis","multiple regression analysis","response","trust","severe acute respiratory syndrome","emotional exhaustion","infection control initiative","distress","equipment","researchers","valid username","investigation","password","quarantine","state anger","likely strategy","Abstract Objectives","website","procedure","Canada","Participants","women","Conclusions","generalizability","respondents","healthcare administrators"],"language":"en"},

However, there are no reports of changes in the microbial diversity of fecal microbiome after treatment with FMT in canine IBD cases. Moreover, little is known about the long-term efficacy and safety of FMT treatment for dogs. Herein, we present a case of canine intractable IBD treated with repeated, long-term FMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patient was a 10-year-old, neutered, male, 4-kg Toy Poodle with a prolonged history of vomiting and diarrhea. Fecal examination for pathogens was negative. Despite treatment with multiple antibacterial and antidiarrheal agents, the patient showed no improvement. Endoscopic mucus sampling diagnosed a case of lymphocytic-plasmacytic duodenitis, ie, idiopathic IBD. Eventually, we performed periodic, long-term fecal microbiota transplantation of fresh donor feces collected from a 4-year-old, 32.8-kg, neutered male Golden Retriever by rectal enema. Additionally, we performed 16S rRNA sequence analysis, before and after FMT, to evaluate the microbiome diversity. RESULTS: Fecal microbiome diversity after FMT resembled that of the healthy donor dog\u2019s fecal microbiome, before FMT, which led us to conclude that the fecal microbiome in our patient normalized with FMT. Moreover, the clinical symptoms improved remarkably with regard to the changes in the fecal microbiome. Additionally, we noted no observable side effects during FMT treatment. CONCLUSION: This report indicates the efficacy and safety of long-term, periodic FMT for a case of canine IBD based on attenuation of clinical symptoms and changes in fecal microbiome diversity. Therefore, FMT could be chosen as a treatment option for IBD in canines in the future.","publish_time":"2019-12-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Niina, Ayaka; Kibe, Ryoko; Suzuki, Ryohei; Yuchi, Yunosuke; Teshima, Takahiro; Matsumoto, Hirotaka; Kataoka, Yasushi; Koyama, Hidekazu","journal":"Vet Med (Auckl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1d8d4fed8118f54a4a5db8892cc5e5bbbf19afa4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6898721.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.2147/vmrr.s230862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31819862/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["long-term FMT","Fecal microbiome diversity","periodic FMT","safety of FMT treatment","microbial diversity of fecal microbiome","Fecal examination","treatment option","case of canine IBD","healthy donor dog\u2019s fecal microbiome","idiopathic IBD","canine IBD cases","case of canine intractable IBD","long-term fecal microbiota transplantation of fresh donor feces","safety of long-term","long-term efficacy","case of lymphocytic","reports of changes","year-old","attenuation of clinical symptoms","neutered male Golden Retriever","diseases","GI","antidiarrheal agents","rectal enema","plasmacytic duodenitis","prolonged history of vomiting","Toy Poodle","inflammatory bowel disease","veterinary medicine","canines","regard","Endoscopic mucus sampling","RESULTS","S rRNA sequence analysis","pathogens","PURPOSE","effects","dogs","CONCLUSION","PATIENTS","METHODS","improvement","future"],"language":"en"},

Therefore, a single assay that can accurately identify all orthopoxviruses could provide a valuable tool for rapid broad orthopovirus identification. We have developed a pan-Orthopoxvirus assay for identification of all members of the genus based on four PCR reactions targeting Orthopoxvirus DNA and RNA helicase and polymerase genes. The amplicons are detected using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) on the Ibis T5000 system. We demonstrate that the assay can detect and identify a diverse collection of orthopoxviruses, provide sub-species information and characterize viruses from the blood of rabbitpox infected rabbits. The assay is sensitive at the stochastic limit of PCR and detected virus in blood containing approximately six plaque-forming units per milliliter from a rabbitpox virus-infected rabbit.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Eshoo, Mark W.; Whitehouse, Chris A.; Nalca, Aysegul; Zoll, Scott; Ecker, Joseph A.; Hall, Thomas A.; Pennella, Thuy-Trang D.; Duncan, David D.; Desai, Anjali; Moradi, Emily K.; Rudnick, Karl; Libby, Brian; Ranken, Raymond; Sampath, Rangarajan; Hofstadler, Steven A.; Ecker, David J.; Blyn, Lawrence B.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/82f3e5abcabd0756aae8c054832a80658915bde3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2710004.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19623263/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0006342","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs2NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["genus Orthopoxvirus","pan-Orthopoxvirus assay","detected virus","single assay","PCR reactions","Orthopoxvirus DNA","Variola virus","rabbitpox virus-infected rabbit","members","blood of rabbitpox infected rabbits","stochastic limit of PCR","species of related viruses","sub-species information","causative agent of smallpox","diverse collection of orthopoxviruses","rapid broad orthopovirus identification","RNA helicase","valuable tool","ESI-MS","electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry","cowpox","human infection","milliliter","polymerase genes","monkeypox","units","plaque","zoonotic rodent","Ibis T5000 system","amplicons","addition"],"language":"en"},

However, the elicitation of b12 or b12-like antibodies in vivo by vaccine immunogens based on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) has not been successful. B12 is highly divergent from the closest corresponding germline antibody while X5 is less divergent. We have hypothesized that the relatively high degree of specific somatic hypermutations may preclude binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) to closest germline antibodies, and that identifying antibodies that are intermediates in the pathways to maturation could help design novel vaccine immunogens to guide the immune system for their enhanced elicitation. In support of this hypothesis we have previously found that a germline-like b12 (monovalent and bivalent scFv as an Fc fusion protein or IgG) lacks measurable binding to an Env as measured by ELISA with a sensitivity in the \u03BCM range [1]; here we present evidence confirming and expanding these findings for a panel of Envs. In contrast, a germline-like scFv X5 bound Env with high (nM) affinity. To begin to explore the maturation pathways of these antibodies we identified several possible b12 intermediate antibodies and tested their neutralizing activity. These intermediate antibodies neutralized only some HIV-1 isolates and with relatively weak potency. In contrast, germline-like scFv X5 neutralized a subset of the tested HIV-1 isolates with comparable efficiencies to that of the mature X5. These results could help explain the relatively high immunogenicity of the coreceptor binding site on gp120 and the abundance of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients (X5 is a CD4i antibody) as well as the maturation pathway of X5. They also can help identify antigens that can bind specifically to b12 germline and intermediate antibodies that together with Envs could be used as a conceptually novel type of candidate vaccines. Such candidate vaccines based on two or more immunogens could help guiding the immune system through complex maturation pathways for elicitation of antibodies that are similar or identical to antibodies with known properties.","publish_time":"2009-11-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiao, Xiaodong; Chen, Weizao; Feng, Yang; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.","journal":"Viruses","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/789d8f8e801484da5740462f088a39aaf4e2a411.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3185542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994570/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v1030802","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3MDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elicitation of antibodies","b12 germline","closest germline antibodies","possible b12 intermediate antibodies","elicitation of b12","human monoclonal antibodies","Fab X5","mature X5","function b12","maturation pathway of X5","tested HIV","scFv X5 bound Env","broad HIV","closest corresponding germline antibody","complex maturation pathways","CD4i antibody","bivalent scFv","immune system","measurable binding","high immunogenicity","antibody fragments","design novel vaccine immunogens","envelope glycoprotein","isolates","enhanced elicitation","neutralizing activity","contrast","novel type of candidate vaccines","coreceptor binding site","panel of Envs","high degree of specific somatic hypermutations","exhibit","Fc fusion protein","gp120","IgG","terms of structure","hmAbs","comparable efficiencies","nM","infected patients","abundance of CD4","findings","best","subset","known properties","sensitivity","ELISA","affinity","\u03BCM range","present evidence","weak potency","support","hypothesis","results","antigens"],"language":"en"},

Environmental studies have shown that animal coronaviruses remain infectious in water and sewage for up to a year depending on the temperature and humidity. In this study, we examined coronavirus stability on lettuce surfaces. A cell culture adapted bovine coronavirus, diluted in growth media or in bovine fecal suspensions to simulate fecal contamination was used to spike romaine lettuce. qRT-PCR detected viral RNA copy number ranging from 6.6 \u00D7 10(4) to 1.7 \u00D7 10(6) throughout the experimental period of 30 days. Whereas infectious viruses were detected for at least 14 days, the amount of infectious virus varied, depending upon the diluent used for spiking the lettuce. UV and confocal microscopic observation indicated attachment of residual labeled virions to the lettuce surface after the elution procedure, suggesting that rates of inactivation or detection of the virus may be underestimated. Thus, it is possible that contaminated vegetables may be potential vehicles for coronavirus zoonotic transmission to humans.","publish_time":"2012-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mullis, Lisa; Saif, Linda J.; Zhang, Yongbin; Zhang, Xuming; Azevedo, Marli S.P.","journal":"Food Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/61b5630e5836d5059e5f360f470e45698a587024.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a78663bdb83f4bdb19a1a4f304cb18e31a9e846a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4980993.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002011002814; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0740002011002814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22265299/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2011.12.009","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","SARS","RNA"],"locations":["Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["SARS coronavirus","bovine coronavirus","coronavirus zoonotic transmission","coronavirus stability","romaine lettuce","lettuce surfaces","bovine fecal suspensions","fecal contamination","sewage","modes of transmission","water","days","infectious viruses","aerosol route of transmission","attachment of residual labeled virions","potential vehicles","cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome","confocal microscopic observation","cases","growth media","animal coronaviruses","feces","viral RNA copy number","qRT-PCR","contaminated vegetables","elution procedure","World Health Organization","research","UV","rates of inactivation","humans","food","event","Environmental studies","year","detection","cell culture","Hong Kong","temperature","humidity","experimental period","study","diluent"],"language":"en"},

However, little is known about bufavirus or its close relatives in nonhuman mammals. In this study, we performed nested-PCR screening and identified bufavirus from 12 megabats of Pteropus spp. in Indonesia. Furthermore, we determined nearly the full genome sequence of a novel megabat-borne bufavirus, tentatively named megabat bufavirus 1. Phylogenetic analyses showed that megabat bufavirus 1 clustered with known protoparvoviruses, including human bufavirus but represented a distinct lineage of bufavirus. Our analyses also inferred phylogenetic relationships among animal-borne bufaviruses recently reported by other studies. Recombination analyses suggested that the most common recent ancestor of megabat bufavirus 1 might have arisen from multiple genetic recombination events. These results characterized megabat bufavirus 1 as the first protoparvovirus discovered from megabats and indicates the high genetic divergence of bufavirus.","publish_time":"2016-04-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sasaki, Michihito; Gonzalez, Gabriel; Wada, Yuji; Setiyono, Agus; Handharyani, Ekowati; Rahmadani, Ibenu; Taha, Siswatiana; Adiani, Sri; Latief, Munira; Kholilullah, Zainal Abidin; Subangkit, Mawar; Kobayashi, Shintaro; Nakamura, Ichiro; Kimura, Takashi; Orba, Yasuko; Ito, Kimihito; Sawa, Hirofumi","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7e4299dd78b35e5223c34355cd13c9c99ed72c25.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4845017.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27113297/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep24257","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3NTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bufavirus"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Indonesia"],"keyphrases":["human bufavirus","distinct lineage of bufavirus","common recent ancestor of megabat bufavirus","high genetic divergence of bufavirus","novel megabat","Phylogenetic analyses","Recombination analyses","genus Protoparvovirus","known protoparvoviruses","megabats of Pteropus","phylogenetic relationships","multiple genetic recombination events","bufaviruses","animal","close relatives","nested-PCR screening","patients","recognized member","nonhuman mammals","subfamily Parvovirinae","genome sequence","diarrhoea","countries","study","Indonesia","results","studies"],"language":"en"},

The complete or nearly complete genome sequence of five canine astroviruses was reconstructed that allowed mapping the genome organization and to investigate the genetic diversity of these viruses. The genome was about 6.6kb in length and contained three open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by a 5\u2032 UTR, and a 3\u2032 UTR plus a poly-A tail. ORF1a and ORF1b overlapped by 43 nucleotides while the ORF2 overlapped by 8 nucleotides with the 3\u2032 end of ORF1b. Upon genome comparison, four strains (HUN/2012/2, HUN/2012/6, HUN/2012/115, and HUN/2012/135) were more related genetically to each other and to UK canine astroviruses (88\u201396% nt identity), whilst strain HUN/2012/126 was more divergent (75\u201376% nt identity). In the ORF1b and ORF2, strains HUN/2012/2, HUN/2012/6, and HUN/2012/135 were related genetically to other canine astroviruses identified formerly in Europe and China, whereas strain HUN/2012/126 was related genetically to a divergent canine astrovirus strain, ITA/2010/Zoid. For one canine astrovirus, HUN/2012/8, only a 3.2kb portion of the genome, at the 3\u2032 end, could be determined. Interestingly, this strain possessed unique genetic signatures (including a longer ORF1b/ORF2 overlap and a longer 3\u2032UTR) and it was divergent in both ORF1b and ORF2 from all other canine astroviruses, with the highest nucleotide sequence identity (68% and 63%, respectively) to a mink astrovirus, thus suggesting a possible event of interspecies transmission.

Therefore, our study suggests that the immunotherapy of CRC with Aex in combination with GM-CSF is feasible and safe, and thus can serve as an alternative choice in the immunotherapy of advanced CRC.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dai, Shengming; Wei, Dong; Wu, Zhen; Zhou, Xiangyang; Wei, Xiaomou; Huang, Haixin; Li, Guisheng","journal":"Molecular Therapy","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d1f6d57c9a112fb1afc5c8a819b293cf8146ee9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7106337.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001616314617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18362931/; https://doi.org/10.1038/mt.2008.1; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525001616314617","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3OTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CRC","CEA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Aex","GM-CSF","immunotherapy of CRC","immunotherapy of advanced CRC","study","tumor cells","ascites-derived exosomes","combination","diverse immunomodulatory markers of exosomes","clinical trial","CEA","immunotherapy of colorectal cancer","cancer treatments","patients","dendritic cells","immunomodulatory functions","nm vesicles","beneficial tumor-specific antitumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte","small membrane vesicles","CTL","Dex","total","sucrose","Tex","macrophage colony","granulocyte","factor","D2O density gradient ultracentrifugation","subcutaneous immunizations","malignant effusions","response","phase","carcinoembryonic antigen","weekly intervals","HLA-A0201","alternative choice","groups","multitude of cell types","therapies"],"language":"en"},

Viruses such as rotavirus, adenovirus, and caliciviruses are a major cause of AGE, but in many patients a causal agent cannot be found despite extensive diagnostic testing. Proposing that novel viruses are the reason for this diagnostic gap, we used molecular screening to investigate a cluster of undiagnosed cases that were part of a larger case control study into the etiology of pediatric AGE. Degenerate oligonucleotide primed (DOP) PCR was used to non-specifically amplify viral DNA from fecal specimens. The amplified DNA was then cloned and sequenced for analysis. A novel virus was detected. Elucidation and analysis of the genome indicates it is a member of the Bocavirus genus of the Parvovirinae, 23% variant at the nucleotide level from its closest formally recognized relative, the Human Bocavirus (HBoV), and similar to the very recently proposed second species of Bocavirus (HBoV2). Fecal samples collected from case control pairs during 2001 for the AGE study were tested with a bocavirus-specific PCR, and HBoV2 (sequence confirmed) was detected in 32 of 186 cases with AGE (prevalence 17.2%) compared with only 15 controls (8.1%). In this same group of children, HBoV2 prevalence was exceeded only by rotavirus (39.2%) and astrovirus (21.5%) and was more prevalent than norovirus genogroup 2 (13.4%) and adenovirus (4.8%). In a univariate analysis of the matched pairs (McNemar\u0027s Test), the odds ratio for the association of AGE with HBoV2 infection was 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2\u20135.7); P = 0.007. During the course of this screening, a second novel bocavirus was detected which we have designated HBoV species 3 (HBoV3). The prevalence of HBoV3 was low (2.7%), and it was not associated with AGE. HBoV2 and HBoV3 are newly discovered bocaviruses, of which HBoV2 is the thirdmost-prevalent virus, after rotavirus and astrovirus, associated with pediatric AGE in this study.","publish_time":"2009-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Arthur, Jane L.; Higgins, Geoffrey D.; Davidson, Geoffrey P.; Givney, Rodney C.; Ratcliff, Rodney M.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/710bf21a0b14c7512f2680ba1413c518432d7278.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2663820.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19381259/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000391","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs3OTU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Bocavirus"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["AGE study","association of AGE","age groups","HBoV2 prevalence","etiology of pediatric AGE","novel bocavirus","major cause of AGE","HBoV2 infection","species of Bocavirus","Human Bocavirus","Bocavirus genus","rotavirus","prevalence of HBoV3","bocavirus-specific PCR","novel viruses","case control pairs","larger case control study","astrovirus","prevalent virus","univariate analysis","adenovirus","designated HBoV species","matched pairs","diagnostic gap","molecular screening","Fecal samples","fecal specimens","viral DNA","amplified DNA","extensive diagnostic testing","cluster of undiagnosed cases","McNemar\u0027s Test","odds ratio","caliciviruses","common illness","reason","discovered bocaviruses","nucleotide level","causal agent","variant","Degenerate oligonucleotide","DOP","genome","Parvovirinae","member","patients","sequence","group of children","Acute gastroenteritis","confidence interval","norovirus genogroup","Elucidation","deaths","course","controls"],"language":"en"},

These questions aside, there is clear evidence for actions of angiotensin peptides in regions behind the blood\u2013brain barrier. Receptors for angiotensin peptides, including AT1 and AT2 receptors, are distributed in a characteristic pattern throughout the brain, with many of these sites behind the blood\u2013brain barrier. Stimulation of these receptors affects multiple physiological functions \u2013 actions which often complement the physiological roles established for the systemic renin\u2013angiotensin system. These include effects on fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, autonomic and neuroendocrine regulation, and modulation of sensory function.

Mefloquine, a human anti-malarial agent, has been shown to inhibit FIPV in vitro. As a first step to evaluate its efficacy and safety profile as a potential FIP treatment for cats, mefloquine underwent incubation in feline, canine and common brush-tailed possum microsomes and phase I metabolism cofactors to determine its rate of phase I depletion. Tramadol was used as a phase I positive control as it undergoes this reaction in both dogs and cats. Using the substrate depletion method, the in vitro intrinsic clearance (mean \u00B1 S.D.) of mefloquine by pooled feline and common brush-tailed possum microsomes was 4.5 \u00B1 0.35 and 18.25 \u00B1 3.18 \u03BCL/min/mg protein, respectively. However, phase I intrinsic clearance was too slow to determine with canine microsomes. Liquid chromatography\u2014mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified carboxymefloquine in samples generated by feline microsomes as well as negative controls, suggesting some mefloquine instability. Mefloquine also underwent incubation with feline, canine and common brush-tailed possum microsomes and phase II glucuronidative metabolism cofactors. O-desmethyltramadol (ODMT or M1) was used as a positive control as it undergoes a phase II glucuronidation reaction in these species. The rates of phase II mefloquine depletion by microsomes by all three species were too slow to estimate. Therefore mefloquine likely undergoes phase I hepatic metabolism catalysed by feline and common brush-tailed possum microsomes but not phase II glucuronidative metabolism in all three species and mefloquine is not likely to have delayed elimination in cats with clinically normal, hepatic function.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Izes, Aaron Michael; Kimble, Benjamin; Norris, Jacqueline Marie; Govendir, Merran","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9b0b56ad54408dfaed3ee581d6a746be93e1c1af.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156057.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287278/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230975","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["feline microsomes","mefloquine depletion","canine microsomes","rate of phase","rates of phase","common brush-tailed possum microsomes","mefloquine instability","pooled feline","feline infectious peritonitis virus","hepatic metabolism","species","glucuronidative metabolism cofactors","incubation","intrinsic clearance","positive control","FIPV","immune-mediated disease of cats","substrate depletion method","hepatic function","glucuronidation reaction","potential FIP treatment","LC-MS","safety profile","mass spectrometry","carboxymefloquine","negative controls","delayed elimination","Liquid chromatography","efficacy","M1","human anti-malarial agent","samples","O-desmethyltramadol","ODMT","mean","step","dogs","\u03BCL","protein"],"language":"en"},

The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of geographical extension than in altitude. In the next years the engagement of the health sector would be working to develop prevention and adaptation programs in order to reduce the costs and burden of climate change.","publish_time":"2016-12-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rossati, Antonella","journal":"Int J Occup Environ Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94af6bf9cae266730bbc0480ab71595c12072891.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6679631.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.15171/ijoem.2017.963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28051192/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Earth"],"keyphrases":["burden of climate change","Climate change scenarios","increased mortality","increased pollution","increased average temperature","viral diseases","Tick-borne diseases","warmer climate","transmission of water","human health","distribution of infectious diseases","increased cases of leptospirosis","non-communicable diseases","transmission of human","water heating","life cycle","fresh-water resources","reduced availability of water","effects of rising temperature","agricultural land","agricultural resources","human activities","natural disasters","cycle of development","rising temperatures","health sector","mental health","impact","animal pathogens","loss of productivity","degradation of ecosystems","soil degradation","loss of biodiversity","arable land","past years","Global warming","case of mosquitoes","accumulation of toxic substances","food chain","greenhouse gases","outbreaks","changes","cold-blooded host invertebrate","desertification","injuries","famine","malnutrition","alterations","nitrous oxide","carbon dioxide","Earth\u0027s atmosphere","creation of habitats suitable","order","complications","methane","density","century","malaria","campylobacter infections","heat waves","cold regions","oceans","costs","favorable conditions","widespread worldwide illnesses","disruption","prevention","survival","production of eggs","completion","acidification","vectors","weather extreme events","adaptation programs","depletion of stratospheric ozone","low-income countries","terms of geographical extension","altitude","cryptosporidiosis","tick population","Direct exposure","areas of presence","ticks","floods","engagement","time","ill patients","People"],"language":"en"},

CRCoV may play an important role in canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) either by predisposing to further and potentially more serious viral and bacterial infections or possibly as a primary pathogen. The prevalence of serum antibodies to CRCoV, in a population of dogs in the south east of England, has been shown previously to be 30.1% on the first day of entry to a rehoming kennel [Erles, K., Toomey, C., Brooks, H.W., Brownlie, J., 2003. Detection of a group 2 coronavirus in dogs with canine infectious respiratory disease. Virology 310, 216\u2013223]. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of CRCoV in the general canine population within as well as outside the UK. An ELISA, used to test for the presence of antibodies to CRCoV in canine serum samples, identified seropositive dogs in UK, USA, Canada, Republic of Ireland and Greece. The development of an ELISA based on CRCoV antigen and immunofluorescence assay are described here. 54.7% (547/1000) of North American and 36.0% (297/824) of United Kingdom dogs were seropositive for CRCoV. The age and geographical distribution of seropositive dogs was also assessed. The cross-reactivity demonstrated between CRCoV antibodies from different countries and a UK viral isolate suggests immunological similarity. The overall prevalence of this virus in both North America and the UK suggests that CRCoV has international significance and that further epidemiological studies are required.","publish_time":"2006-06-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Priestnall, Simon L.; Brownlie, Joe; Dubovi, Edward J.; Erles, Kerstin","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/34426e92b71304b46db047c30aef3444b6dd7930.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117349.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811350600071X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811350600071X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Brooks"],"organizations":["UK"],"locations":["England","Republic of Ireland","Greece","North America"],"keyphrases":["CRCoV antibodies","prevalence of CRCoV","CRCoV antigen","canine enteric coronavirus","population of dogs","Abstract Canine respiratory coronavirus","canine infectious respiratory disease","canine serum samples","general canine population","bovine coronavirus","geographical distribution of seropositive dogs","United Kingdom dogs","prevalence of serum antibodies","UK viral isolate","presence of antibodies","group","overall prevalence","ELISA","immunological similarity","North America","different countries","Canada","USA","important role","international significance","BCoV","rehoming kennel","bacterial infections","Republic of Ireland","Erles","age","CECoV","CIRD","south east of England","day of entry","immunofluorescence assay","cross-reactivity","Toomey","epidemiological studies","Greece","primary pathogen","Brooks","study","Detection","development","Brownlie","purpose","Virology"],"language":"en"},

In 2013, imported human H7N9 influenza infected cases from China were reported. Our study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) concerning A/H7N9 among Hong Kong general population regarding pandemic preparedness in early 2014. METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based telephone survey study was conducted among the Cantonese-speaking population aged over 15 years in Hong Kong in February 2014. The study survey was composed of 78 KAP questions. Factors associated with individual and household pandemic preparedness were analyzed. RESULTS: Final study sample was 1,020 with a response rate of 45.9 %. Among the respondents, most of them believed personal hygiene and avoidance of avian contacts were effective in preventing H7N9 infections. The majority of respondents had satisfactory hand hygiene practices and avoided touching avian species but did not employ other preventive measures. Female, 25 years old or older, white collar workers, people with chronic diseases and people living in the city center tended to report better hygiene practices. The average State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score was 1.85, similar to that of the period during the first wave and at the start of the second wave of the H7N9 epidemic. Self-reported face masks wearing when having influenza-like illness in general population dropped from 92.4 % during H5N1 period in 2007 to 39.0 % in this study. CONCLUSION: Hong Kong citizens show a low level of anxiety, misconceptions regarding the novel strains as well as gaps between perceived usefulness and practice of preventive measures towards influenza outbreaks. Educational campaigns and framing the issue to increase public and media awareness are crucial in preventing the current public fatigue towards outbreaks.","publish_time":"2015-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chan, Emily YY; Cheng, Calvin KY; Tam, Greta; Huang, Zhe; Lee, Poyi","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4fe4eefd0cb0263c466d4e7895fcfec52b502a21.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4579795.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-2245-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26395243/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4NjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KAP"],"locations":["China","Hong Kong"],"keyphrases":["Hong Kong general population","H7N9 epidemic","study survey","Hong Kong citizens","population-based telephone survey study","influenza outbreaks","H7N9 infections","Final study sample","people","personal hygiene","better hygiene practices","general community","human H7N9 influenza infected cases","major epidemic risks","practice of preventive measures","SARS epidemic","wave","satisfactory hand hygiene practices","household pandemic preparedness","chronic diseases","years old","avian species","majority of respondents","KAP questions","H5N1 period","repeated infectious diseases health risks","low level of anxiety","avoidance of avian contacts","current public fatigue","Self-reported face masks","average State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score","white collar workers","perceived usefulness","issue","gaps","misconceptions","China","city center","media awareness","novel strains","knowledge","Factors","Female","attitude","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","Cantonese","illness","response rate","Educational campaigns","BACKGROUND","METHODS","start"],"language":"en"},

While vaccination is available against the major cancer-causing HPV types, many others are not covered by these preventive measures. Herein, we present a bioinformatics study for the designing of multivalent peptide vaccines against multiple HPV types as an alternative strategy to the virus-like particle vaccines being used now. Our technique of rational design of peptide vaccines is expected to ensure stability of the vaccine against many cycles of mutational changes, elicit immune response, and negate autoimmune possibilities. Using the L1 capsid protein sequences, we identified several peptides for potential vaccine design for HPV 16, 18, 33, 35, 45, and 11 types. Although there are concerns about the epitope-binding affinities for the peptides identified in this process, the technique indicates possibilities of multivalent, adjuvanted, peptide vaccines against a wider range of HPV types, and tailor-made different combinations of the peptides to address frequency variations of types over different population groups as required for prophylaxis and at lower cost than are in use at the present time.","publish_time":"2016-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dey, Sumanta; De, Antara; Nandy, Ashesh","journal":"Cancer Inform","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffe133ed880d6c77ae340c5374817232e21f8315.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4890726.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4137/cin.s39071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27279731/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU0LmNzdjs4NjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1698155,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"v2mEGfKAK6I/YLcutR1KRQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_54.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["multiple HPV types","wider range of HPV types","major cancer-causing HPV types","peptides","frequency variations of types","designing of multivalent peptide vaccines","particle vaccines","technique of rational design of peptide vaccines","possibilities of multivalent","potential vaccine design","autoimmune possibilities","present time","tailor-made different combinations","different population groups","immune response","alternative strategy","prophylaxis","cycles of mutational changes","use","stability","L1 capsid protein sequences","bioinformatics study","lower cost","vaccination","epitope-binding affinities","process","genital","cancers","Human papillomavirus","preventive measures"],"language":"en"},

Results: Older age and a high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. Age was comparable between men and women in all data sets. In the case series, however, men\u0027s cases tended to be more serious than women\u0027s (P = 0.035). In the public data set, the number of men who died from COVID-19 is 2.4 times that of women (70.3 vs. 29.7%, P = 0.016). In SARS patients, the gender role in mortality was also observed. The percentage of males were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (P = 0.015).

Objectives: To determine the frequency of detection of infectious agents in a population of hospitalized foals with diarrhea and to determine if detection of specific pathogens is associated with age, outcome, or clinicopathologic data. Animals: Two hundred and thirty\u2010three foals \u2264 10 months of age with diarrhea examined at a referral institution. Methods: Retrospective case series. Each foal was examined for Salmonella spp., viruses, Clostridium difficile toxins, Clostridium perfringens culture, C. perfringens enterotoxin, Cryptosporidium spp., and metazoan parasites in feces collected at admission or at the onset of diarrhea. Results: At least 1 infectious agent was detected in 122 foals (55%). Rotavirus was most frequently detected (20%) followed by C. perfringens (18%), Salmonella spp. (12%), and C. difficile (5%). Foals \u003C 1 month of age were significantly more likely to be positive for C. perfringens (odds ratio [OR] = 15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.5\u201366) or to have negative fecal diagnostic results (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.7\u20135.2) than older foals.

The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) \u2212336A\u003EG in the CD209 promoter has been demonstrated to regulate promoter activity and to be associated with several important infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus\u20131 (HIV-1), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Dengue fever. CD209 facilitates severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013coronavirus spike protein-bearing pseudotype driven infection of permissive cells in vitro. In keeping with previously published findings, our in vitro studies confirmed that this SNP modulates gene promoter activity. Genetic association analysis of this SNP with clinico-pathologic outcomes in 824 serologic confirmed SARS patients showed that the \u2212336AG/GG genotype SARS patients was associated with lower standardized lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) levels compared with the \u2212336AA patients (p = 0.014, odds ratio = 0.40). High LDH levels are known to be an independent predictor for poor clinical outcome, probably related to tissue destruction from immune hyperactivity. Hence, SARS patients with the CD209 \u2212336 AA genotype carry a 60% chance of having a poorer prognosis.

However, as bats are sometimes blown out to sea, and have colonised isolated islands, occasional natural movement between the New and Old Worlds does appear to be possible. Here we identify new genotypes of a blood parasite, Trypanosoma dionisii, in Old World bats that are closely related to South American strains. Using highly conservative calibration points, divergence of Old and New World strains is estimated to have occurred 3.2\u20135.0 million years ago (MYA), depending on the method used (upper 95% CL for maximum time 11.4 MYA). The true date of divergence is likely to be considerably more recent.

A diagnostic strategy that clarifies these uncertainties could enable personalized asthma treatment and mitigate antibiotic overuse. OBJECTIVES: To explore the performance of validated peripheral blood gene expression signatures in discriminating bacterial, viral, and noninfectious triggers in subjects with asthma exacerbations. METHODS: Subjects with suspected asthma exacerbations of various etiologies were retrospectively selected for peripheral blood gene expression analysis from a pool of subjects previously enrolled in emergency departments with acute respiratory illness. RT-PCR quantified 87 gene targets, selected from microarray-based studies, followed by logistic regression modeling to define bacterial, viral, or noninfectious class. The model-predicted class was compared to clinical adjudication and procalcitonin. RESULTS: Of 46 subjects enrolled, 7 were clinically adjudicated as bacterial, 18 as viral, and 21 as noninfectious. Model prediction was congruent with clinical adjudication in 15/18 viral and 13/21 noninfectious cases, but only 1/7 bacterial cases. None of the adjudicated bacterial cases had confirmatory microbiology; the precise etiology in this group was uncertain. Procalcitonin classified only one subject in the cohort as bacterial. 47.8% of subjects received antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Our model classified asthma exacerbations by the underlying bacterial, viral, and noninfectious host response. Compared to clinical adjudication, the majority of discordances occurred in the bacterial group, due to either imperfect adjudication or model misclassification. Bacterial infection was identified infrequently by all classification schemes, but nearly half of subjects were prescribed antibiotics. A gene expression-based approach may offer useful diagnostic information in this population and guide appropriate antibiotic use.","publish_time":"2019-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lydon, Emily C.; Bullard, Charles; Aydin, Mert; Better, Olga M.; Mazur, Anna; Nicholson, Bradly P.; Ko, Emily R.; McClain, Micah T.; Ginsburg, Geoffrey S.; Woods, Chris W.; Burke, Thomas W.; Henao, Ricardo; Tsalik, Ephraim L.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c3ceccabeff0296e424a649fe5931a1671f9905.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6453459.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0214871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30958855/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial group","Bacterial infection","adjudicated bacterial cases","noninfectious cases","model classified asthma exacerbations","viral remains","clinical adjudication","pool of subjects","noninfectious triggers","noninfectious class","gene expression-based approach","gene targets","imperfect adjudication","Model prediction","model misclassification","peripheral blood gene expression analysis","suspected asthma exacerbations of various etiologies","personalized asthma treatment","noninfectious host response","model-predicted class","performance of validated peripheral blood gene expression signatures","procalcitonin","antibiotic overuse","diagnostic strategy","prescribed antibiotics","microarray-based studies","useful diagnostic information","appropriate antibiotic use","emergency departments","population","confirmatory microbiology","precise etiology","logistic regression modeling","uncertainties","acute respiratory illness","majority of discordances","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RT-PCR","classification schemes","cohort","RATIONALE","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

This poses a challenge to maintain appropriate patient care while preventing a significant backlog of patients once stay-at-home restrictions are lifted. In practices that are naive to telehealth as an alternative option, providers and staff are experiencing challenges with telemedicine implementation. We aim to provide a comprehensive guide on how to rapidly integrate telemedicine into practice during a pandemic. METHODS: We built a toolkit that details 8 essential components to successful implementation of a telemedicine platform: Provider and staff training, patient education, an existing electronic medical record system, patient and provider investment in hardware, billing and coding integration, information technology support, audiovisual platforms, and patient and caregiver participation. RESULTS: Rapid integration of telemedicine in our practice was required to be compliant with our institution\u2019s COVID-19 Taskforce. Within 3 days of this declaration, our large specialty-care clinic converted to a telemedicine platform and we completed 638 visits within the first month of implementation.

FCoV can be divided into serotypes I and II. The virus that causes FIP (FIPV) is believed to occur sporadically and spread infrequently from cat to cat. Recently, an FIP outbreak from an animal shelter was confirmed in Taiwan. FCoV from all the cats in this shelter were analyzed to determine the epidemiology of this outbreak. Thirteen of 46 (28.2%) cats with typical signs of FIP were identified. Among them, seven cats were confirmed by necropsy and/or histopathological examinations. Despite the fact that more than one FCoV was identified in this multi-cat environment, the eight FIP cats were invariably found to be infected with a type II FCoV. Sequence analysis revealed that the type II FIPV detected from fecal samples, body effusions and granulomatous tissue homogenates from the cats that succumbed to FIP all harbored an identical recombination site in their S gene. Two of the cats that succumbed to FIP were found to harbor an identical nonsense mutation in the 3c gene. Fecal shedding of this type II virus in the effusive form of FIP can be detected up to six days before death. Taken together, our data demonstrate that horizontal transmission of FIPV is possible and that FIP cats can pose a potential risk to other cats living in the same environment.","publish_time":"2013-07-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ying-Ting; Su, Bi-Ling; Hsieh, Li-En; Chueh, Ling-Ling","journal":"Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e9c899d06f0e31a0d2c58cd4d82edb0086f9ed04.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3720556.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23865689/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-44-57","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs1OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FIPV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIP cats","FIP outbreak","FCoV","effusive form of FIP","typical signs of FIP","multi-cat environment","horizontal transmission of FIPV","fecal samples","feline coronavirus","Fecal shedding","c gene","S gene","animal shelter","identical recombination site","identical nonsense mutation","Feline infectious peritonitis","body effusions","granulomatous tissue homogenates","fatal disease","potential risk","data","necropsy","infection","Sequence analysis","histopathological examinations","Taiwan","epidemiology","days","death","serotypes","fact"],"language":"en"},

Recently we have successfully developed transgenic mice expressing human scavenger receptor class B member 2 (hSCARB2, a receptor of EV71 and CVA16) as an animal model for evaluating the pathogenesis of enterovirus infections. In this study, hSCARB2-transgenic mice were used to investigate the efficacy conferred by a previously described EV71 neutralizing antibody, N3. A single injection of N3 effectively inhibited the HFMD-like skin scurfs in mice pre-infected with clinical isolate of EV71 E59 (B4 genotype) or prevented severe limb paralysis and death in mice pre-inoculated with 5746 (C2 genotype). This protection was correlated with remarkable reduction of viral loads in the brain, spinal cord and limb muscles. Accumulated viral loads and the associated pro-inflammatory cytokines were all reduced. The protective efficacy of N3 was not observed in animals challenged with CVA16. This could be due to dissimilarity sequences of the neutralizing epitope found in CVA16. These results indicate N3 could be useful in treating severe EV71 infections and the hSCARB2-transgenic mouse could be used to evaluate the protective efficacy of potential anti-enterovirus agent candidates.","publish_time":"2013-07-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chang, Hsuen-Wen; Lin, Yi-Wen; Ho, Hui-Min; Lin, Min-Han; Liu, Chia-Chyi; Shao, Hsiao-Yun; Chong, Pele; Sia, Charles; Chow, Yen-Hung","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c4e5c3ffe90100931729abab4aa1155d8c145816.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3728341.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23936115/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069858","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2MjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CVA16","receptor of EV71","hSCARB2-transgenic mice","severe EV71 infections","described EV71","protective efficacy of N3","mice pre-infected","mice pre-inoculated","hSCARB2-transgenic mouse","severe limb paralysis","clinical isolate of EV71 E59","HFMD","pathogenesis of enterovirus infections","single injection of N3","protective efficacy of potential anti-enterovirus agent candidates","Accumulated viral loads","B4 genotype","severe public health issue","remarkable reduction of viral loads","limb muscles","C2 genotype","neutralizing epitope","human scavenger receptor class B member","brain","death","spinal cord","skin scurfs","associated pro-inflammatory cytokines","mouth diseases","Asian-Pacific region","children","animal model","coxsackievirus","Hand-foot","dissimilarity sequences","antibody","study","protection","results","animals"],"language":"en"},

In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. METHODS: This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mohamed, Ayman; Alawna, Motaz","journal":"Diabetes Metab Syndr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cf014eeb915d0767a4ff661bb50f416a7dad2807.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7186129.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388326/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187140212030103X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187140212030103X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2NDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["strength of immune","overcoming COVID","respiratory systems","counter COVID","progression of COVID","strength of specific immune","respiratory functions","aerobic capacity","function of immune cells","respiratory elements essential","respiratory system functions","infections","long term effects","antimycotic","short-term safe improvements","normal lung tissue elasticity","Scopus","EBSCO","clinical trials","literature","systematic reviews","CRP levels","immunoglobulins","antibiotic","potential","Web of Science","Medline databases","associated disorders","critical element","anxiety","antioxidant","public world crisis","protective barrier","risk factors","depression","search","immunity","incidence","BACKGROUND","AIMS","self-limited infection","METHODS","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","mechanisms"],"language":"en"},

Acute respiratory tract infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract are caused by a wide variety of viral and bacterial pathogens, which require comprehensive laboratory investigations. Conventional serological and immunofluorescence-based diagnostic methods for acute respiratory tract infections lack sensitivity when compared to polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches and the development of new diagnostic methodologies is required, to provide accurate, sensitive and rapid diagnoses. In the present study, a PCR-based low density oligonucleotide microarray was developed for the detection of 16 viral and two atypical bacterial pathogens. The performance of this DNA microarray-based analysis exhibited comparable sensitivities and specificities to multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (rtPCRs) confirming the potential diagnostic utility of the method. In contrast to routine multiplex PCR, the microarray incorporates an intrinsic redundancy as multiple and non-identical probes per target on the array allow direct intra-assay confirmation of positives.

This study tried to explore the dentist manpower development and the current status of geographical distribution of dentists in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used the secondary data analysis to survey the changes of total dentist number from 1986 to 2018 and the geographic distribution of dentists in different levels of dental institutions in 2019. RESULTS: The total number of dentists increased from 3739 in 1986 to 14,717 in 2018. The total number of hospital dentists increased from 809 in 1986 to 2121 in 2018. However, the proportion of hospital dentists in the total number of dentists decreased from 21.64% in 1986 to 14.41% in 2018. On the contrary, the total number of dental clinic dentists increased from 2930 in 1986 to 12,596 in 2018. The proportion of dental clinic dentists in the total number of dentists increased from 78.36% in 1986 to 85.59% in 2018. The northern region of Taiwan and Taipei City had 52.81% (7829/14,825) and 22.29% (3304/14,825) of the total number of dentists in 2019, respectively. Hospital dentists showed a significantly greater imbalance in geographic distribution than overall dentists. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that Taiwan has the problems of oversupply of dentists and imbalance in geographical distribution of dentists. Because continuation of the current dentist manpower development may accelerate the oversupply and geographical imbalance of dentists, a mechanism for controlling the total dentist manpower should be implemented to prevent the deterioration of the problems.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Feng-Chou; Yu-Fong Chang, Julia; Lin, Tzu-Chiang; Chang, Wen-Chiung; Chang, Yung-Ta; Chiang, Chun-Pin","journal":"J Dent Sci","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/89c19f9d1ed6485d0b80d1b87e83a905f9c15d8a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173809.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1991790220300726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32322365/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1991790220300726; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jds.2020.04.004","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs2ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Taiwan"],"keyphrases":["total number of dentists","development of dentists","overall dentists","total number of hospital dentists","geographical imbalance of dentists","geographic distribution of dentists","total number of dental clinic dentists","proportion of hospital dentists","proportion of dental clinic dentists","current status of geographical distribution of dentists","total dentist manpower","changes of total dentist number","current dentist manpower development","greater imbalance","problems of oversupply","northern region of Taiwan","study","RESULTS","different levels of dental institutions","mechanism","secondary data analysis","Taipei City","continuation","METHODS","PURPOSE","MATERIALS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","deterioration","century"],"language":"en"},

Human noroviruses are responsible for widespread outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis and represent one of the most common causes of foodborne illness. No vaccine or antiviral treatment options are available for norovirus infection. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of noroviruses is a key enzyme responsible for transcription and replication of the viral genome. Here, we review the progress made in understanding the structures and functions of norovirus RdRp and its use as a target for small molecule inhibitors. Crystal structures of the RdRp at different stages of substrate interaction have been determined, which shed light on its multi-step catalytic cycle. The in vitro assays and in vivo animal models that have been developed to identify and characterize inhibitors of norovirus RdRp are also summarized, followed by an update on the current antiviral research targeting different regions of norovirus RdRp. In the future, structure-based drug design and rational optimization of known nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors of norovirus RdRp may pave the way towards the next generation of direct-acting antivirals.","publish_time":"2017-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Deval, Jerome; Jin, Zhinan; Chuang, Ying-Chih; Kao, C.

Analysis of the stability of the hRSV and hMPV genomes revealed that nasopharyngeal aspirates could be stored at room temperature for up to 1 month without significant loss of detection. hRSV was detected by antigen testing and by real-time PCR; hMPV was detected by real-time PCR only. The hRSV antigen test was less sensitive than PCR, and failed to detect one-third of the hRSV infections. Overall, 54 (6.9%) and 306 (39.3%) of the 778 samples were positive for hMPV and hRSV, respectively.

However, the effect of exacerbations in young children with CF is not fully understood. We sought to characterize the frequency and clinical impact of PEx in a pilot study of infants and pre-school aged children with CF. METHODS: Thirty young children with CF [median (range) 1.5 years (0.2\u20134.9)] were prospectively followed for 2 years. Exacerbation frequency (hospitalizations and outpatient antibiotic use) was determined. Chest radiographs were performed at enrollment and study completion and assigned a Brasfield score. Lung function at age 7 years was assessed in a subset of children. The association between PEx frequency, chest radiograph score, and lung function was determined using Spearman correlation coefficients and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Correlations with an absolute magnitude of 0.3 or greater were considered clinically significant. RESULTS: Over 2 years, participants experienced a median of two PEx (range 0\u201313). Chest radiograph scores at enrollment and study completion were inversely associated with PEx frequency (R = \u22120.48 and R = \u22120.44, respectively). The association between frequency of PEx and lung function [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1))] at age 7 years was small (R = 0.20). Higher forced vital capacity (FVC) at 7 years was associated with more frequent PEx during the study (R = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Children with worse chest radiograph scores had more frequent PEx over the subsequent 2 years, suggesting a group of patients at higher risk for PEx. Frequent PEx in infants and young children with CF were not associated with lower FEV(1) and FVC at 7 years, although spirometry in this age group may not be a sensitive marker of mild lung disease and disease progression.

Therefore, they depend on a wide variety of cellular functions and structures, such as the host cell nucleus. It has been shown that DNA, as well as RNA viruses, exploit the nucleus because it provides essential machinery for viral replication. On the other hand, the nucleus undergoes significant remodelling during viral usurpation or exploitation. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that some subnuclear structures, such as promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies, act as an antiviral defence mechanism, and several viruses antagonize this intracellular defence by modifying subnuclear structures. This article reviews the main alterations that take place in nucleus during viral infections.","publish_time":"2011-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zakaryan, H.; Stamminger, T.","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c087ca451d47a08bb71d1369546aa9e107099371.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7162193.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21501365/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2011.01596.x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3NDk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["subnuclear structures","viral replication","viral usurpation","RNA viruses","host cell nucleus","viral infections","intracellular defence","antiviral defence mechanism","act","promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies","significant remodelling","place","wide variety of cellular functions","exploitation","main alterations","essential machinery","limited coding capacity","hand","article","proteins","DNA"],"language":"en"},

In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). This revealed the presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses (Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae), a retro-transcribing DNA virus (Hepadnaviridae), and a single-stranded DNA virus (Parvoviridae). These viruses comprise multi-host generalist viruses and those that are host-specific, indicative of both virome connectivity and heterogeneity. Virome connectivity was apparent in two well described multi-host virus species (avian coronavirus and influenza A virus) and a novel Rotavirus species that were shared among some Anseriform species, while heterogeneity was reflected in the absence of viruses shared between Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Notably, within avian host families there was no significant relationship between either host taxonomy or foraging ecology and virome composition, although Anseriform species positive for influenza A virus harboured more additional viruses than those negative for influenza virus. Overall, we demonstrate complex virome structures across host species that co-exist in multi-species aggregations.","publish_time":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wille, Michelle; Shi, Mang; Klaassen, Marcel; Hurt, Aeron C.; Holmes, Edward C.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/395e8569a0e6fc129029cb0b8cda1f7381954976.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5cda11611ad1158b9fa2131005c1d58bce41a815.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/528174","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host species","multi-host virus species","avian species","multi-species aggregations","viral species","multi-host generalist viruses","host taxonomy","host-specific","influenza virus","Models of host","single-host population","avian host families","Anseriform species positive","novel Rotavirus species","single-stranded RNA viruses","single-stranded DNA virus","additional viruses","absence of viruses","double-stranded RNA viruses","virome connectivity","virome composition","retro-transcribing DNA virus","single pathogen","avian coronavirus","complex virome structures","Anseriformes","heterogeneity","Charadriiformes","Reoviridae","Caliciviridae","foraging ecology","significant relationship","Astroviridae","Picobirnaviridae","Picornaviridae","viromes","Hepadnaviridae","ducks","indicative","microbe dynamics","hosts","Parvoviridae","meta-transcriptomic approach","reality","shorebirds","presence","assemblage of pathogens"],"language":"en"},

Nasal swabs were collected from 200 under-five children hospitalized with clinical signs of ARIs. Nasal swabs from 30 asymptomatic children were also collected. Screening of viral pathogens targeted ten respiratory viruses using RT-qPCR. Bacterial pathogens were identified by bacteriological culture methods and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined following CLSI guidelines. About 82.5% (n = 165) of specimens were positive for pathogens. Of 165 infected cases, 3% (n = 6) had only single bacterial pathogens, whereas 43.5% (n = 87) cases had only single viral pathogens. The remaining 36% (n = 72) cases had coinfections. In symptomatic cases, human rhinovirus was detected as the predominant virus (31.5%), followed by RSV (31%), HMPV (13%), HBoV (11%), HPIV-3 (10.5%), and adenovirus (7%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogen (9%), whereas Klebsiella pneumaniae, Streptococcus spp., Enterobacter agglomerans, and Haemophilus influenzae were 5.5%, 5%, 2%, and 1.5%, respectively. Of 15 multidrug-resistant bacteria, a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate and an Enterobacter agglomerans isolate exhibited resistance against more than 10 different antibiotics. Both ARI incidence and predominant pathogen detection rates were higher during post-monsoon and winter, peaking in September. Pathogen detection rates and coinfection incidence in less than 1-year group were significantly higher (P = 0.0034 and 0.049, respectively) than in 1\u20135 years age group. Pathogen detection rate (43%) in asymptomatic cases was significantly lower compared to symptomatic group (P\u003C0.0001). Human rhinovirus, HPIV-3, adenovirus, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Klebsiella pneumaniae had significant involvement in coinfections with P values of 0.0001, 0.009 and 0.0001, 0.0001 and 0.001 respectively.

The initial stages of the infection of a host by a virus involve a series of specific contact interactions between molecules in the host and on the virus surface. The strength of the interaction is quantified in the literature by the dissociation constant (K(d)) which is determined experimentally and is specific for a given virus molecule/host molecule combination. Here, two stages of the initial infection process of host intestinal cells are modelled, namely escape of the virus in the oral challenge dose from the innate host defenses (e.g. mucin proteins in mucus) and the subsequent binding of any surviving virus to receptor molecules on the surface of the host epithelial cells. The strength of virus binding to host cells and to mucins may be quantified by the association constants, K(a) and K(mucin), respectively. Here, a mechanistic dose-response model for the probability of infection of a host by a given virus dose is constructed using K(a) and K(mucin) which may be derived from published K(d) values taking into account the number of specific molecular interactions. It is shown that the effectiveness of the mucus barrier is determined not only by the amount of mucin but also by the magnitude of K(mucin). At very high K(mucin) values, slight excesses of mucin over virus are sufficient to remove all the virus according to the model. At lower K(mucin) values, high numbers of virus may escape even with large excesses of mucin. The output from the mechanistic model is the probability (p(1)) of infection by a single virion which is the parameter used in conventional dose-response models to predict the risk of infection of the host from the ingested dose. It is shown here how differences in K(a) (due to molecular differences in an emerging virus strain or new host) affect p(1), and how these differences in K(a) may be quantified in terms of two thermodynamic parameters, namely enthalpy and entropy. This provides the theoretical link between sequencing data and risk of infection. Lack of data on entropy is a limitation at present and may also affect our interpretation of K(d) in terms of infectivity. It is concluded that thermodynamic approaches have a major contribution to make in developing dose-response models for emerging viruses.","publish_time":"2018-01-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gale, Paul","journal":"Microb Risk Anal","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1a3f45ac97281b2eec0d578f579186849c7acbe1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103988.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352352217301561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32289059/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352352217301561; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mran.2018.01.002","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs3NzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["given virus dose","host cells","virus surface","surviving virus","new host","emerging virus strain","given virus molecule","strength of virus binding","risk of infection","mucin proteins","host epithelial cells","high numbers of virus","probability of infection","host molecule combination","innate host defenses","initial infection process of host intestinal cells","lack of dose response data","ingested dose","mechanistic dose-response model","slight excesses of mucin","large excesses of mucin","developing dose-response models","conventional dose-response models","emerging viruses","values","oral challenge dose","Lack of data","mechanistic model","molecular differences","existing viruses","number of specific molecular interactions","sequencing data","entropy","mucus barrier","initial stages","series of specific contact interactions","subsequent binding","receptor molecules","species barrier","thermodynamic parameters","thermodynamic approaches","terms of infectivity","account","major contribution","novel hosts","theoretical link","mucins","literature","dissociation constant","enthalpy","limitation","single virion","interpretation","effectiveness","output","magnitude","association constants"],"language":"en"},

The purpose of present study is to investigate the wind induced air pollutant transmission and cross contamination routes in typical buildings. In this paper, a series of experiments was carried out in a boundary layer wind tunnel using a 1:30 scaled model that represented the typical configuration of rectangular multi-storey residential buildings in Shanghai. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was employed as tracer gas in the wind tunnel tests. The conditions under two ventilation modes, i.e. single-sided natural ventilation and cross natural ventilation, were compared. The tracer gas concentration distributions under four approaching wind angles were monitored and analyzed. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method was adopted to assist in analyzing airflow patterns. The experiment results elucidated that in the two ventilation scenarios, both of the vertical and horizontal inter-flat airborne transmission could proceed. The wind direction played a key role on the pollutant concentration distribution. Compared with the single-sided ventilation mode, cross ventilation could weaken the air pollutant dispersion along the vertical direction when the contamination source was on the windward or on the leeward unit. When the wind blowing parallelly to the source unit window, namely the source room was on the sideward, cross ventilation would not suppress the vertical transport on one hand, but reinforce the horizontal transmission on the other hand. The study is helpful for the analysis of infection risk of respiratory diseases in the residential buildings.","publish_time":"2016-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mu, Di; Gao, Naiping; Zhu, Tong","journal":"Building and Environment","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/16b708aa771f7acad4f74a79079c2704f1a68304.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7111322.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2016.08.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287967/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132316303341; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132316303341","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4MzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Computational Fluid Dynamics"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cross ventilation","cross natural ventilation","ventilation modes","ventilation scenarios","wind direction","single-sided natural ventilation","air pollutant transmission","single-sided ventilation mode","wind tunnel tests","air pollutant dispersion","approaching wind angles","vertical direction","typical buildings","contamination source","horizontal transmission","boundary layer wind tunnel","cross contamination routes","pollutant concentration distribution","vertical transport","horizontal inter-flat airborne transmission","source room","source unit window","hand","inter-flat dispersion of hazardous air pollutants","typical configuration of rectangular multi-storey residential buildings","tracer gas concentration distributions","residential built environment","leeward unit","purpose of present study","key role","analysis of infection risk of respiratory diseases","growing concern","Computational Fluid Dynamics","CFD","method","SF6","Shanghai","scaled model","series of experiments","urban areas","paper","Sulfur hexafluoride","conditions","experiment results","airflow patterns"],"language":"en"},

Currently, diagnosis of COPD relies on largely descriptive measures to enable classification, such as symptoms and lung function. Here the limitations of existing diagnostic strategies of COPD are discussed and systems biology approaches to diagnosis that build upon current molecular knowledge of the disease are described. These approaches rely on new \u0027label-free\u0027 sensing technologies, such as high-throughput surface plasmon resonance (SPR), that we also describe.","publish_time":"2009-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Richens, Joanna L; Urbanowicz, Richard A; Lunt, Elizabeth AM; Metcalf, Rebecca; Corne, Jonathan; Fairclough, Lucy; O\u0027Shea, Paul","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1eb37c6ac1e51907a8a1d5f31c45fff08737cb36.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2678087.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19386108/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1465-9921-10-29","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs4NTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["COPD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diagnosis of COPD","manifestations of disease","systemic disease","preventable disease state","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","limitations of existing diagnostic strategies of COPD","lung function","systems biology approaches","high-throughput surface plasmon resonance","sensing technologies","progressive airflow limitation","label-free","current molecular knowledge","SPR","classification","notion","descriptive measures","symptoms","appreciation","lungs"],"language":"en"},

Studies suggest the billions of germs that compose the gut microbiota influence one\u2019s innate and adaptive immune responses at the intestinal level, but these microorganisms may also impact rheumatic diseases. The microbiota of the skin, respiratory and urinary tracts may also be relevant in rheumatology. Evidence indicates that changes in the gut microbiome alter the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis but also of other disorders like atherosclerosis and osteoarthritis. Therapeutic strategies to modify the microbiota, including probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation, have been received with skepticism, which, in turn, has drawn attention back to previously developed interventions such as antibiotics. Helminths adapted to humans over the evolution process, but their role in disease modulation, particularly immune-mediated diseases, remains to be understood.

Of the three enveloped viruses tested, human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 and porcine respiratory corona virus, only HSV-1 proved sensitive to the 3-HP-proteins. All of the chemically modified proteins presented antiviral activity against HSV-1 when assayed before, during or after infection.

In this article, we discuss the rationale, and review the results, of the use of antimalarial quinolines, such as chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine, to counteract immune activation in HIV infection. Despite the promising results of several pilot trials, the most recent clinical data indicate that antimalarial quinolines are unlikely to exert a marked beneficial effect on immune activation. Alternative approaches will likely be required to reproducibly decrease immune activation in the setting of HIV infection. If the quinoline-based strategies should nevertheless be pursued in future studies, particular care must be devoted to the dosage selection, in order to maximize the chances to obtain effective in vivo drug concentrations.","publish_time":"2015-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Savarino, Andrea; Shytaj, Iart Luca","journal":"Retrovirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/710a40e33a20fe517c78c06748005fea78f21105.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4472405.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12977-015-0178-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26084487/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["immune activation","cell activation","immune system","persistence of immune hyperactivation","setting of HIV infection","morbidity of HIV infection","use of antimalarial quinolines","T-cell recovery","promising results","recent clinical data","enhanced levels of T","main source of clinical concern","faster disease progression","slower CD4","pilot trials","marked beneficial effect","individuals","deleterious effects","chances","antiretroviral therapy","derivative hydroxychloroquine","future studies","particular care","order","drug concentrations","article","mortality","dosage selection","quinoline-based strategies","rationale","restoration","Alternative approaches"],"language":"en"},

In order to describe the feline gastrointestinal microbial diversity, fecal samples from cats have been characterized using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. However, data correlating total microbial composition and their functions are lacking. Present descriptive study evaluated both phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of the feline intestinal microbiota using GS Junior titanium shotgun pyrosequencing. A total of 152,494 pyrosequencing reads (5405 assembled contigs) were generated and classified into both phylogenetic and metabolic profiles of the feline intestinal microbiota. The Bacteroides/Chlorobi group was the most predominant bacterial phylum comprising ~68% of total classified diversity, followed by Firmicutes (~13%) and Proteobacteria (~6%) respectively. Archaea, fungi and viruses made up the minor communities in the overall microbial diversity. Interestingly, this study also identified a range of potential enteric zoonotic pathogens (0.02\u20131.25%) and genes involved in antimicrobial resistance (0.02\u20130.7%) in feline fecal materials. Based on clustering among nine gastrointestinal metagenomes from five different monogastric hosts (dog, human, mice, cat and chicken), the cat metagenome clustered closely together with chicken in both phylogenetic and metabolic level (\u003E80%).

CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the potential prognostic significance of selective high abundance serum APPs in patients with EOCa.","publish_time":"2009-08-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chen, Yeng; Lim, Boon-Kiong; Hashim, Onn H","journal":"J Hematol Oncol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/99e788920d9bc9e4792a54d4daa546045c04f9cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2739531.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19709441/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-8722-2-37","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HAP","AAT","LRG","CLU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of LRG","expression of ACT","sera of patients","general enhanced expression of \u03B1","stages of cancer","Different altered stage correlative expression","potential prognostic significance of selective high abundance serum APPs","RESULTS","AAT","EOCa","serum acute-phase proteins","initial stages","positive correlation","inverse correlation","altered progression changes","haptoglobin \u03B2-chain","epithelial ovarian carcinoma","leucine rich glycoprotein","clusterin","antichymotrypsin","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","present study"],"language":"en"},

Although there is no known cure for Ebola virus, there is some evidence that the severity of the disease can be curtailed using plasma from survivors. Although there is a general consensus on the importance of research, methodological and ethical challenges for conducting research in an emergency situation have been identified. Performing clinical trials is important, especially for health conditions that are of public health significance (including rare epidemics) to develop new therapies as well as to test the efficacy and effectiveness of new interventions. However, routine clinical trial procedures can be difficult to apply in emergency public health crises hence require a consideration of alternative approaches on how therapies in these situations are tested and brought to the market. This paper examines some of the ethical issues that arise when conducting clinical trials during a highly dangerous pathogen outbreak, with a special focus on the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa. The issues presented here come from a review of a protocol that was submitted to the Global Emerging Pathogens Treatment Consortium (GET). In reviewing the proposal, which was about conducting a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of using convalescent plasma in the management of Ebola virus disease, the authors deliberated on various issues, which were documented as minutes and later used as a basis for this paper. The experiences and reflections shared by the authors, who came from different regions and disciplines across Africa, present wide-ranging perspectives on the conduct of clinical trials during a dangerous disease outbreak in a resource-poor setting.","publish_time":"2016-01-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kombe, Francis; Folayan, Morenike O.; Ambe, Jennyfer; Igonoh, Adaora; Abayomi, Akin","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f3b8e8054ed4441a63f60b91f3381d1062a7813.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6858863.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953615302252; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.11.017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953615302252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26653137/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Global Emerging Pathogens Treatment Consortium"],"locations":["West Africa","Africa"],"keyphrases":["Ebola virus outbreak","dangerous disease outbreak","management of Ebola virus disease","conduct of clinical trials","Abstract Ebola virus","dangerous pathogens","ethical issues","dangerous pathogen outbreak","routine clinical trial procedures","public health significance","health conditions","emergency public health crises","authors","efficacy","new therapies","various issues","paper","importance of research","West Africa","convalescent plasma","ethical challenges","emergency situation","effectiveness of new interventions","Global Emerging Pathogens Treatment Consortium","present wide-ranging perspectives","special focus","disciplines","rare epidemics","safety","consideration of alternative approaches","different regions","resource-poor setting","evidence","general consensus","known cure","protocol","basis","situations","experiences","reflections","review","minutes","severity","world","survivors","market","proposal"],"language":"en"},

The ResPlex II assay was then used to test for 18 respiratory viruses on 48 used air filter samples from commercial aircraft. Three samples tested positive for viruses, and three viruses were detected: rhinovirus, influenza A and influenza B. For 33 of 48 samples, internal PCR controls performed suboptimally, suggesting sample matrix effect. Conclusion: In some cases, influenza and rhinovirus RNA can be detected on aircraft air filters, even more than 10 days after the filters were removed from aircraft.

The COVID-19 soon spread to other regions of China and overseas. In Hong Kong, local mitigation measures have been implemented since the first imported case was confirmed on January 23, 2020. Here we evaluated the temporal variation of detection delay from symptoms onset to laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong. Methods A regression model is adopted to quantify the association between the SARS-CoV-2 detection delay and the calendar time. The association is tested and further validated by a Cox proportional hazard model. Findings The estimated median detection delay was 9.5 days (95%CI: 6.5\u221211.5) in the second half of January, and reduced to 6.0 days (95%CI: 5.5\u22129.5) in the first half of February 2020. We estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 detection efficiency improves at a daily rate of 5.40% (95%CI: 2.54\u22128.33) in Hong Kong. Conclusion The detection efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 was likely being improved substantially in Hong Kong since the first imported case was detected.

This study examines the effect of shifting childbirth services from advanced hospitals (i.e., medical centers and regional hospitals) to local community hospitals (i.e., clinics and district hospitals). The sample population was tracked over a seven-year period, which includes the four months of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Taiwan. During the SARS epidemic, pregnant women avoided using maternity services in advanced hospitals. Concerns have been raised about maintaining the quality of maternity care with increased demands on childbirth services in local community hospitals. In this study, we analyzed the impact of shifting maternity services among hospitals of different levels on neonatal mortality and maternal deaths. METHODS: A population-based study was conducted using data from Taiwan\u0027s National Health Insurance annual statistics of monthly county neonatal morality rates. Based on a pre-SARS sample from January 1998 to December 2002, we estimated a linear regression model which included \u0022trend,\u0022 a continuous variable representing the effect of yearly changes, and two binary variables, \u0022month\u0022 and \u0022county,\u0022 controlling for seasonal and county-specific effects. With the estimated coefficients, we obtained predicted neonatal mortality rates for each county-month. We compared the differences between observed mortality rates of the SARS period and predicted rates to examine whether the shifting in maternity services during the SARS epidemic significantly affected neonatal mortality rates. RESULTS: With an analysis of a total of 1,848 observations between 1998 and 2004, an insignificantly negative mean of standardized predicted errors during the SARS period was found. The result of a sub-sample containing areas with advanced hospitals showed a significant negative mean of standardized predicted errors during the SARS period. These findings indicate that despite increased use of local community hospitals, neonatal mortality during the SARS epidemic did not increase, and even decreased in areas with advanced hospitals. CONCLUSION: An increased use of maternity services in local community hospitals occurred during the SARS epidemic in Taiwan. However, we observed no increase in neonatal and maternity mortality associated with these increased demands on local community hospitals.","publish_time":"2009-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Shi-Yi; Hsu, Sylvia H; Chen, Li-Kuei","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/323e747a1a351a6ec4053512e45718fc27d242d3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2703635.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19505330/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-9-94","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Insurance","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["advanced hospitals","regional hospitals","district hospitals","SARS epidemic","SARS period","increased use of local community hospitals","maternity mortality","hospitals of different levels","predicted neonatal mortality rates","increased use of maternity services","predicted rates","observed mortality rates","pre-SARS sample","effect of shifting childbirth services","increased demands","quality of maternity care","county-month","year period","sample population","population-based study","significant negative mean of standardized predicted errors","Taiwan\u0027s National Health Insurance annual statistics of monthly county neonatal morality rates","better childbirth care","county-specific effects","areas","sub-sample","estimated coefficients","effect of yearly changes","data","severe acute respiratory syndrome","medical centers","pregnant women","trend","clinics","continuous variable","maternal deaths","considerable discussion","binary variables","months","impact","analysis","linear regression model","METHODS","CONCLUSION","differences","total","observations","BACKGROUND","findings","RESULTS","Concerns"],"language":"en"},

However, its pathological characteristics were not adequately investigated. In our preliminary in vitro investigation, ECoV-induced cell death was observed in bovine kidney-derived MDBK cells. Based on this finding, we investigated whether the ECoV-induced CPE was apoptosis. Following ECoV infection, MDBK cells showed morphological changes such as cell rounding and detachment from the culture surface. Moreover, syncytium formation was observed as the other type of cytopathic effect in ECoV infection. Morphologic and biochemical features of apoptosis, such as nuclear fragmentation and DNA ladder formation, were also detected in ECoV-infected cells. Moreover, as is commonly observed in coronavirus infection in other animals, the activities of effecter caspases \u2013 caspase-3/7 \u2013 and initiator caspases \u2013 caspase-8 and caspase-9 \u2013 that are representative factors in the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, respectively, were increased in ECoV-infected MDBK cells. Therefore, it was suggested that ECoV can induce apoptosis in MDBK cells via a caspase-dependent pathway. Apoptotic death of infected cells is detrimental because it causes cell and tissue destruction and inflammatory responses. Although the pathological characteristics of ECoV are largely unknown, apoptosis may be the pathological basis of lesions of the digestive system in ECoV infection.","publish_time":"2008-06-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Suzuki, Kazuhiko; Matsui, Yusuke; Miura, Yasuo; Sentsui, Hiroshi","journal":"Veterinary Microbiology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5e624beceefc04a32829c64a6009daa0e2dbd18d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117270.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113507006104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18243587/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113507006104; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.11.034","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsxODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MDBK","CPE"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ECoV infection","ECoV-infected cells","ECoV-infected MDBK cells","pathological characteristics of ECoV","ECoV-induced cell death","ECoV-induced CPE","Apoptotic death of infected cells","coronavirus infection","caspase-dependent pathway","bovine kidney-derived MDBK cells","mitochondrial apoptotic pathway","death receptor","biochemical features of apoptosis","pathological basis of lesions","initiator caspases","syncytium formation","activities of effecter caspases","DNA ladder formation","Abstract Equine coronavirus","morphological changes","nuclear fragmentation","digestive system","animals","investigation","tissue destruction","type of cytopathic effect","detachment","inflammatory responses","representative factors","diarrheic foal","culture surface","group","coronaviruses","finding"],"language":"en"},

To minimize the impacts of future events, animal disease surveillance will need to enable prompt event detection and response. Diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance systems targeting domestic animals depend in large part on private veterinarians to submit samples from cases to a laboratory. In contexts where pre-diagnostic laboratory surveillance systems have been implemented, this group of veterinarians is often asked to input data. This scenario holds true in Alberta where private cattle veterinarians have been asked to participate in the Alberta Veterinary Surveillance Network-Veterinary Practice Surveillance, a platform to which pre-diagnostic disease and non-disease case data are submitted. Consequently, understanding the factors that influence these veterinarians to submit cases to a laboratory and the complex of factors that affect their participation in surveillance programs is foundational to interpreting disease patterns reported by laboratories and engaging veterinarians in surveillance. A focused ethnographic study was conducted with ten cattle veterinarians in Alberta. Individual in-depth interviews with participants were recorded and transcribed to enable thematic analysis. Laboratory submissions were biased toward outbreaks of unknown cause, cases with unusual mortality rates, and issues with potential herd-level implications. Decreasing cattle value and government support for laboratory testing have contributed to fewer submissions over time. Participants were willing participants in surveillance, though government support and collaboration were necessary. Changes in the beef industry and veterinary profession, as well as cattle producers themselves, present both challenges and opportunities in surveillance.","publish_time":"2013-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sawford, Kate; Vollman, Ardene Robinson; Stephen, Craig","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/721f194d7cd4953a229e067f3e1b79ec2cf22aca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3669388.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0064811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23741397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyMjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Alberta"],"keyphrases":["animal disease surveillance","surveillance programs","pre-diagnostic laboratory surveillance systems","Diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance systems","Alberta Veterinary Surveillance Network-Veterinary Practice Surveillance","Laboratory submissions","private cattle veterinarians","private veterinarians","laboratory testing","engaging veterinarians","group of veterinarians","pre-diagnostic disease","cases","disease patterns","cattle value","cattle producers","veterinary profession","non-disease case data","government support","willing participants","fewer submissions","complex of factors","issues","unusual mortality rates","domestic animals","platform","outbreaks of unknown cause","participation","challenges","potential herd-level implications","laboratories","contexts","impacts of future events","zoonotic emerging infectious diseases","beef industry","prompt event detection","collaboration","samples","public health communities","response","Individual in-depth interviews","Changes","focused ethnographic study","scenario","opportunities","time","thematic analysis"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: A set of four specific primers was designed to target the sequences of the pol gene of ALV, and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay were developed and compared with PCR and virus isolation methods. RESULTS: The results from specificity of the LAMP assay showed that only target ALVs DNA was amplified. The LAMP assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 20 copies/reaction of ALV DNA, which was 10 times higher than the conventional PCR measurement. To further evaluate the reliability of the method, the assay was evaluated with ALV DNA from a panel of 81 clinical samples suspected of ALV infection. The results verify that the LAMP method was more sensitive than the conventional PCR and virus isolation method. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the developed LAMP assay was a simple, inexpensive, sensitive method for the rapid detection of the most common subgroups of ALV, and it provided a useful and practical tool in the eradication program for ALV in the poultry industry.","publish_time":"2015-11-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peng, Hao; Qin, Lili; Bi, Yuyu; Wang, Peikun; Zou, Guangzhen; Li, Jun; Yang, Yongli; Zhong, Xingfu; Wei, Ping","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/36469337a42a7feb9bdefa958b364d2e269ec2ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4657318.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-015-0430-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26596553/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyNTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ALV","LAMP"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["eradication of ALV","ALV infection","common ALV subgroups","common subgroups of ALV","LAMP method","reaction of ALV DNA","developed LAMP assay","rapid method","sensitive method","pol gene of ALV","rapid detection","isothermal amplification","RESULTS","rapid real-time loop","virus isolation methods","major subgroups of avian leukosis virus","conventional PCR measurement","poultry industry","specific primers","isothermal conditions","target ALVs DNA","CONCLUSION","timely detection","eradication program","China","times higher","significant negative effect","copies","diagnosis","practical tool","infecting chickens","clinical samples","sequences","panel","sensitivity","specificity","set","urgent need","BACKGROUND","reliability"],"language":"en"},

Further, it requires sufficient discussions among related parties because the purpose of telemedicine is diagnosis and treatment, and the participation of medical specialists is essential. Based on the characteristics of the healthcare structure of Korea, which has a low proportion of public healthcare and most patients are taken care of by a few large tertiary care hospitals, the fundamental issues need to be discussed. METHODS: A comparison was conducted with overseas cases to discuss the prerequisites for the effective implementation of telemedicine in South Korea under the current situation. We also examined the structural characteristics of the Korean medical community. RESULTS: The current paper recommends that an in-depth analysis and studies are conducted on the following aspects: a search for telemedicine services focused on public healthcare, a search of services for illnesses that impose high levels of burden on households, and the development and implementation of a telemedicine system for follow-up management at primary and secondary care hospitals after the patient undergoes surgery or treatment at tertiary care hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: As the technology develops, the focus should also be on factors such as safety, usefulness, availability, and how the functions will be realized in order to enable user communication. A clear system should be established to regulate and manage the lack of sufficient discussions. In addition, seeking projects and systems that reflect the characteristics of each country will facilitate the efficient implementation of telemedicine.","publish_time":"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Hyeoi-Yun; Lee, Ji-San; Kim, Jeongeun","journal":"Healthc Inform Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/03a9a21fad1427fc2dbb6a4969627d0a76459597.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4659882.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.4258/hir.2015.21.4.251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26618031/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Korea"],"keyphrases":["telemedicine services","telemedicine system","efficient implementation of telemedicine","effective implementation of telemedicine","purpose of telemedicine","practice of telemedicine","secondary care hospitals","large tertiary care hospitals","treatment","search of services","healthcare structure of Korea","systems","structural characteristics","low proportion of public healthcare","lack of sufficient discussions","South Korea","current paper","current situation","clear system","participation of medical specialists","Korean medical community","follow-up management","surgery","social interventions","high levels of burden","households","illnesses","prerequisites","related parties","development","following aspects","fundamental issues","studies","in-depth analysis","diagnosis","patients","order","comparison","factors","availability","safety","usefulness","overseas cases","projects","country","technology","focus","user communication","functions","RESULTS","addition","OBJECTIVES","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, dendritic cells (DCs), professional antigen-presenting cells, link humoral and cellular immune responses for homeostasis of the intestinal immune environment. In this study, in order to explore an efficient oral vaccine against PEDV infection, a mucosal DC-targeting oral vaccine was developed using Lactobacillus casei to deliver the DC-targeting peptide (DCpep) fused with the PEDV core neutralizing epitope (COE) antigen. This probiotic vaccine could efficiently elicit secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based humoral immune responses via oral vaccination in vivo. Significant differences (p \u003C 0.05) in the immune response levels were observed between probiotics expressing the COE-DCpep fusion protein and COE antigen alone, suggesting better immune efficiency of the probiotics vaccine expressing the DC-targeting peptide fused with PEDV COE antigen.

The family Roniviridae contains viruses that are detected only in crustaceans, specifically, several genotypes of gill-associated and yellow head viruses. The host range of arteriviruses is highly restricted, and all arteriviruses share the capacity to establish asymptomatic prolonged or persistent infections in their respective natural hosts; most can cause severe disease in certain circumstances. The family Arteriviridae comprises a single genus, Arterivirus, which contains all member viruses, and the family Roniviridae contains a single genus, Okavirus. Arterivirus virions are enveloped, spherical, and 45\u201360 nm in diameter, which is only about half the size of those of coronaviruses. Arteriviruses replicate in macrophages and a very limited number of other cell types within their respective hosts. The host range of arteriviruses is highly restricted, and the viruses typically grow in vitro only in cultured macrophages, macrophage cell lines, and a few other cell lines. Some arteriviruses effectively can subvert protective host innate immune responses, including apoptosis of infected macrophages and interferon signaling pathways.","publish_time":"2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":null,"journal":"Fenner\u0027s Veterinary Virology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123751584000250; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123751584000250","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Roniviridae"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["host range of arteriviruses","family Roniviridae","member viruses","Arteriviruses replicate","family Arteriviridae","yellow head viruses","Publisher Summary Viruses","Roniviridae families","cultured macrophages","cell types","respective hosts","macrophage cell lines","single genus","protective host","apoptosis of infected macrophages","respective natural hosts","Arterivirus virions","persistent infections","grouping","nested set","immune responses","distinctive replication strategy","coterminal subgenomic messenger RNAs","different virion morphology","severe disease","limited number","mRNAs","interferon","capacity","genotypes of gill","certain circumstances","pathways","Okavirus","nm","crustaceans","size","coronaviruses","diameter"],"language":"en"},

Studies have found a relationship among temperature, humidity, and influenza virus incidence, transmission, or survival; however, there are contradictory claims about whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) is most important in mediating virus infectivity. Using the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for influenza viruses and coronaviruses, we designed a study to discern whether AH, RH, or temperature is a better predictor of virus survival in droplets. Our results show that Phi6 survived best at high (\u003E85%) and low (\u003C60%) RHs, with a significant decrease in infectivity at mid-range RHs (\u223C60 to 85%). At an AH of less than 22 g \u00B7 m(\u22123), the loss in infectivity was less than 2 orders of magnitude; however, when the AH was greater than 22 g \u00B7 m(\u22123), the loss in infectivity was typically greater than 6 orders of magnitude. At a fixed RH of 75%, infectivity was very sensitive to temperature, decreasing two orders of magnitude between 19\u00B0C and 25\u00B0C. We used random forest modeling to identify the best environmental predictors for modulating virus infectivity. The model explained 83% of variation in Phi6 infectivity and suggested that RH is the most important factor in controlling virus infectivity in droplets. This research provides novel information about the complex interplay between temperature, humidity, and the survival of viruses in droplets. IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses are responsible for a number of infectious diseases resulting in thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of economic losses per year in the United States. There has been a lively debate in the literature over whether absolute humidity (AH) or relative humidity (RH) modulates virus infectivity. We designed a controlled study and used advanced statistical modeling techniques specifically to address this question. By providing an improved understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and virus infectivity, our work will ultimately lead to improved strategies for predicting and controlling disease transmission.","publish_time":"2018-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prussin, Aaron J.; Schwake, David Otto; Lin, Kaisen; Gallagher, Daniel L.; Buttling, Lauren; Marr, Linsey C.","journal":"Appl Environ Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/011b8a7002da6c0fae7ca76c127567a6462daf5d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5981065.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29625986/; https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00551-18","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjszMzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","United States"],"keyphrases":["Phi6 infectivity","modulating virus infectivity","mediating virus infectivity","AH","relative humidity","absolute humidity","temperature","influenza virus incidence","influenza viruses","survival of viruses","better predictor of virus survival","fixed RH","droplets","orders of magnitude","IMPORTANCE Enveloped viruses","enveloped bacteriophage Phi6","billions of dollars","economic losses","relationship","year","cause thousands of deaths","best environmental predictors","number of infectious diseases","environmental conditions","Middle East respiratory syndrome","severe acute respiratory syndrome","important factor","controlled study","improved strategies","improved understanding","disease transmission","random forest modeling","mid-range RHs","advanced statistical modeling techniques","SARS","MERS","significant decrease","complex interplay","literature","work","novel information","coronaviruses","contradictory claims","United States","research","surrogate","variation","lively debate","question","Studies","results"],"language":"en"},

We assessed the compliance of health workers with infection prevention and control practices relevant to COVID-19 in outpatient settings in Tanzania, before the pandemic. Methods This study was based on a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected as part of a randomised controlled trial in private for-profit dispensaries and health centres and in faith-based dispensaries, health centres, and hospitals, in 18 regions. We observed provider\u2013patient interactions in outpatient consultation rooms, laboratories, and dressing rooms, and categorised infection prevention and control practices into four domains: hand hygiene, glove use, disinfection of reusable equipment, and waste management. We calculated compliance as the proportion of indications (infection risks) in which a health worker performed a correct action, and examined associations between compliance and health worker and facility characteristics using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models. Findings Between Feb 7 and April 5, 2018, we visited 228 health facilities, and observed at least one infection prevention and control indication in 220 facilities (118 [54%] dispensaries, 66 [30%] health centres, and 36 [16%] hospitals). 18 710 indications were observed across 734 health workers (49 [7%] medical doctors, 214 [29%] assistant medical officers or clinical officers, 106 [14%] nurses or midwives, 126 [17%] clinical assistants, and 238 [32%] laboratory technicians or assistants). Compliance was 6\u00B79% for hand hygiene (n=8655 indications), 74\u00B78% for glove use (n=4915), 4\u00B78% for disinfection of reusable equipment (n=841), and 43\u00B73% for waste management (n=4299). Facility location was not associated with compliance in any of the infection prevention and control domains. Facility level and ownership were also not significantly associated with compliance, except for waste management. For hand hygiene, nurses and midwives (odds ratio 5\u00B780 [95% CI 3\u00B791\u20138\u00B761]) and nursing and medical assistants (2\u00B765 [1\u00B767\u20134\u00B720]) significantly outperformed the reference category of assistant medical officers or clinical officers. For glove use, nurses and midwives (10\u00B706 [6\u00B768\u201315\u00B713]) and nursing and medical assistants (5\u00B793 [4\u00B705\u20138\u00B771]) also significantly outperformed the reference category. Laboratory technicians performed significantly better in glove use (11\u00B795 [8\u00B798\u201315\u00B789]), but significantly worse in hand hygiene (0\u00B727 [0\u00B717\u20130\u00B743]) and waste management (0\u00B725 [0\u00B714\u20130\u00B744] than the reference category. Health worker age was negatively associated with correct glove use and female health workers were more likely to comply with hand hygiene. Interpretation Health worker infection prevention and control compliance, particularly for hand hygiene and disinfection, was inadequate in these outpatient settings. Improvements in provision of supplies and health worker behaviours are urgently needed in the face of the current pandemic.

Anecdotal reports suggest plasma with high antibody titers towards influenza may be of benefit in the treatment of severe influenza. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, open-label, multicenter phase 2 trial at 29 academic medical centers in the United States to assess the safety and efficacy of anti-influenza plasma with hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers of \u2265 1:80 to the infecting strain. Hospitalized children and adults (including pregnant women) with severe influenza A or B (defined as hypoxia or tachypnea) were randomly assigned to receive either 2 units (or pediatric equivalent) of anti-influenza plasma plus standard care (P\u002BS), versus standard care alone (S), and were followed for 28 days. The primary endpoint was time to normalization of patients\u2019 respiratory status (respiratory rate of \u2264 20 for adults or age defined thresholds of 20\u201338 for children), and a room air saturation of oxygen \u2265 93%. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01052480 FINDINGS: Between January 13, 2011 and March 2, 2015, 113 participants were screened, and 98 were randomized. Of the participants with confirmed influenza, 28 of 42 (67%) of P\u002BS participants normalized their respiratory status by Day 28, as compared to 24 of 45 (53%) of S participants (p=0\u00B7069). The estimated hazard ratio comparing P\u002BS to S was 1\u00B771 (95% CI: 0\u00B796 to 3\u00B706). Six participants died, 1 (2%) and 5 (10%) from the P\u002BS and S arms respectively (p=0\u00B7093). P\u002BS participants had non-significant reductions in days in hospital (median 6 vs. 11 days, p=0\u00B713) and days on mechanical ventilation (median 0 vs. 3 days, p=0\u00B714), and significantly improved clinical status at Day 7 (p=0\u00B7020). Fewer P\u002BS participants experienced SAEs compared to S recipients (20% vs. 38%, p= 0\u00B7041), the most frequent of which were acute respiratory distress syndrome (1 [2%] vs 2 [4%]) and stroke (1 [2%] vs 2 [4%]). INTERPRETATION: Results from this Phase II randomized trial of immune plasma for the treatment of severe influenza provides support for a possible benefit of immunotherapy across the primary and secondary endpoints. A Phase III randomized trial is now underway to further evaluate this intervention.","publish_time":"2017-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Beigel, John H.; Tebas, Pablo; Elie-Turenne, Marie-Carmelle; Bajwa, Ednan; Bell, Todd E.; Cairns, Charles B.; Shoham, Shmuel; Deville, Jaime G.; Feucht, Eric; Feinberg, Judith; Luke, Thomas; Raviprakash, Kanakatte; Danko, Janine; O\u2019Neil, Dorothy; Metcalf, Julia A.; King, Karen; Burgess, Timothy H.; Aga, Evgenia; Lane, H.

The pigment appears to be synthesized in the shell gland. The protoporphyrin IX synthetic pathway is well defined, but precisely where and how it is synthesized in the shell gland of the brown-egg laying hen is still ambiguous. The pigment is deposited onto all shell layers including the shell membranes, but most of it is concentrated in the outermost layer of the calcareous shell and in the cuticle. Recently, the genes that are involved in pigment synthesis have been identified, but the genetic control of synthesis and deposition of brown pigment in the commercial laying hen is not fully understood. The brown coloration of the shell is an important shell quality parameter and has a positive influence on consumer preference. The extent of pigment deposition is influenced by the housing system, hen age, hen strain, diet, stressors, and certain diseases such as infectious bronchitis. In this article, the physiological and biochemical characteristics of the brown pigment in commercial brown-egg layers are reviewed in relation to its various functions in the poultry industry.","publish_time":"2015-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Samiullah, S.; Roberts, J.

An important means to unraveling the complexities of disaster management is to recognize the interdependencies between health care and broader social systems and how they intersect to promote health and resilience before, during and after a crisis. While recent literature has expanded our understanding of the complexity of disasters at the macro level, few studies have examined empirically how dynamic elements of critical social infrastructure at the micro level influence community capacity. The purpose of this study was to explore empirically the complexity of disasters, to determine levers for action where interventions can be used to facilitate collaborative action and promote health among high risk populations. A second purpose was to build a framework for critical social infrastructure and develop a model to identify potential points of intervention to promote population health and resilience. A community-based participatory research design was used in nine focus group consultations (n = 143) held in five communities in Canada, between October 2010 and March 2011, using the Structured Interview Matrix facilitation technique. The findings underscore the importance of interconnectedness of hard and soft systems at the micro level, with culture providing the backdrop for the social fabric of each community. Open coding drawing upon the tenets of complexity theory was used to develop four core themes that provide structure for the framework that evolved; they relate to dynamic context, situational awareness and connectedness, flexible planning, and collaboration, which are needed to foster adaptive responses to disasters. Seven action recommendations are presented, to promote community resilience and population health.","publish_time":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Sullivan, Tracey L.; Kuziemsky, Craig E.; Toal-Sullivan, Darene; Corneil, Wayne","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a63b380d7f5b30a32917b4c16ea8743c60d471ff.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115777.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953612005953; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22898721/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953612005953; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.07.040","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Structured Interview"],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["population health","health care","complexity of disasters","community resilience","social fabric","Abstract Complexity","broader social systems","dynamic elements of critical social infrastructure","micro level influence community capacity","macro level","tenets of complexity theory","collaborative action","framework","action recommendations","understanding","purpose","complexities of disaster management","soft systems","dynamic context","situational awareness","model","useful frame of reference","interdependencies","flexible planning","potential points of intervention","importance of interconnectedness","Structured Interview Matrix facilitation technique","focus group consultations","Open coding drawing","participatory research design","studies","high risk populations","backdrop","culture","levers","collaboration","core themes","interventions","important means","findings","recent literature","adaptive responses","study","communities","Canada","crisis"],"language":"en"},

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: This study was conducted at the Woosuk Korean Medicine Medical Center in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty\u2010eight patients with rhinitis participated in this study. All patients received Biyeom\u2010go treatment \u003E3 times daily for a total of 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the total nasal symptom score. Mini\u2010rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire, nasal endoscopy index, total serum immunoglobulin E levels and immunologic factors in nasal lavage fluid were also measured. RESULTS: Biyeom\u2010go administration was associated with significant improvements in total nasal symptoms scores (P \u003C .0001) and mini\u2010rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire scores (P \u003C .0001) in a time\u2010dependent manner. The nasal endoscopy index also significantly improved at weeks 2 (P = .0049), 3 (P \u003C .0001) and 4 (P = .0001) after Biyeom\u2010go treatment.

CoVs encode two large polyproteins, which are then processed into 15\u201316 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that make significant contributions to viral replication and transcription by assembling the RNA replicase complex. Among them, nsp9 plays an essential role in viral replication by forming a homodimer that binds single\u2010stranded RNA. Thus, disrupting nsp9 dimerization is a potential anti\u2010CoV therapy. However, different nsp9 dimer forms have been reported for alpha\u2010 and beta\u2010CoVs, and no structural information is available for gamma\u2010CoVs. Here we determined the crystal structure of nsp9 from the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a representative gamma\u2010CoV that affects the economy of the poultry industry because it can infect domestic fowl. IBV nsp9 forms a homodimer via interactions across a hydrophobic interface, which consists of two parallel alpha helices near the carboxy terminus of the protein. The IBV nsp9 dimer resembles that of SARS\u2010CoV nsp9, indicating that this type of dimerization is conserved among all CoVs. This makes disruption of the dimeric interface an excellent strategy for developing anti\u2010CoV therapies. To facilitate this effort, we characterized the roles of six conserved residues on this interface using site\u2010directed mutagenesis and a multitude of biochemical and biophysical methods. We found that three residues are critical for nsp9 dimerization and its abitlity to bind RNA.","publish_time":"2017-04-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Tingting; Chen, Cheng; Li, Huiyan; Dou, Yanshu; Zhou, Ming; Lu, Deren; Zong, Qi; Li, Yulei; Yang, Cheng; Zhong, Zhihui; Singh, Namit; Hu, Honggang; Zhang, Rundong; Yang, Haitao; Su, Dan","journal":"Protein Science","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/39d57801c57e1abf6a5f5e9e05f9834a1dd7ee90.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5405427.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.3150; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/pro.3150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28257598/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IBV"],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["CoV nsp9","nsp9 dimerization","CoVs","IBV nsp9 dimer","crystal structure of nsp9","different nsp9 dimer forms","anti\u2010CoV therapies","potential anti\u2010CoV therapy","SARS","homodimer","viral replication","dimeric interface","hydrophobic interface","type of dimerization","stranded RNA","conserved residues","RNA replicase complex","severe acute respiratory syndrome","representative gamma","recent emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome","parallel alpha helices","transcription","excellent strategy","avian infectious bronchitis virus","significant contributions","carboxy terminus","site","structural information","interactions","multitude of biochemical","serious concern","nsps","mutagenesis","economy","essential role","abitlity","poultry industry","biophysical methods","disruption","roles","infection","coronaviruses","beta","domestic fowl","nonstructural proteins","human population","large polyproteins","effort"],"language":"en"},

All recovered cases had a unilateral peripheral pattern of involvement limited to only one zone on initial chest CT. It seems that CT imaging has an important role in predicting COVID-19 outcomes for solid organ transplant recipients. Future studies with long-term follow up and more cases are needed to elucidate COVID-19 diagnosis, outcome, and management strategies for these patients.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Abrishami, Alireza; Samavat, Shiva; Behnam, Behdad; Arab-Ahmadi, Mehran; Nafar, Mohsen; Sanei Taheri, Morteza","journal":"Eur Urol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/138a25c18c822aa7d8b9bf456744e04c12f0d46d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200360.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409114/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0302283820303328; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.04.064; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283820303328","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs0OTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["patients","severe COVID","outcomes","predicting COVID","CT imaging","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","imaging findings","imaging features","severe signs","common clinical symptoms","acute respiratory distress syndrome","pattern of lung involvement","Abstract Coronavirus disease","unilateral peripheral pattern of involvement","clinical course","contagious disease","recovered cases","comorbidities","immunosuppressive conditions","pneumonia","important role","ground glass opacity","dyspnea","computed tomography","laboratory data","normal white blood cell count","solid organ transplant recipients","combination of consolidation","long-term follow","diagnosis","management strategies","SARS-CoV","initial chest","case series","Older adults","Future studies","zone","novel","history of kidney transplantation","Fever","cough","death","leukopenia","leukocytosis"],"language":"en"},

The authors aim to provide several examples of digital health solutions utilized to manage orthopaedic patients during the pandemic and discuss what features of these technologies are likely to continue to provide value to patients and clinicians following its resolution. CONCLUSION: The widespread adoption of new technologies enabling providers to care for patients remotely has the potential to permanently change the expectations of all stakeholders about the way care is provided in orthopaedics.

To control the mortality rate associated with the 2019-nCoV, prompt steps are needed. Until now there is no effective treatment or drug present to control its life-threatening effects in the humans. The scientist is struggling to find new inhibitors of this deadly virus. In this study, to identify the effective inhibitor candidates against the main protease (Mpro) of 2019-nCoV, computational approaches were adopted. Phytochemicals having immense medicinal properties as ligands were docked against the Mpro of 2019-nCoV to study their binding properties.

In this preventative randomised trial, xylitol will be tested for the prevention of acute otitis media (AOM), a common and costly condition in young children. The primary outcome will be the incidence of AOM. Secondary outcomes will include upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and dental caries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be a pragmatic, blinded (participant and parents, practitioners and analyst), two-armed superiority, placebo-controlled randomised trial with 1:1 allocation, stratified by clinical site. The trial will be conducted in the 11 primary care group practices participating in the TARGet Kids! research network in Canada. Eligible participants between the ages of 2\u20134 years will be randomly assigned to the intervention arm of regular xylitol syrup use or the control arm of regular sorbitol use for 6 months. We expect to recruit 236 participants, per treatment arm, to detect a 20% relative risk reduction in AOM episodes. AOM will be identified through chart review. The secondary outcomes of URTIs and dental caries will be identified through monthly phone calls with specified questions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval from the Research Ethics Boards at the Hospital for Sick Children and St. Michael\u2019s Hospital has been obtained for this study and also for the TARGet Kids! research network.

To date, no antiviral or vaccine is available for this common viral infection. Immunomodulators could represent an interesting strategy for the treatment of severe viral infection. Recently, the role of protease-activated receptors (PAR) in inflammation, coagulation and infection processes has been of growing interest. Herein, the effects of a PAR1 agonist and a PAR1 antagonist on hMPV infection were investigated in BALB/c mice. Intranasal administration of the PAR1 agonist resulted in increased weight loss and mortality of infected mice. Conversely, the PAR1 antagonist was beneficial to hMPV infection by decreasing weight loss and clinical signs and by significantly reducing pulmonary inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (including IL-6, KC and MCP-1) and recruitment of immune cells to the lungs. In addition, a significant reduction in pulmonary viral titers was also observed in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice. Despite no apparent direct effect on virus replication during in vitro experiments, an important role for PAR1 in the regulation of furin expression in the lungs was shown for the first time. Further experiments indicated that the hMPV fusion protein can be cleaved by furin thus suggesting that PAR1 could have an effect on viral infectivity in addition to its immunomodulatory properties. Thus, inhibition of PAR1 by selected antagonists could represent an interesting strategy for decreasing the severity of paramyxovirus infections.","publish_time":"2013-08-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Aerts, Laetitia; Hamelin, Marie-\u00C8ve; Rh\u00E9aume, Chantal; Lavigne, Sophie; Couture, Christian; Kim, WooJin; Susan-Resiga, Delia; Prat, Annik; Seidah, Nabil G.; Vergnolle, Nathalie; Riteau, Beatrice; Boivin, Guy","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6f251e71a441068ffe96970bf5d857713ec30163.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3755973.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24015257/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0072529","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2MjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hMPV infection","PAR1 agonist","inhibition of PAR1","common viral infection","lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice","infection processes","treatment of severe viral infection","viral infectivity","pulmonary viral titers","pulmonary inflammation","hMPV fusion protein","interesting strategy","experiments","addition","c mice","increased weight loss","mortality of infected mice","important role","role of protease","apparent direct effect","regulation of furin expression","severity of paramyxovirus infections","acute respiratory tract infections","pro-inflammatory cytokine levels","virus replication","vaccine","activated receptors","significant reduction","selected antagonists","clinical signs","coagulation","BALB","immunomodulatory properties","Human metapneumovirus","recruitment of immune cells","hospitalization","MCP","antiviral","Intranasal administration","children","adults","date","KC","Immunomodulators","effects","time"],"language":"en"},

Before the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009, most human influenza A/H1N1 viruses contained the avian-associated residue, serine, at position 216 in PB1. However, near the onset of the 2009 pandemic, human viruses began to acquire the mammalian-associated residue, glycine, at PB1\u2013216, and PB1\u2013216G became predominant in human viruses thereafter. METHODS: Using entropy-based analysis algorithm, we have previously identified several host-specific amino-acid signatures that separated avian and swine viruses from human influenza viruses. The presence of these host-specific signatures in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses suggested that these mutations were the result of adaptive genetic evolution that enabled these influenza viruses to circumvent host barriers, which resulted in cross-species transmission. We investigated the biological impact of this natural avian-to-mammalian signature substitution at PB1\u2013216 in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses. RESULTS: We found that PB1\u2013216G viruses had greater mutation potential, and were more sensitive to ribavirin than PB1\u2013216S viruses. In oseltamivir-treated HEK293 cells, PB1\u2013216G viruses generated mutations in viral neuraminidase at a higher rate than PB1\u2013216S viruses. By contrast, PB1\u2013216S viruses were more virulent in mice than PB1\u2013216G viruses. These results suggest that the PB1-S216G substitution enhances viral epidemiological fitness by increasing the frequency of adaptive mutations in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results thus suggest that the increased adaptability and epidemiological fitness of naturally arising human PB1\u2013216G viruses, which have a canonical low-fidelity replicase, were the biological mechanisms underlying the replacement of PB1\u2013216S viruses with a high-fidelity replicase following the emergence of pdmH1N1. We think that continued surveillance of such naturally occurring PB1\u2013216 variants among others is warranted to assess the potential impact of changes in RdRp fidelity on the adaptability and epidemiological fitness of human A/H1N1 influenza viruses.

The EBOV glycoprotein (GP) mediates viral entry into host cells. For this, GP depends on priming by the pH-dependent endolysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B (CatB) and, to a lesser degree, cathepsin L (CatL), at least in most cell culture systems. However, there is limited information on whether and how EBOV-GP can acquire resistance to CatB/L inhibitors. Here, we addressed this question using replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus bearing EBOV-GP. Five passages of this virus in the presence of the CatB/CatL inhibitor MDL28170 were sufficient to select resistant viral variants and sequencing revealed that all GP sequences contained a V37A mutation, which, in the context of native GP, is located in the base of the GP surface unit. In addition, some GP sequences harbored mutation S195R in the receptor-binding domain. Finally, mutational analysis demonstrated that V37A but not S195R conferred resistance against MDL28170 and other CatB/CatL inhibitors. Collectively, a single amino acid substitution in GP is sufficient to confer resistance against CatB/CatL inhibitors, suggesting that usage of CatB/CatL inhibitors for antiviral therapy may rapidly select for resistant viral variants.","publish_time":"2019-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoffmann, Markus; Kaufmann, Svenja Victoria; Fischer, Carina; Maurer, Wiebke; Moldenhauer, Anna-Sophie; P\u00F6hlmann, Stefan","journal":"Pathogens","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8f8bd6796570957dcf2c62e70faa1f1ca3769182.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6963435.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31618932/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens8040192","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs2NzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EBOV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EBOV-GP","GP sequences","CatL inhibitors","GP surface unit","context of native GP","usage of CatB","resistance","CatL inhibitor MDL28170","EBOV glycoprotein","resistant viral variants","mutation S195R","viral entry","V37A mutation","Ebola virus","replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus","pH-dependent endolysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B","antiviral therapy","infection","presence","sequencing","single amino acid substitution","fatal disease","question","receptor-binding domain","priming","base","human patients","host cells","lesser degree","addition","mutational analysis","cell culture systems","passages","limited information"],"language":"en"},

Etiologic misdiagnosis can alter the trajectory of patient care, including antibiotic overuse. A host-protein signature comprising tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was validated recently for differentiating bacterial from viral disease. However, a focused head-to-head comparison of its diagnostic performance against other biomarker candidates for this indication was lacking in patients with respiratory infection and fever without source. We compared the signature to other biomarkers and prediction rules using specimens collected prospectively at two secondary medical centers from children and adults. Inclusion criteria included fever \u003E 37.5 \u00B0C, symptom duration \u2264 12 days, and presentation with respiratory infection or fever without source. Comparator method was based on expert panel adjudication. Signature and biomarker cutoffs and prediction rules were predefined. Of 493 potentially eligible patients, 314 were assigned unanimous expert panel diagnosis and also had sufficient specimen volume. The resulting cohort comprised 175 (56%) viral and 139 (44%) bacterial infections. Signature sensitivity 93.5% (95% CI 89.1\u201397.9%), specificity 94.3% (95% CI 90.7\u201398.0%), or both were significantly higher (all p values \u003C 0.01) than for CRP, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, human neutrophil lipocalin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and prediction rules. Signature identified as viral 50/57 viral patients prescribed antibiotics, suggesting potential to reduce antibiotic overuse by 88%. The host-protein signature demonstrated superior diagnostic performance in differentiating viral from bacterial respiratory infections and fever without source. Future utility studies are warranted to validate potential to reduce antibiotic overuse.

A wide range of data is collected within healthcare settings; however, the extent to which this information is used to understand HCAI dynamics has not been quantified. Aim To examine the use of spatiotemporal analyses to identify and prevent HCAI transmission in healthcare settings, and to provide recommendations for expanding the use of these techniques. Methods A systematic review of the literature was undertaken, focusing on spatiotemporal examination of infectious diseases in healthcare settings. Abstracts and full-text articles were reviewed independently by two authors to determine inclusion. Findings In total, 146 studies met the inclusion criteria. There was considerable variation in the use of data, with surprisingly few studies (N = 22) using spatiotemporal-specific analyses to extend knowledge of HCAI transmission dynamics. The remaining 124 studies were descriptive. A modest increase in the application of statistical analyses has occurred in recent years. Conclusion The incorporation of spatiotemporal analysis has been limited in healthcare settings, with only 15% of studies including any such analysis. Analytical studies provided greater data on transmission dynamics and effective control interventions than studies without spatiotemporal analyses. This indicates the need for greater integration of spatiotemporal techniques into HCAI investigations, as even simple analyses provide significant improvements in the understanding of prevention over simple descriptive summaries.","publish_time":"2014-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Davis, G.

The emergence of a \u201Cnew\u201D pathogen is not an isolated event, as for instance the frequent appearance of new influenza virus strains demonstrates. Often the new virus strains co-circulate with the older strains in a susceptible population, but a replacement of the older strains has been also observed. In rare instances the new viruses can cause dramatic epidemics or pandemics, such as those observed with the human immunodeficiency virus, canine parvovirus, or most recently, with the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United Kingdom. The mechanisms of the emergence are not always clearly understood, but an altered host range appears to be a common event. Whether a true change in host range occurs, or whether the virus adapted to the host and replicated more efficiently, is often unknown. This review tries to summarize the facts that are known about a wide variety of \u201Cnew\u201D viruses of mammals, such as the simian, human and feline lentiviruses, the feline coronaviruses, the feline parvoviruses, the carnivore morbilliviruses, the influenza A viruses, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.

The review also discusses vitamin D as an emerging risk factor for respiratory infections and wheezing.","publish_time":"2009-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mansbach, Jonathan M.; Camargo, Carlos A.","journal":"Clinics in Laboratory Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/491c2f2a617158045db53c28aba3e943a82b31a7.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dc3aa24220b34359f31a656d466cc4dc7c0995cc.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2810250.xml.json","url":"http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2810250?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272271209000663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19892232/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cll.2009.07.011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272271209000663","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3Mzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severe bronchiolitis","children age","hospitalized children","recurrent wheezing","future wheezing","review","viruses","increased risk of developing childhood asthma","emerging risk factor","leading cause of hospitalization","vitamin D","respiratory infections","year","role","episode","genetic factors","pathway"],"language":"en"},

Viruses evolve at different rates of evolution depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intra-host evolution is generally more rapid that inter-host evolution and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve render very unlikely the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes). Several computational methods are reviewed that permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses. The evolution of virus in the form of dynamic mutant clouds in each infected individual, together with multiple environmental influences, render the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens an unpredictable event, another example of biological complexity.","publish_time":"2016-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Domingo, Esteban","journal":"Virus as Populations","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3f54a73bbb6fc8e974a1dd3fb30dde2fe8633801.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149407.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128008379000071; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128008379000071","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolution of virus","inter-host evolution","intra-host evolution","Calculated rates of evolution","different rates of evolution","virus persistence","virus isolations","Abstract Viruses","nature","error-prone viruses","render","host population numbers","possible mechanisms","reemergence of viral pathogens","alignment of viral sequences","infected individual","unpredictable event","constant rate of incorporation","molecular clock","operation","form of dynamic mutant clouds","mutations","multiple environmental influences","establishment of phylogenetic relationships","polymerase","extinction","key parameters","pandemics","example of biological complexity","rise","epidemics","fidelity","time interval","genome replication","evolving genomes","difference"],"language":"en"},

Moreover, 62% knew that no vaccine can prevent the disease. However, only 36% realized that taking antibiotics will not stop the infection, and only 41% recognized that no medication has yet been manufactured to treat it. Regarding protection measures, 74% used hand sanitizers, 43% avoided crowded places, and 11% wore masks in public places. Moreover, only 47% knew that bats and camels are the primary source of the virus. As anticipated, this level of awareness varied between the different categories of the studied population. Female, married, older, and more educated participants were significantly more knowledgeable about the disease. Public awareness of MERS is generally sufficient.

Here we have determined the 5\u2032 UTR and adjacent 289-nt sequences, and 3\u2032 UTR sequences, for six group 2 coronaviruses and have compared them to each other and to three previously reported group 2 members. Extensive regions of highly similar UTR sequences were found but small regions of divergence were also found indicating group 2 coronaviruses could be subdivided into those that are bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-like (BCoV, human respiratory coronavirus-OC43, human enteric coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, and equine coronavirus) and those that are murine hepatitis virus (MHV)-like (A59, 2, and JHM strains of MHV, puffinosis virus, and rat sialodacryoadenitis virus). The 3\u2032 UTRs of BCoV and MHV have been previously shown to be interchangeable. Here, a reporter-containing BCoV DI RNA was shown to be replicated by all five BCoV-like helper viruses and by MHV-H2 (a human cell-adapted MHV strain), a representative of the MHV-like subgroup, demonstrating group 2 common 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 replication signaling elements. BCoV DI RNA, furthermore, acquired the leader of HCoV-OC43 by leader switching, demonstrating for the first time in vivo recombination between animal and human coronavirus molecules.

The infant was a 9.5-month-old girl with fever, pancytopenia and hepatosplenomegaly, which meet the HLH-2004 standard, and the negative gene results exclude congenital HLH. However, chemotherapy is ineffective and is accompanied by severe infection. Fortunately, she is diagnosed with VL-HLH (visceral leishmaniasis-related hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis), as leishmania is detected by next-generation meta-genome sequencing (mNGS) and quickly relieved after treatment with libosomal amphotericin B (L-AMB).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 116 hemodialysis (HD) patients in contact with MERS-CoV-confirmed subjects were isolated using three strategies, namely, single room isolation, cohort isolation, and self-quarantine. We used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised-Korean (IES-R-K) to examine post-traumatic stress symptoms at 12 months after the isolation period. RESULTS: Of the 116 HD patients, 27 were lost to follow-up. Of the 89 patients, 67 (75.3%) completed the questionnaires. Single room isolation was used on 40 (58.8%) of the patients, cohort isolation on 20 (29.4%), and self-imposed quarantine on 8 (11.8%). In total, 17.9% of participants (n = 12) reported post-traumatic stress symptoms exceeding the IES-R-K\u2019s cutoff point (\u226718). Prevalence rates of IES-R-K \u226718 did not differ significantly according to isolation method. However, isolation duration was linearly associated with the IES-R-K score (standardized \u03B2 coefficient \u2212 0.272, P = 0.026). Scores in Avoidance, Emotional numbing and Dissociation subscale were higher in patients with longer isolation period. CONCLUSION: MERS was a traumatic experience for quarantined HD patients. IES-R-K scores were not significantly different by isolation methods. However, short isolation was associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cho, A Jin; Lee, Hong-Seock; Lee, Young-Ki; Jeon, Hee Jung; Park, Hayne Cho; Jeong, Da-Wun; Kim, Yang-Gyun; Lee, Sang-Ho; Lee, Chang-Hee; Yoo, Kyung Don; Wong, Ae Kyeong","journal":"Biopsychosoc Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fa3ead39adfb6028f3586e0f4bf109c94357e20.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156895.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13030-020-00181-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32308734/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs3ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East","South Korea"],"keyphrases":["cohort isolation","isolation methods","dialysis patients","short isolation","isolation duration","Post-traumatic stress symptoms","IES-R","quarantined HD patients","single room isolation","longer isolation period","traumatic experience","confirmed MERS-CoV infection","Prevalence rates of IES","Scores","total","medical staff","medical illness","self-quarantine","self-imposed quarantine","Dissociation subscale","Emotional numbing","outbreak","risk factors","months","Avoidance","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","South Korea","hemodialysis","contact","standardized \u03B2 coefficient","Korean","K\u2019s cutoff point","strategies","BACKGROUND","Impact of Event Scale","subjects","CONCLUSION","centers","participants","MATERIALS","spread","RESULTS","follow-up","questionnaires"],"language":"en"},

This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher\u0027s exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, \u03C7(2) = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]\u00B0C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, \u03C7(2) = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 \u00B1 6.60 vs. 41.27 \u00B1 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (\u03C7(2) = 16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628\u201344.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577\u201325.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036\u201378.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942\u201340.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098\u201350.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224\u221234.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature at admission, respiratory failure, albumin, C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.","publish_time":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Wei; Tao, Zhao-Wu; Wang, Lei; Yuan, Ming-Li; Liu, Kui; Zhou, Ling; Wei, Shuang; Deng, Yan; Liu, Jing; Liu, Hui-Guo; Ming, Yang; Yi, Hu","journal":"Chin Med J (Engl)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1c3f83f83bc725064f9d634d10facb8ec2254bec.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7147279.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32118640/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000000775","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Associated"],"locations":["Wuhan","China"],"keyphrases":["progression group","stabilization group","progression of COVID","progression of pneumonia","disease progression","disease improvement","higher proportion of patients","respiratory failure","induced pneumonia","pneumonia epidemic","C-reactive protein","maximum body temperature","admission","history of smoking","Mann-Whitney U test","respiratory rate","Albumin","risk factors","study","Associated results","high-level respiratory support","clinical typing results","Chi-squared test","Fisher\u0027s exact test","clinical data","Wuhan","statistical analysis","novel coronavirus disease","Multivariate logistic analysis","Logistic regression analysis","independent samples t-test","Individual data","Continuous variables","Categorical variables","imaging characteristics","laboratory indices","common initial symptom","Hubei province of China","optimal treatment regimens","weeks","hospitalization","fever","odds ratio","inclusion criteria","nucleic acid detection","Efficacy evaluation","tertiary hospitals","ability of management","prognosis","confidence interval","METHODS","years","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","breaths"],"language":"en"},

To characterize protein sequences numerically, three groups of features were extracted and related to statistical, dynamics measurements and fluctuation complexity of the sequences. With the obtained feature vector, two models utilizing Gaussian Kernel similarity and Cosine similarity were built to measure the similarity between sequences. We applied our method to analyze the similarities/dissimilarities of four data sets. Both proposed models received consistent results with improvements when compared to that obtained by the ClustalW analysis.

The drastic enhancement of fluorescence intensity of berberine was attributed to the formation of an inclusion complex between HDB-\u03B2-CD and berberine, which has been utilized as the basis of the fabrication of a berberine-sensitive fluorescence sensor. The proposed sensor was quite distinct from those fluorescent sensors for berberine reported so far which relied upon quenching the fluorescence of the sensing reagent immobilized on membrane by berberine. The response mechanism of optode membrane was discussed in detail from the view of molecular dynamics and the optimum steric configuration of the inclusion complex was presented by molecular dynamics simulation. The analytical performance characteristics of the proposed berberine-sensitive sensor were investigated. The sensor can be applied to the quantification of berberine with a linear range covering from 4.0\u00D710\u22127 to 2.0\u00D710\u22125 moll\u22121 with a detection limit of 8.0\u00D710\u22128 moll\u22121.

We determined the impact of real\u2010time PCR, additional to DIF, on antibiotic prescription in ventilated children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) at admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: First, a multicenter survey study was performed. Subsequently, in a prospective study, children (\u22645 years) with LRTI were tested at admission by DIF and PCR. Positive DIF results were reported at the end of the first working day. PICU physicians reported antibiotic treatment on the second working day. After informing them of the PCR result antibiotic treatment was reevaluated. RESULTS: The multicenter survey study (94 respondents) showed that PCR decreased antibiotic use (P \u003C 0.001). In the prospective study 38 children were included, of which 19 (50%) were DIF positive. Of the 19 DIF negative patients 12 (63%) were treated with antibiotics before revealing the PCR result; the PCR test was positive in 9 out of 12.

In order to treat patients at an early stage and prevent the diffusion of an outbreak, early diagnosis, and therefore fast and adequate detection, is needed. To this end, a multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction TaqMan method was designed to detect Zika (ZIKV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses simultaneously. Methods Two methods targeting different genome segments were selected from the literature for each virus. These were adapted for high genome coverage and combined in a four-plex assay that was thoroughly validated in-house. The SCREENED tool was used to evaluate the sequence coverage of the method. Results The full validation approach showed that the new four-plex method allows the specific and sensitive identification and discrimination of ZIKV and CHIKV in routine samples. The combination of two targets per virus allowing almost 100% coverage of about 500 genomes is shown for the first time. Conclusions PCR is a reliable user-friendly technique that can be applied in remote areas. Such multiplex methods enable early and efficient diagnosis, leading to rapid treatment and effective confinement in outbreak cases. They may also serve as an aid for surveillance, and the full validation permits easy method-transfer allowing worldwide harmonization.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Broeders, Sylvia; Garlant, Linda; Fraiture, Marie-Alice; Vandermassen, Els; Suin, Vanessa; Vanhomwegen, Jessica; Dupont-Rouzeyrol, Myrielle; Rousset, Dominique; Van Gucht, Steven; Roosens, Nancy","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/05ea31d971a2dfb0fc8e6f9ab2e0fdcad1239712.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129992.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31884173/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971219305016; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2019.12.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219305016","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzUzLmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1671684,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"rGa76DrWyRWSYGWxMqguVQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_53.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ZIKV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early diagnosis","multiplex methods","easy method-transfer","CHIKV","early stage","new areas","high genome coverage","sequence coverage","efficient diagnosis","discrimination of ZIKV","outbreak cases","multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction TaqMan method","tropical viruses","remote areas","plex assay","worldwide harmonization","validation approach","different genome segments","rapid treatment","sensitive identification","effective confinement","diffusion","reliable user-friendly technique","Conclusions PCR","re-emergence","Zika","chikungunya","routine samples","patients","literature","Abstract Objective","adequate detection","wave of concern","surveillance","combination","targets","genomes","order","SCREENED tool","aid"],"language":"en"},

In order to be curative, it is imperative that CSCs must be eliminated by cancer therapy. A variety of dietary phytochemicals and repositioned drugs can act synergistically with conventional anti-cancer agents. In this review, we advocate the development of a novel approach, namely combination therapy by incorporating both phytochemicals and repositioned drugs to target CSCs. We cover select dietary phytochemicals (curcumin, resveratrol, EGCG, genistein) and repurposed drugs (metformin, niclosamide, thioridazine, chloroquine).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled adult patients presenting with influenzalike illness to the Emergency Department at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, from January 28, 2011, through April 30, 2011. Patients self-collected a midturbinate nasal flocked swab from their right nostril following written instructions. A second swab was then collected by an HCW from the left nostril. Swabs were tested for influenza A and B viruses by real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction, and percent concordance between collection methods was determined. RESULTS: Of the 72 paired specimens analyzed, 25 were positive for influenza A or B RNA by at least one of the collection methods (34.7% positivity rate). When the 14 patients who had prior health care training were excluded, the qualitative agreement between collection methods was 94.8% (55 of 58). Two of the 58 specimens (3.4%) from patients without health care training were positive only by HCW collection, and 1 of 58 (1.7%) was positive only by patient self-collection. A total of 53.4% of patients (31 of 58) preferred the self-collection method over the HCW collection, and 25.9% (15 of 58) had no preference.

A wide variety of viruses play a role in the development of cough after acute infection and all of these manifest a similar clinical picture across different age groups. Despite the large disease burden surprisingly little is known about the mechanism of acute cough following viral infection. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that increased production of neuropeptides and leukotrienes mediate cough after viral infection, along with altered expression of neural receptors. Increased airway mucus production is also likely to play a significant role. This work is reviewed in this article. Following the recent development of a mouse model for rhinovirus infection and the establishment of experimental models of rhinovirus challenge in human subjects with both asthma and COPD the field is expanding to translate in vitro research into clinical studies and hopefully eventually into clinical practice. Developing a clearer understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus induced cough may lead to more specific and effective therapies.","publish_time":"2009-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Footitt, Joseph; Johnston, Sebastian L.","journal":"Pulmonary Pharmacology \u0026 Therapeutics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/151a04d55fe00b5c47927d142d442ebbb45ba7e5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110775.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094553909000248; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094553909000248","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs5OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral infection","acute infection","rhinovirus infection","development of cough","Abstract Acute cough","mechanism of acute cough","virus induced cough","major symptom of viral respiratory tract infection","clinical studies","clinical practice","similar clinical picture","increased production of neuropeptides","human subjects","human populations","Increased airway mucus production","recent development","significant role","establishment of experimental models of rhinovirus challenge","excessive morbidity","manifest","leukotrienes","mouse model","different age groups","asthma","mechanisms","COPD","altered expression of neural receptors","clearer understanding","wide variety of viruses","field","world","research","experiments","large disease burden","effective therapies","work","article"],"language":"en"},

The first is a 59-year-old female with HT in 2012 who presented on March 20, 2020 with fever, hypoxia and ground-glass opacities on chest x-ray. She quickly progressed to acute hypoxic respiratory failure and vasoplegic shock. Despite reduction in immunosuppression, and treatment with tocilizumab, intravenous immunoglobulin, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and broad-spectrum antibiotics, she ultimately passed away from multiorgan failure. The second case is a 75-year-old man with HT in 2000 who presented on April 2, 2020 after curbside testing revealed positive COVID-19. Given a milder presentation compared to the first patient, antimetabolite was discontinued and only hydroxychloroquine was started. Due to lack of clinical improvement several days later, tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and therapeutic anticoagulation were initiated. The patient clinically improved with decreasing oxygen requirements and was discharged home.

They are highly diversified and are the group of mammals with the second largest number of species. Such highly diversified cell types and receptors facilitate them to be potential hosts of a large variety of viruses. Bats are the only group of mammals capable of sustained flight, which enables them to disseminate the viruses they harbor and enhance the chance of interspecies transmission. This article aims at reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses (CoVs). Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of \u003E30 CoVs with complete genomes sequenced, and many more if those without genome sequences are included. Among the four CoV genera, only alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been found in bats. As a whole, both alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been detected from bats in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia; but alphaCoVs seem to be more widespread than betaCoVs, and their detection rate is also higher. For betaCoVs, only those from subgenera Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Hibecovirus have been detected in bats. Most notably, horseshoe bats are the reservoir of SARS-CoV, and several betaCoVs from subgenus Merbecovirus are closely related to MERS-CoV. In addition to the interactions among various bat species themselves, bat\u2013animal and bat\u2013human interactions, such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets and restaurants in Southern China, are important for interspecies transmission of CoVs and may lead to devastating global outbreaks.","publish_time":"2019-02-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wong, Antonio C.

Among \u003E10 million annual admissions to U.S. jails, approximately 55% of detainees are released back into their communities each week (4); in addition, staff members at correctional and detention facilities are members of their local communities. Thus, high rates of COVID-19 in correctional and detention facilities also have the potential to influence broader community transmission. In March 2020, the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) began implementing surveillance for COVID-19 among correctional and detention facilities in Louisiana and identified cases and outbreaks in many facilities. In response, LDH and CDC developed and deployed the COVID-19 Management Assessment and Response (CMAR) tool to guide technical assistance focused on infection prevention and control policies and case management with correctional and detention facilities. This report describes COVID-19 prevalence in correctional and detention facilities detected through surveillance and findings of the CMAR assessment. During March 25-April 22, 489 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 37 (7.6%) hospitalizations and 10 (2.0%) deaths among incarcerated or detained persons, and 253 cases, including 19 (7.5%) hospitalizations and four (1.6%) deaths among staff members were reported. During April 8-22, CMAR telephone-based assessments were conducted with 13 of 31 (42%) facilities with laboratory-confirmed cases and 11 of 113 (10%) facilities without known cases.

OBJECTIVES: To query the international spinal cord medicine community\u2019s engagement with and response to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and to assess pandemic-specific information needs and patient concerns. SETTING: An international collaboration of authors and participants. METHODS: Two near-identical surveys (one English and one Spanish language) were distributed via the internet. Responses from those questions shared between the surveys were pooled then analyzed; four questions\u2019 responses (those not shared) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: A total of 783 responses were submitted from six continents. Few participants (5.8%) had tested their outpatients with SCI/D for COVID-19; only 4.4% reported having a patient with SCI/D with the virus. Of respondents who worked at an inpatient facility, 53.3% reported that only individuals with symptoms were being screened and 29.9% said that no screening was occurring. Participants relayed several concerns offered by their patients with SCI/D, including vulnerability to infection (76.9%) and fragility of caretaker supply (42%), and those living in countries with guaranteed health care were more likely to report widespread availability of COVID-19 testing than were those living in countries without universal care, \u03C7(2) (3, N = 625) = 46.259, p \u003C 0.001. CONCLUSION: There is substantial variability in the rehabilitation medicine community in COVID-19 screening practices and availability of screening kits. People living with SCI/D are expressing legitimate and real concerns about their vulnerability to COVID-19. More and rapid work is needed to address these concerns and to standardize best-practice protocols throughout the rehabilitation community.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stillman, Michael D.; Capron, Maclain; Alexander, Marcalee; Di Giusto, Melina Longoni; Scivoletto, Giorgio","journal":"Spinal Cord Ser Cases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7bfc2d19bc86f0859889fbc653b688f65789529c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7156806.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41394-020-0275-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32296046/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCI","COVID"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SCI","patient concerns","participants","widespread availability of COVID","real concerns","rehabilitation medicine community","rehabilitation community","screening practices","availability of screening kits","countries","vulnerability","questions\u2019 responses","universal care","identical surveys","international spinal cord medicine community\u2019s engagement","international collaboration of authors","guaranteed health care","pandemic-specific information needs","substantial variability","English","novel coronavirus","testing","practice protocols","STUDY DESIGN","online survey","Spanish language","SETTING","infection","outpatients","fragility of caretaker supply","respondents","inpatient facility","CONCLUSION","METHODS","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS","total","People","rapid work","individuals","symptoms","internet","continents"],"language":"en"},

In addition, hundreds of more viruses are described without any information on zoonotic potential. We discuss important characteristics of bats including bat biology, evolution, distribution and ecology that not only make them unique among most mammals but also contribute to their potential as viral reservoirs. The detection of a virus in bats does not imply that spillover will occur and several biological, ecological and anthropogenic factors play a role in such an event. We summarize and critically analyse the current knowledge on African bats as reservoirs for corona-, filo-, paramyxo- and lyssaviruses. We highlight that important information on epidemiology, bat biology and ecology is often not available to make informed decisions on zoonotic spillover potential. Even if knowledge gaps exist, it is still important to recognize the role of bats in zoonotic disease outbreaks and implement mitigation strategies to prevent exposure to infectious agents including working safely with bats. Equally important is the crucial role of bats in various ecosystem services. This necessitates a multidisciplinary One Health approach to close knowledge gaps and ensure the development of responsible mitigation strategies to not only minimize risk of infection but also ensure conservation of the species.","publish_time":"2020-02-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Markotter, W; Coertse, J; De Vries, L; Geldenhuys, M; Mortlock, M","journal":"Journal of zoology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427175/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12769","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMjg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["important characteristics of bats","African bats","crucial role of bats","zoonotic potential","important information","zoonotic spillover potential","bat biology","zoonotic disease outbreaks","close knowledge gaps","ecology","current knowledge","large outbreaks","development of responsible mitigation strategies","viral reservoirs","Health approach","corona","informed decisions","evolution","epidemiology","various ecosystem services","infectious agents","filo","past","decades","zoonoses","anthropogenic factors","exposure","distribution","conservation","paramyxo","risk of infection","sporadic spillovers","addition","hundreds","lyssaviruses","mammals","detection","species","event"],"language":"en"},

Four human CoVs (HCoVs), the non-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like HCoVs (namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), are globally endemic and account for a substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections. Non-SARS-like CoV can occasionally produce severe diseases in frail subjects but do not cause any major (fatal) epidemics. In contrast, SARS like CoVs (namely SARS-CoV and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) can cause intense short-lived fatal outbreaks. The current epidemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread globally is of major concern. There is scanty knowledge on the actual pandemic potential of this new SARS-like virus. It might be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is grossly underdiagnosed and that the infection is silently spreading across the globe with two consequences: (i) clusters of severe infections among frail subjects could haphazardly occur linked to unrecognized index cases; (ii) the current epidemic could naturally fall into a low-level endemic phase when a significant number of subjects will have developed immunity. Understanding the role of paucisymptomatic subjects and stratifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality. Whilst the future evolution of this epidemic remains unpredictable, classic public health strategies must follow rational patterns. The emergence of yet another global epidemic underscores the permanent challenges that infectious diseases pose and underscores the need for global cooperation and preparedness, even during inter-epidemic periods.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raoult, Didier; Zumla, Alimuddin; Locatelli, Franco; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Kroemer, Guido","journal":"Cell Stress","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7146059.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.15698/cst2020.04.216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32292881/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsxMzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Middle-East"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Non-SARS","contagious SARS-CoV","new SARS","global epidemic","current epidemic","MERS-CoV","severe diseases","frail subjects","inter-epidemic periods","non-severe acute respiratory syndrome","clusters of severe infections","significant number of subjects","severe clinical presentations","HCoVs","role of paucisymptomatic subjects","human CoVs","Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections","infectious diseases","global cooperation","major concern","low-level endemic phase","intense short-lived fatal outbreaks","classic public health strategies","actual pandemic potential","preparedness","large family of enveloped","stratifying patients","risk","need","permanent challenges","positive-strand RNA viruses","rational patterns","reasonable measures","NL63","OC43","scanty knowledge","account","rapid spread","developed immunity","HKU1","future evolution","unrecognized index cases","consequences","globe","Coronaviruses","epidemics","emergence","contrast","mortality"],"language":"en"},

To help elucidate these roles, we have characterized the first virally encoded cyclophilin (mimicyp) derived from the largest virus discovered to date (the Mimivirus) that is also a causative agent of pneumonia in humans. Mimicyp adopts a typical cyclophilin-fold, yet it also forms trimers unlike any previously characterized homologue. Strikingly, immunofluorescence assays reveal that mimicyp localizes to the surface of the mature virion, as recently proposed for several viruses that recruit host cell cyclophilins such as SARS and HIV-1. Additionally mimicyp lacks peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity in contrast to human cyclophilins. Thus, this study suggests that cyclophilins, whether recruited from host cells (i.e. HIV-1 and SARS) or virally encoded (i.e. Mimivirus), are localized on viral surfaces for at least a subset of viruses.","publish_time":"2008-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thai, Vu; Renesto, Patricia; Fowler, C.

CLEC4M was previously reported to capture artificial HCVpp (pseudoparticle) and transmit it to hepatocytes (transinfection) via CLEC4M-positive cells. It is still not known whether CLEC4M acts as a receptor for HCVcc (cell-culture-produced HCV) transinfection or whether CLEC4M is an entry receptor for HCVcc. Initially, we established stably CLEC4M-positive and HCV-replication-permissive cell lines by introducing a CLEC4M expression vector into Huh7-25 cells (Huh7-25-CLEC4M) by transfection. Huh7-25 is a mutant cell line that is resistant to JFH-1 HCVcc due to the lack of expression of CD81 but permissive for replication of JFH1 HCV RNA. When Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells were infected with HCVcc and cultured for 6 days, none were positive for infection. Next, to examine whether CLEC4M functions as a receptor for transinfection, Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells were inoculated with HCVcc and thereafter co-cultured with Huh7-it cells, which are susceptible to HCV infection. The amount of HCV RNA was increased in Huh7-it cells co-cultured with Huh7-25-CLEC4M cells, and the transinfection was inhibited in the presence of anti-CLEC4M antibody during inoculation. Thus, CLEC4M cannot substitute for CD81 as an entry receptor for JFH-1 HCVcc. It just mediates transinfection without internalization of HCVcc. CD81 is still crucial for HCV entry into hepatocytes, and CLEC4M in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells may be responsible for hepatotropism of HCV infection by trapping circulating HCV to transmit it to adjacent hepatocytes.

Our aim was to determine the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at exon 7 splice acceptor site (SAS) of the OAS1 gene in relation to the interferon response and status of HCV infection. Methods: A 203 bp fragment containing exon 7 SAS was amplified in 70 HCV chronic patients and 50 healthy controls. SNP was examined using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping method. Correlations of SNP genotypes with response to interferon and clinical status of patients were statistically analyzed. Results: There was an increasing trend of response from AA to AG to GG genotypes (P = 0.007). Genotype AA was associated with non\u2010response to interferon and higher degree of liver fibrosis (P = 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed this SNP as independent and a significant determinant of the outcome of interferon therapy (odds ratio 4.913 [95% confidence interval 1.365\u20138.2], P = 0.006). Conclusions: This is the first study to show a significant association between the functional SNP at exon 7 SAS of OAS1 gene and the viral response to interferon in chronic HCV patients. Patients with AA genotype were associated with progressive HCV disease and viral resistance to interferon therapy. This OAS SNP is a potential bio\u2010marker to predict IFN response in chronic hepatitis C patients.","publish_time":"2011-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"El Awady, Mostafa K; Anany, Mohamed A; Esmat, Gamal; Zayed, Naglaa; Tabll, Ashraf A; Helmy, Amr; El Zayady, Abdel Rahman; Abdalla, Mohga S; Sharada, Hayat M; El Raziky, Maissa; El Akel, Wafaa; Abdalla, Shadia; Bader El Din, Noha G","journal":"J Gastroenterol Hepatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/329d7b15985e54ca9d820e0d28b7eb18640075d7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166793.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1746.2010.06605.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21182542/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyNDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SNP","AG","Genotype AA","SAS","OAS SNP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["interferon response","viral response","HCV chronic patients","chronic HCV patients","IFN response","non\u2010response","outcome of interferon therapy","functional SNP","OAS SNP","infected patients","increasing trend of response","progressive HCV disease","clinical status of patients","chronic hepatitis C patients","clinical course of HCV disease","exon","status of HCV infection","Correlations of SNP genotypes","SAS of OAS1 gene","Genotype AA","AA genotype","disease progression","Aim","hepatitis C virus","viral resistance","restriction fragment length polymorphism","significant determinant","bp fragment","significant association","GG genotypes","frequency of single nucleotide polymorphism","innate immune system","RFLP","higher degree of liver fibrosis","marker","potential bio","odds ratio","proven antiviral function","important component","splice acceptor site","genotyping method","possibility","individuals","contribution of host genetic factors","healthy controls","relationship","confidence interval","study","Multivariate analysis","Background","Results","Methods","oligoadenylate synthetase","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Factors contributing to increased distress in HCWs working in high-risk areas treating patients with SARS have not been fully elucidated. The goal of this study was to quantify the psychological effects of working in a high-risk unit during the SARS outbreak. Methods HCWs in a Toronto hospital who worked in high-risk areas completed a questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the SARS crisis along with the Impact of Event Scale\u2014Revised, which screens for PTSS. The comparison group consisted of clinical units that had no contact with patients infected with SARS. Results Factors that were identified to cause distress in the 248 respondent HCWs were the following: (a) perception of risk to themselves, (b) impact of the SARS crisis on their work life, (c) depressive affect, and (d) working in a high-risk unit. In addition, HCWs who cared for only one SARS patient in comparison to those caring for multiple SARS patients experienced more PTSS. Conclusions As expected, HCWs who were working in high-risk units experienced greater distress. Contrary to expectations, HCWs who experienced greater contact with SARS patients while working in the high-risk units were less distressed. This suggests that HCW experience in treating patients infected with SARS may be a mediating factor that could be amenable to intervention in future outbreaks.","publish_time":"2008-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Styra, Rima; Hawryluck, Laura; Robinson, Susan; Kasapinovic, Sonja; Fones, Calvin; Gold, Wayne L.","journal":"Journal of Psychosomatic Research","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4696f5b67a3c721e099958094a85220c09095b69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094601.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.07.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399907003091; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022399907003091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18222131/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyNjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","PTSS"],"locations":["Toronto"],"keyphrases":["SARS crisis","SARS outbreak","multiple SARS patients","high-risk units","Methods HCWs","respondent HCWs","high-risk areas","increased distress","psychological distress","greater distress","PTSS","greater contact","clinical units","psychological effects","comparison group","Results Factors","Impact of Event Scale","increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology","number of publications","severe acute respiratory syndrome","work life","health care workers","Toronto hospital","depressive affect","intervention","expectations","attitude","questionnaire","mediating factor","future outbreaks","Abstract Background","study","screens","following","HCW experience","perception of risk","goal","addition","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Many of those who eventually died, did so in the critical (intensive) care units of various hospitals around the world, and many secondary cases of SARS arose in healthcare workers looking after such patients in these units. Research on SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) demonstrated that this virus belongs to the same family of viruses, the Coronaviridae that causes the common cold, with some important differences. Properties of this virus have been discovered which can be used to develop important infection control policies within hospitals to limit the number of secondary cases. These properties include environmental survival, transmissibility, viral load in various organs and fluids and periods of symptomatic illness during which infectivity is greatest. Various barrier methods were used throughout the epidemic to protect healthcare workers from SARS, with varying degrees of success. Treatment of SARS patients has mainly involved steroid therapy, with or without ribavirin, but there is no consensus on the best treatment protocol, as yet. This review focuses on the implications of SARS for healthcare workers and patients on critical care units.","publish_time":"2004-08-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tang, J.

Experiences in the field can best guide us as to what has been effective. Circumstances in North America in the period of 1999\u20132004 resulted in numerous PRRS virus (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome) negative boar studs becoming infected and disseminating virus to sow farms. Earlier detection methods were needed, and withholding of semen pending negative test results became standard. To accomplish this, diagnostic labs complied with industry requests for same day testing. At the same time, research efforts helped clarify the major routes of PRRS virus introduction into the farms. The risk of fomites and aerosol spread became viewed as major risks. Addressing issues with people and supply entry alone did not eliminate new virus entry. The implementation of air filtration during 2005\u20132008 had a major impact on the rate of new virus introductions into boar studs after other measures alone were unsuccessful. Risks exposed with the introduction of PED virus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea) into North America further highlighted other risk factors such as feed ingredients, trailer sanitation, and the presence of clear physical barriers. The successful adaptation of testing procedures, combined with biosecurity procedures including air filtration, has made the incidence of infectious disease introduction extremely rare in North American boar studs over the last decade. While survivability of infectious disease agents can vary in different materials or in the air, successful protocols should be applied and adjusted as needed to accommodate new information or risks. Cleary defined physical barriers for people and animal entry and exit, sanitization and/or down time on incoming supplies, risk mitigation and testing of feed ingredients, and filtration have been keys to changing the incidence of emerging infectious disease introduction into boar studs.","publish_time":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Reicks, Darwin L.","journal":"Theriogenology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0d578824fe7a24ea08124982a21a7fa9f7011f5f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103121.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0093691X19301803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285050/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.05.041; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X19301803","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjsyNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Cleary"],"organizations":["Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea"],"locations":["North America"],"keyphrases":["incidence of infectious disease introduction","negative boar studs","new virus entry","incidence of emerging infectious disease introduction","introduction of PED virus","North American boar studs","survivability of infectious disease agents","major routes of PRRS virus introduction","Abstract Protecting boar studs","numerous PRRS virus","major risks","rate of new virus introductions","testing of feed ingredients","implementation of air filtration","risk mitigation","biosecurity procedures","risk factors","animal entry","day testing","people","risk of fomites","successful adaptation of testing procedures","supply entry","effective biosecurity measures","major impact","new information","time","farms","semen distribution","presence of clear physical barriers","successful protocols","Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea","negative test results","Respiratory Syndrome","clients","industry requests","trailer sanitation","incoming supplies","aerosol","different materials","early identification","research efforts","sanitization","exit","keys","diagnostic labs","issues","Circumstances","period","Cleary","decade","Earlier detection methods","Experiences","field"],"language":"en"},

The envelope spike glycoprotein on the surface of MERS-CoV mediates receptor binding, membrane fusion, and viral entry. We previously reported two human monoclonal antibodies that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike and exhibit strong neutralization activity against live and pesudotyped MERS-CoV infection. Here we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD bound to the Fab fragment of MERS-27 antibody at 3.20 \u00C5 resolution. The MERS-27 epitope in the RBD overlaps with the binding site of the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4. Further biochemical, viral entry, and neutralization analyses identified two critical residues in the RBD for both MERS-27 recognition and DPP4 binding. One of the residues, Trp535, was found to function as an anchor residue at the binding interface with MERS-27. Upon receptor binding, Trp535 interacts with the N-linked carbohydrate moiety of DPP4. Thus, MERS-27 inhibits MERS-CoV infection by directly blocking both protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4. These results shed light on the molecular basis of MERS-27 neutralization and will assist in the optimization of MERS-27 as a tool to combat MERS-CoV infection.","publish_time":"2015-08-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Xiaojuan; Zhang, Senyan; Jiang, Liwei; Cui, Ye; Li, Dongxia; Wang, Dongli; Wang, Nianshuang; Fu, Lili; Shi, Xuanlin; Li, Ziqiang; Zhang, Linqi; Wang, Xinquan","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/023af2216525c16fa52a75b99cc91ebb03e93107.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4539535.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26281793/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep13133","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszNzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Middle East"],"keyphrases":["MERS-CoV RBD","surface of MERS","optimization of MERS","MERS-CoV receptor DPP4","pesudotyped MERS-CoV infection","molecular basis of MERS","Fab fragment of MERS","crystal structure of MERS","DPP4 binding","receptor binding domain","binding site","binding interface","RBD overlaps","protein-protein","neutralization analyses","protein-carbohydrate interactions","viral entry","Trp535","N-linked carbohydrate moiety of DPP4","strong neutralization activity","critical residues","severe respiratory illness","envelope spike glycoprotein","Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","membrane fusion","antibody","humans","light","human monoclonal antibodies","recognition","tool","anchor residue","results","epitope","\u00C5 resolution","mortality rate"],"language":"en"},

The present study first screened that the DEAD-box RNA helicase 5 (DDX5) was a cellular protein interacting with the Nsp9 of PRRSV by a yeast two-hybrid method in a pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) cDNA library. Next, DDX5 was shown to interact with viral Nsp9 in the co-transfected HEK293 cells with the DDX5- and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, and the interaction between endogenous DDX5 and Nsp9 was also confirmed in MARC-145 cells infected with the Nsp9-expressing lentiviruses. Then, the interacting domains between DDX5 and Nsp9 were determined to be the DEXDc and HELICc domains in DDX5 and the RdRp domain in Nsp9, respectively. Moreover, in the HEK293 cells, MARC-145 cells and PAM cell lines co-transfected with the DDX5- and Nsp9-expressing plasmids, Nsp9 was shown to co-localize with DDX5 in the cytoplasm with a perinuclear pattern, and meanwhile in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells and PAMs, endogenous DDX5 was also found to co-localize with Nsp9. Finally, silencing the DDX5 gene in MARC-145 cells significantly impacted the replication of PRRSV, and while the over-expression of DDX5 could slightly enhance viral replication.

Objectives To investigate the epidemiological history and initial clinical characteristics of 10 patients with family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Western Chongqing, China. Study design Ten patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection by real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), were collected from The People\u0027s Hospital of Dazu District, Chongqing. Epidemiological data and laboratory and imaging results were collected on the first day of admission, and analyzed based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for COVID-19 (5th edition, China). Results Of the 10 cases, case A had a history of a temporary stay in Wuhan and transmitted the virus to the others through family gathering, living together, and sharing vehicles. The average age was 56.5 years (\u00B1 11.16), six patients were males, and the incubation period was 2\u201314 days. Dry cough was the main symptom, followed by fever and fatigue. Most patients were clinically classified as ordinary-type, with three cases being severe-type. Chest computed tomography results were nonspecific, mainly with ground-glass attenuation and/or shadow images. Extensive lesion distribution was seen in severe cases. CD4\u002B lymphocyte counts were 61, 180, and 348 cells/uL in severe-type patients, respectively. Notably, viral nucleic acid values in nasopharyngeal swabs were lower (19, 25, and 26) than those of ordinary-type patients, suggesting a higher viral load. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was also higher in severe-type patients Conclusions Initial examination results of lower CD4\u002B lymphocyte counts and RT-PCR-CT values coupled with higher NLR may indicate the severity of COVID-19 infection for these family clusters.","publish_time":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xia, Xiao-ying; Wu, Jing; Liu, He-lei; Xia, Hong; Jia, Bei; Huang, Wen-xiang","journal":"Journal of Clinical Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43e94b156dd3088b39c967b0cfee10632fb69fcf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7151291.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104360; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301025; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305025/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjszOTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The People\u0027s Hospital of Dazu District","NLR"],"locations":["China","Western Chongqing","Wuhan"],"keyphrases":["ordinary-type patients","severe cases","patients positive","China","severe-type patients Conclusions Initial examination results of lower CD4","higher NLR","imaging results","lymphocyte counts","SARS-CoV","viral nucleic acid values","family aggregation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","RT-PCR","epidemiological history","infection","higher viral load","severity of COVID","family clusters","Wuhan","Chest computed tomography results","nucleic acid detection","Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio","CT values","coronavirus disease","Epidemiological data","Western Chongqing","initial clinical characteristics","real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction","nasopharyngeal swabs","main symptom","ground-glass attenuation","People\u0027s Hospital of Dazu District","laboratory","Study design","cells","Extensive lesion distribution","new outbreak","incubation period","temporary stay","fever","Dry cough","shadow images","Diagnosis","Treatment Guideline","males","average age","years","days","fatigue","Objectives","Hubei","edition","Abstract Background","day of admission","vehicles"],"language":"en"},

Furthermore, IFITM3 gene has been considered as a preferential marker for inflammatory diseases, and positive correlation to pathological grades. Therefore, we assumed that IFITM3 was regulated by different signal pathways. To better understand IFITM3 function in inflammatory response, we cloned swine IFITM3 gene, and detected IFITM3 distribution in tissues, as well as characterized this gene. Results indicated that the length of swine IFITM3 gene was 438 bp, encoding 145 amino acids. IFITM3 gene expression abundance was higher in spleen and lungs. Moreover, we next constructed the eukaryotic expression vector PBIFM3 and transfected into PK15 cells, finally obtained swine IFITM3 gene stable expression cell line. Meanwhile, we explored the effects of LPS on swine IFITM3 expression. Results showed that LPS increased IFITM3 mRNA abundance and exhibited time-dependent effect for LPS treatment. To further demonstrate the mechanism that IFITM3 regulated type I IFNs production, we also detected the important molecules expression of TLR4 signaling pathway. In transfected and non-transfected IFITM3 PK15 cells, LPS exacerbated the relative expression of TLR4-NF\u03BAB signaling molecules. However, the IFITM3 overexpression suppressed the inflammatory development of PK15 cells. In conclusion, these data indicated that the overexpression of swine IFITM3 could decrease the inflammatory response through TLR4 signaling pathway, and participate in type I interferon production.

Till date, DNA testing in microbiology has been directed predominantly to the detection of organisms that are difficult to culture in vitro, or for various reasons the growth is unlikely. DNA analysis can be used successfully in infections in which there is a mix of pathogens. Apart from the straightforward diagnostic applications, DNA microbiological testing has been used to detect antimicrobial resistance or toxigenic forms of E. coli. More recently, the availability of DNA technology to quantitate HCV and HIV has been useful in planning and monitoring treatment. The pathogenesis of many infections, particularly viral ones, can also be realized from experimental strategies based on light and electron microscopy, cell culture and immunoassay. The advantages that are provided by DNA techniques include the ability to detect latent (non-replicating) viruses and to localize their genomes to nuclear or cytoplasmic regions within cells. Nucleic acid probe techniques (NAT) can also be manipulated to enable a broad spectrum of serotypes to be detectable. This is particularly valuable in those emerging infections where the underlying serotypes are unknown.","publish_time":"2005-12-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Trent, Ronald J","journal":"Molecular Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b2d340ec310542eb706f2569b0a4f0e1871e42c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7149788.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780126990577500084; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780126990577500084","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["DNA testing","DNA techniques","DNA analysis","DNA microbiological testing","availability of DNA technology","mix of pathogens","emerging infections","emergence of new pathogens","underlying serotypes","cell culture","broad spectrum of serotypes","Nucleic acid probe techniques","electron microscopy","light","development","HCV","HIV","straightforward diagnostic applications","cytoplasmic regions","toxigenic forms of","genomes","planning","viruses","non-replicating","antimicrobial resistance","NAT","immunoassay","bioterrorism","Publisher Summary","rapid methods","added urgency","experimental strategies","various reasons","growth","cells","coli","monitoring treatment","concern","date","microbiology","viral ones","detection of organisms","potential virulence","pathogenesis","advantages"],"language":"en"},

The concomitant increase in antibiotic use along with the ease with which organisms develop mechanisms of resistance have together become a medical crisis, underscoring the importance of developing innovative and effective antimicrobial strategies. Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenously produced molecule with many physiologic functions, including broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and immunomodulatory properties. The risk of resistance to NO is minimized because NO has multiple mechanisms of antimicrobial action. NO\u0027s clinical utility has been limited largely because it is highly reactive and lacks appropriate vehicles for storage and delivery. To harness NO\u0027s antimicrobial potential, a variety exogenous NO delivery platforms have been developed and evaluated, yet limitations preclude their use in the clinical setting. Nanotechnology represents a paradigm through which these limitations can be overcome, allowing for the encapsulation, controlled release, and focused delivery of NO for the treatment of SSTI.

We identified 386 studies from the total of 24,823 studies identified in a systematic search of four bibliographic databases. We performed meta-analyses of studies on tuberculosis, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-Coronavirus and pneumonia. One single-nucleotide polymorphism from IL4 gene was significant for pooled respiratory infections (rs2070874; 1.66 [1.29\u20132.14]). We also detected an association of TLR2 gene with tuberculosis (rs5743708; 3.19 [2.03\u20135.02]). Subset analyses identified CCL2 as an additional risk factor for tuberculosis (rs1024611; OR = 0.79 [0.72\u20130.88]). The IL4-TLR2-CCL2 axis could be a highly interesting target for translation towards clinical use. However, this conclusion is based on low credibility of evidence - almost 95% of all identified studies had strong risk of bias or confounding. Future studies must build upon larger-scale collaborations, but also strictly adhere to the highest evidence-based principles in study design, in order to reduce research waste and provide clinically translatable evidence.","publish_time":"2015-11-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patar\u010Di\u0107, Inga; Gelemanovi\u0107, Andrea; Kirin, Mirna; Kol\u010Di\u0107, Ivana; Theodoratou, Evropi; Baillie, Kenneth J.; de Jong, Menno D.; Rudan, Igor; Campbell, Harry; Pola\u0161ek, Ozren","journal":"Sci Rep","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4a7c2c60763755a14783f728e9b4cde8bf899f09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4630784.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26524966/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep16119","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["identified studies","replication studies","Future studies","tuberculosis","meta-analyses of studies","IL4 gene","IL4-TLR2","translatable evidence","highest evidence-based principles","respiratory syncytial virus","pooled respiratory infections","respiratory infectious diseases","association of TLR2 gene","low credibility of evidence","CCL2 axis","Subset analyses","additional risk factor","strong risk of bias","influenza","study design","interesting target","SARS-Coronavirus","inconsistent results","order","single-nucleotide polymorphism","research waste","translation","clinical use","rs2070874","systematic search","rs1024611","bibliographic databases","pneumonia","confounding","larger-scale collaborations","rs5743708","Host genetic factors","conclusion","total"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, a novel metastasis-related gene, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), was characterized for its role in CRC metastasis and underlying molecular mechanisms. The clinical significance of FGL2 was investigated using tissue microarray analysis of samples from 82 patients with CRC. The molecular effects of FGL2 in CRC cells were determined using RNA interference and ectopic expression of FGL2. The overexpression of FGL2 was examined by immunohistochemistry in 82 CRC patients, and it was determined to be an independent predictor of overall survival (P \u003C 0.05). The depletion of FGL2 expression inhibited tumor progression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo, while ectopic overexpression of FGL2 enhanced cell invasion and induced EMT in vitro.

CPV\u20102 belongs to the Protoparvovirus genus in the family Parvoviridae. An amino acid change at position 426 of the VP2 protein differentiate types of CPV\u20102, designated as CPV\u20102a (Asn), CPV\u20102b (Asp), and CPV\u20102c (Glu). In this study, we compared CPV\u20102 genotyping results obtained by SimpleProbe(\u00AE) real\u2010time PCR and DNA sequencing analysis to identify the accuracy and sensitivity of these methods. METHODS: One hundred rectal swabs were collected from CPV\u20102 naturally infected dogs from 2015 to 2017 at the Animal Disease Diagnostic Center, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology. CPV\u20102 genotyping was performed by SimpleProbe(\u00AE) real\u2010time PCR and DNA sequencing to compare results. RESULTS: CPV\u20102a (n = 23), 2b (n = 6) and 2c (n = 71) genotyping results obtained by both techniques were identical with specificity of 100% for SimpleProbe(\u00AE) assay. In the SimpleProbe(\u00AE) assay, amplifying the DNAs prepared from the clinical specimens showed three distinct melting curve peaks. CPV\u20102b had the highest melting peak of 57.8\u00B0C (CI 95%: 57.7\u201058.5\u00B0C) followed by CPV\u20102c with a slightly lower melting peak of 52.3\u00B0C (CI 95%: 52.2\u201053.2\u00B0C) and CPV\u20102a with the lowest peak of 50.2\u00B0C (CI 95%: 50.1\u201050.5\u00B0C). CONCLUSION: This study developed a novel method for genotyping CPV\u20102 strains using the SimpleProbe(\u00AE) real\u2010time PCR assay.

The H1N1 pandemic highlighted challenges in public health decision-making during a public health emergency. Understanding this process to identify barriers and modifiable influences is important to improve the response to future emergencies. The purpose of this study is to examine the H1N1 pandemic decision-making process in Canada with an emphasis on the use of evidence for public health decisions. Using semi-structured key informant interviews conducted after the pandemic (July\u2013November 2010) and a document analysis, we examined four highly debated pandemic policies: use of adjuvanted vaccine by pregnant women, vaccine priority groups and sequencing, school closures and personal protective equipment. Data were analysed for thematic content guided by Lomas\u0027 policy decision-making framework as well as indicative coding using iterative methods. We interviewed 40 public health officials and scientific advisors across Canada and reviewed 76 pandemic policy documents. Our analysis revealed that pandemic pre-planning resulted in strong beliefs, which defined the decision-making process. Existing ideological perspectives of evidence strongly influenced how information was used such that the same evidentiary sources were interpreted differently according to the ideological perspective. Participants recognized that current models for public health decision-making failed to make explicit the roles of scientific evidence in relation to contextual factors. Conflict avoidance theory explained policy decisions that went against the prevailing evidence. Clarification of roles and responsibilities within the public health system would reduce duplication and maintain credibility. A more transparent and iterative approach to incorporating evidence into public health decision-making that reflects the realities of the external pressures present during a public health emergency is needed.","publish_time":"2013-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rosella, Laura C.; Wilson, Kumanan; Crowcroft, Natasha S.; Chu, Anna; Upshur, Ross; Willison, Donald; Deeks, Shelley L.; Schwartz, Brian; Tustin, Jordan; Sider, Doug; Goel, Vivek","journal":"Social Science \u0026 Medicine","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/59e70474f7eae42943ba63363f887cdaa91e29f9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125641.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23465198/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953613000828; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.02.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953613000828","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxMTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["public health decision-making","public health decisions","public health emergency","public health system","public health officials","H1N1 pandemic decision-making process","lack of public confidence","use of evidence","pandemic policy documents","roles of scientific evidence","debated pandemic policies","prevailing evidence","Lomas\u0027 policy decision-making framework","pandemic pre-planning","H1N1 pandemic highlighted challenges","policy decisions","Existing ideological perspectives of evidence","Canada","adjuvanted vaccine","scientific advisors","iterative approach","Clarification of roles","iterative methods","document analysis","vaccine priority groups","novel infectious disease outbreak","sequencing","school closures","pregnant women","unintended consequences","thematic content","indicative coding","strong beliefs","result","relation","responsibilities","personal protective equipment","current models","realities","emphasis","semi-structured key informant interviews","modifiable influences","external pressures","response","barriers","Conflict avoidance theory","contextual factors","duplication","time constraints","uncertainty","ability","Participants","study","future emergencies","credibility","Data","information","evidentiary sources","purpose"],"language":"en"},

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R(0)), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R(0) as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be \u223C4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be \u223C3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R(0) was found to be \u223C2.6 based on confirmed cases and \u223C2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with a lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around \u223C0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.","publish_time":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Anastassopoulou, Cleo; Russo, Lucia; Tsakris, Athanasios; Siettos, Constantinos","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/77e305d16c96f220ddfe23abe6308b94c266bcbf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108749.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32231374/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230405","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsxNDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SIRD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["confirmed number of infected","infected cases","confirmed number of recovered cases","cumulative number of infected","number of infected individuals","China","official counts of confirmed cases","scenario","reported data","number of deaths unchanged","times","actual numbers of infected","basic reproduction number","actual cumulative numbers of infected","case fatality ratio","hospitalization of infected individuals","SIRD simulations","official numbers","total population","reported ones","case recovery ratios","Hubei Province","unfolding outbreak","available epidemiological data","suspected case of coronavirus disease","SIRD model","expected value of R","basis","estimated average value of R","main epidemiological parameters","recovery rates","estimations","significant decline","quarantine","Dead","day infection mortality","SIDR","severe control measures","note of caution","Susceptible-Infectious","epicenter","estimates","Wuhan","subset","mild courses","forecasting","COVID","analysis","confidence intervals","evolution","weeks","death toll","calculations","end","various factors","evoking fear","period"],"language":"en"},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A retrospective study was performed of all hospitalized patients at the peak of the pH1N1 season in whom a single respiratory virus was detected by a molecular assay targeting 18 viruses/subtypes (RVP, Luminex xTAG). Fifty-two percent (615/1192) of patients from October, 2009 to December, 2009 had a single respiratory virus (291 pH1N1; 207 rhinovirus; 45 RSV A/B; 37 parainfluenza; 27 adenovirus; 6 coronavirus; and 2 metapneumovirus). No seasonal influenza A or B was detected. Individuals with pH1N1, compared to other viruses, were more likely to present with fever (92% \u0026 70%), cough (92% \u0026 86%), sore throat (32% \u0026 16%), nausea (31% \u0026 8%), vomiting (39% \u0026 30%), abdominal pain (14% \u0026 7%), and a lower white blood count (8,500/L \u0026 13,600/L, all p-values\u003C0.05).

The anatomical structure of the respiratory system is changed during pregnancy, and the virus transmitted by droplets and aerosols is more easily inhaled by pregnant women and is difficult to remove. Furthermore, the prognosis is worse after infection when compared with non-pregnancy women. And changes in reproductive hormones and immune systems during pregnancy collectively make them more susceptible to certain infections. More importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been proven highly increased during pregnancy, which may contribute to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic. Particularly, drugs that show superior maternal and fetal safety are worthy of consideration for pregnant women with COVID-19, such as chloroquine, metformin, statins, lobinavir/ritonavir, glycyrrhizic acid, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery (NMDD), etc. Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19, and special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs that are both effective for maternal diseases and friendly to the fetus. However, there are still many deficiencies in the study of drug safety during pregnancy, and broad-spectrum, effective and fetal-safe drugs for pregnant women need to be developed so as to cope with more infectious diseases in the future.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhao, Xiaoxuan; Jiang, Yuepeng; Zhao, Yang; Xi, Hongyan; Liu, Chang; Qu, Fan; Feng, Xiaoling","journal":"Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4d18b1c195fd0e9bf990f0fc4e9af0ac8c64ed69.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178925.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-020-03897-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328850/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMDA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-pregnancy women","COVID","susceptibility of pregnant women","existing drugs","selection of drugs","fetal-safe drugs","old drugs","specific drugs","SARS-CoV","susceptibility of SARS","fetal safety","drug selection","screens effective","fetal-safe treatments","immune changes","study of drug safety","maternal diseases","virus","reproductive endocrine","immune systems","reproductive hormones","nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery","aspects of anatomical","anatomical structure","existing literature","infectious diseases","worthy of consideration","lobinavir","ritonavir","glycyrrhizic acid","NMDD","statins","paper","metformin","chloroquine","respiratory system","new use","ACE","fetus","evidence","clinic","deficiencies","aerosols","receptor","emergency method","special attention","angiotensin","enzyme","pandemic","prognosis","future","certain infections","droplets","present"],"language":"en"},

Methods This was a nested case-control study. A questionnaire was distributed to the study cohort two weeks after the Hajj period and was self-administered by all recruited subjects. In addition, the medical records of study subjects were reviewed at Al-Hada Hospital for the same period in order to document ARI. Results The attack rate for ARI among study subjects during Hajj season or within two weeks of returning was 25.6% (64/250). Logistic regression analysis of factors related to acquiring ARI revealed that contact with pilgrims imposed an extremely high risk of infection (adjusted OR 13.2, 95% CI 1.5\u2013117.6). Moreover, non-use of alcohol-based hand disinfection carried a more than 8-fold risk of acquiring ARI compared to those who always used alcohol for hand disinfection (adjusted OR 8.4, 95% CI 2.2\u201332.2). Smoking was also a predictor of ARI in our cohort and influenza vaccination was associated with a 30% reduction in ARI compared to unvaccinated subjects, although this finding was not statistically significant. Unexpectedly, the logistic regression model showed that Saudi nationals were three times more likely to acquire ARI than non-Saudis (adjusted OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2\u20138.4). Conclusions The common practice among pilgrims and medical personnel of using surgical facemasks to protect themselves against ARI should be discontinued and regular use of alcohol-based hand scrubs should be more vigorously encouraged. Further research is needed to evaluate the protective value of N95 facemasks against ARI during the Hajj period.","publish_time":"2007-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Al-Asmary, Saeed; Al-Shehri, Abdul-Salam; Abou-Zeid, Alaa; Abdel-Fattah, Moataz; Hifnawy, Tamer; El-Said, Tarek","journal":"International Journal of Infectious Diseases","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/31ab6847a110bd234cacdbfbef3f54177158232e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7110589.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197120600124X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197120600124X","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjsyMjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Taif Armed Forces Hospitals","ARI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["predictor of ARI","fold risk of acquiring ARI","Hajj period","study cohort","Hajj season","medical records of study subjects","Hajj medical mission","medical personnel","unvaccinated subjects","recruited subjects","based hand disinfection","pilgrims","based hand scrubs","non-use of alcohol","influenza vaccination","nested case-control study","Al-Hada Hospital","regular use of alcohol","logistic regression model","surgical facemasks","protective value of N95 facemasks","Logistic regression analysis of factors","weeks of returning","effectiveness of protective measures","high risk of infection","prevalence of acute respiratory tract infections","Saudi nationals","Taif Armed Forces Hospitals","common practice","times","attack rate","non-Saudis","Conclusions","finding","addition","contact","order","reduction","Summary Objectives","Methods","Smoking","questionnaire","research"],"language":"en"},

The development has been understood as a climate change adaptation strategy and as a means to improve climate resilience. Since 2003, development organizations have started to further the trend by distributing camels in the region. Up to now, little has been known about the nature of, reasons for, or ramifications of the increased reliance on camels.

Acute phase proteins are one of the key components of innate immunity and studies describing their use as a monitoring tool for the immune system in animals undergoing interferon\u2010\u03C9 therapy are lacking. This study aimed to determine whether interferon\u2010\u03C9 therapy influences acute phase protein concentrations namely serum amyloid\u2010A, \u03B1\u20101\u2010glycoprotein and C\u2010reactive protein.

Factors associated with codetection were age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for age \u003C12 months = 4.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0, 7.9; age 12 to \u003C24 months = 6.0, 95% CI 3.7, 9.8; age 24 to \u003C60 months = 2.4, 95% CI 1.5, 3.9), male gender (aOR 1.46; 95% CI 1.1, 2.0), child care attendance (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.4, 2.8) and winter enrollment (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3, 3.0). Haemophilus influenzae dominated the virus\u2013bacteria pairs. Virus\u2013H. influenzae interactions in ARI should be investigated further, especially as the contribution of nontypeable H. influenzae to acute and chronic respiratory diseases is being increasingly recognized.","publish_time":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"O\u0027Grady, K.

Recently, the importance of de novo origination has been recognized in eukaryotes, although eukaryotic genes originated de novo are relatively rare and difficult to identify. In contrast, viruses contain many de novo genes, namely those in which an existing gene has been \u201Coverprinted\u201D by a new open reading frame, a process that generates a new protein-coding gene overlapping the ancestral gene. We analyzed the evolution of 12 experimentally validated viral genes that originated de novo and estimated their relative ages. We found that young de novo genes have a different codon usage from the rest of the genome. They evolve rapidly and are under positive or weak purifying selection. Thus, young de novo genes might have strain-specific functions, or no function, and would be difficult to detect using current genome annotation methods that rely on the sequence signature of purifying selection. In contrast to young de novo genes, older de novo genes have a codon usage that is similar to the rest of the genome. They evolve slowly and are under stronger purifying selection. Some of the oldest de novo genes evolve under stronger selection pressure than the ancestral gene they overlap, suggesting an evolutionary tug of war between the ancestral and the de novo gene.","publish_time":"2012-07-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sabath, Niv; Wagner, Andreas; Karlin, David","journal":"Mol Biol Evol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7db910e35a0a22ccef05b0a5b4c9789acfef2daa.json; document_parses/pdf_json/61610467351ceab87933d94e3c6e487654d316a8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3494269.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22821011/; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/mss179","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjszNjM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novo genes","novo origination","viral genes","eukaryotic genes","modification of existing genes","New protein-coding genes","ancestral gene","stronger purifying selection","weak purifying selection","stronger selection pressure","sequence signature of purifying selection","rest","contrast","different codon usage","new open reading frame","current genome annotation methods","process","strain-specific functions","eukaryotes","evolutionary tug of war","viruses","relative ages","importance"],"language":"en"},

Alere i RSV is a novel molecular rapid test which identifies respiratory syncytial virus in less than 13 min. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical performance of the Alere i RSV assay in a pediatric point-of-care setting during winter season 2016 / 2017. Test results from 518 nasopharyngeal swab samples were compared to a real-time reverse transcription PCR reference standard. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of the Alere i RSV test assay was 93% (CI(95) 89% \u2013 96%) and 96% (CI(95) 93% \u2013 98%), respectively. Alere i RSV performed well in children of all age groups. An optimal sensitivity of 98% (CI(95) 94% - 100%) and specificity of 96% (CI(95) 90% - 99%) was obtained in children \u003C 6 months. In children \u2265 2 years, sensitivity and specificity remained at 87% (CI(95) 73% \u2013 96%) and 98% (CI(95) 92% \u2013 100%), respectively. False negative Alere i RSV test results mostly occurred in samples with low viral load (mean CT value 31.1; CI(95) 29.6 \u2013 32.6). The Alere i RSV assay is easy to use and can be operated after minimal initial training. Test results are available within 13 min, with most RSV positive samples being identified after approximately 5 min. CONCLUSION: The Alere i RSV assay has the potential to facilitate the detection of RSV in pediatric point-of-care settings.

Due to the overwhelming prevalence and incidence rates of HIV, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, it is necessary to develop new and affordable treatments. Aim of the study The article provides an extensive overview of the status on investigation of plants from the southern African region with ethnobotanical use for treating HIV or HIV-related symptoms, or the management of HIV. The review also provide an account of the in vitro assays, anti-viral activity and phytochemistry of these plants. Materials and methods Peer-reviewed articles investigating plants with ethnobotanical information for the treatment or management of HIV or HIV-related symptoms from the southern African region were acquired from Science Direct, PubMed central and Google Scholar. The selection criteria was that (1) plants should have a record of traditional/popular use for infectious or viral diseases, HIV treatment or symptoms similar to HIV infection, (2) if not traditionally/popularly used, plants should be closely related to plants with popular use and HIV activity identified by means of in vitro assays, (3) plants should have been identified scientifically, (4) should be native to southern African region and (5) anti-HIV activity should be within acceptable ranges. Results Many plants in Africa and specifically the southern African region have been used for the treatment of HIV or HIV related symptoms and have been investigated suing various in vitro techniques. In vitro assays using HIV enzymes such as reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN) and protease (PR), proteins or cell-based assays have been employed to validate the use of these plants with occasional indication of the selectivity index (SI) or therapeutic index (TI), with only one study, that progressed to in vivo testing. The compounds identified from plants from southern Africa is similar to compounds identified from other regions of the world, and the compounds have been divided into three groups namely (1) flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides, (2) terpenoids and terpenoid glycosides and (3) phenolic acids and their conjugated forms. Conclusions An investigation of the plants from southern Africa with ethnobotanical use for the treatment of HIV, management of HIV or HIV-related symptoms, therefore provide a very good analysis of the major assays employed and the anti-viral compounds and compound groups identified. The similarity in identified anti-viral compounds worldwide should support the progression from in vitro studies to in vivo testing in development of affordable and effective anti-HIV agents for countries with high infection and mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS.","publish_time":"2018-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Prinsloo, Gerhard; Marokane, Cynthia K.; Street, Ren\u00E9e A.","journal":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/729f663149bdb9441f3804fa903ba109a418f700.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125770.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874117301265; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.08.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28807850/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874117301265","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU1LmNzdjs0MDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1714866,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:37Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"W59t/r1LSwHDtPOXTxrZ4Q==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_55.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HIV","Science Direct"],"locations":["Africa"],"keyphrases":["HIV treatment","treatment of HIV","management of HIV","HIV infection","HIV enzymes","HIV-related symptoms","HIV related symptoms","anti-HIV activity","incidence rates of HIV","effective anti-HIV agents","investigation of plants","southern African region","anti-viral compounds","ethnobotanical use","anti-viral activity","symptoms similar","popular use","African continent","viral diseases","major assays","sub-Saharan Africa","cell-based assays","ethnobotanical information","testing","study","high infection","mortality rates","selectivity index","therapeutic index","development of affordable","affordable treatments","flavonoid glycosides","terpenoid glycosides","compound groups","countries","home","Science Direct","large number of higher plant species","methods Peer-reviewed articles","reverse transcriptase","occasional indication","PubMed central","extensive overview","proteins","Abstract Ethnopharmacological relevance","phytochemistry","Google Scholar","phenolic acids","record of traditional","centuries","integrase","Materials","terpenoids","status","overwhelming prevalence","progression","good analysis","acceptable ranges","conjugated forms","protease","studies","flavonoids","regions","AIDS","account","similarity","applications","world","Conclusions","selection criteria","techniques"],"language":"en"},

BAC vector sequences were inserted into the thymidine kinase gene of HSV-2 by homologous recombination. DNA from cells infected with the resulting recombinant virus was transformed into E. coli, and colonies containing the HSV-2 BAC (HSV2-BAC) were isolated and analyzed for the expected genotype. HSV2-BAC DNA was infectious when transfected back into mammalian cells and the resulting virus was thymidine kinase negative. When used to immunize mice, the HSV2-BAC DNA elicited a strong HSV-2 specific antibody response that was equal to or greater than live virus immunization. Further, HSV2-BAC immunization was protective when animals were challenged with a lethal dose of virus. The utility of the HSV2-BAC for construction of recombinant virus genomes was demonstrated by elimination of the HSV-2 glycoprotein D (gD) gene. A recombinant HSV-2 BAC with the gD gene deleted was isolated and shown to be incapable of producing infectious virus following transfection unless an HSV gD gene was expressed in a complementing cell line. Immunization of mice with the HSV2 gD-BAC also elicited an HSV-2 specific antibody response and was protective. The results demonstrate the feasibility of DNA immunization with HSV-2 bacterial artificial chromosomes for replicating and nonreplicating candidate HSV-2 vaccines, as well as the utility of BAC technology for construction and maintenance of novel HSV-2 vaccines. The results further suggest that such technology will be a powerful tool for dissecting the immune response to HSV-2.","publish_time":"2004-01-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meseda, Clement A.; Schmeisser, Falko; Pedersen, Robin; Woerner, Amy; Weir, Jerry P.","journal":"Virology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/72de437e6d52dd0aabf73335d8df49409dfd8833.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7173264.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682203007384; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682203007384","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU2LmNzdjs5ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1706455,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:58Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"BT3ud/3hYcPx9HfhOET4Ew==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_56.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["E. coli"],"organizations":["HSV","BAC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["recombinant HSV","HSV2 gD-BAC","HSV2-BAC immunization","HSV2-BAC DNA","HSV gD gene","strong HSV","thymidine kinase gene of HSV","utility of BAC technology","nonreplicating candidate HSV","maintenance of novel HSV","resulting virus","infectious virus","BAC vector sequences","resulting recombinant virus","live virus immunization","construction of recombinant virus genomes","herpes simplex virus","lethal dose of virus","feasibility of DNA immunization","Immunization of mice","specific antibody response","Abstract Construction","immune response","vaccines","results","bacterial artificial chromosomes","thymidine kinase negative","mammalian cells","transfection","animals","elimination","glycoprotein D","powerful tool","coli","complementing cell line","colonies","homologous recombination","expected genotype"],"language":"en"},

Fatal cases of measles in Sri Lanka are rare after implementation of the National Immunization Programme in 1984. Thereafter 0.1% case fatality rate was observed during October 1999\u2013June 2000 which is a very low figure compared to other regional countries. Immunization guidelines were further revised in 2001, 2011 and in 2012 when additional immunization was recommended to age group 4\u201321 years; who are likely to have inadequate immunization, in order to achieve elimination of Measles by 2020. However, in 2013\u20132014, 4690 cases were reported and the majority were children less than 1 year of age. The occurrence in adults is hard to retrieve in published epidemiological reports, however had been 38% (out of 1008 patients) in the 3rd quarter of 2013. During this outbreak 73/101 (72%) reported from the North Central Province of Sri Lanka had been more than 12 years of age with 50% being more than 29 years. 14 Sri lankan adult patients [median age 32 years (range 25\u201348)] who presented sporadically from June 2014 to March 2016, with confirmed measles infection were enrolled retrospectively after informed consent. Details with regards to their clinical presentation, immunization and other relevant areas were collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire or using patient management records. RESULTS: The patients presented with high fever, headache, severe body aches, sore throat, dry cough, intense tearing, red eyes and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy over 3\u20135 days duration. Later they developed discrete maculopapular rash helping the diagnosis. They had a variable degree of leucopenia, lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia and derangements in the liver functions mimicking any other acute febrile illnesses such as dengue, chikungunya, leptospirosis or Zika virus infection. CONCLUSION: At least a 3\u20135 day delay in the diagnosis was observed (even after the appearance of the rash in some patients), due to non-awareness of its occurrence, unfamiliarity of measles in adults, non-specific nature of the illness and non-availability of rapid diagnostics, risking transmission to the immune-compromised or non-immune staff or patients. Identification of the source of infection in these sporadic adult cases and their virologic surveillance and molecular epidemiology will be important to interrupt the transmission and to achieve the targeted elimination of measles from Sri Lanka by 2020.","publish_time":"2017-01-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Premaratna, Ranjan; Luke, Nathasha; Perera, Harsha; Gunathilake, Mahesh; Amarasena, Pubudu; Chandrasena, T.

The imbalance in the IFN response is thought to contribute to the establishment of viremia early in infection, whereas the production of chemokines by infected organs may be responsible for (i) massive immune cell infiltrations found in the lungs of SARS victims, and (ii) the dysregulation of adaptive immunity. Here, we will review the most recent findings on the interaction of SARS-CoV and related Coronaviridae members with the type I interferon and cytokine responses and discuss implications for pathogenesis and therapy.","publish_time":"2008-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Thiel, Volker; Weber, Friedemann","journal":"Cytokine \u0026 Growth Factor Reviews","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0dfb48c89f5609eb7c645aad320b3a2c70d07ec7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108449.xml.json","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610108000026; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2008.01.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18321765/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610108000026","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzU3LmNzdjs2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1675905,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:48Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vcJPZQgecowIIB4p29Z1Hw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_57.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","interaction of SARS","lungs of SARS victims","innate immune responses","antiviral type","cytokine responses","production of chemokines","massive immune cell infiltrations","induction","research","related Coronaviridae members","sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome","multiple passive","active mechanisms","implications","interferons","identified coronavirus","causative agent","infection","infected organs","pathogenesis","tissue cells","coronaviruses","recent findings","imbalance","IFN response","dysregulation of adaptive immunity","establishment of viremia","therapy","contrast"],"language":"en"},

Although recent studies have shown that miRNAs play important roles in immune responses, the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during immunosuppressive virus infection remain unclear. METHODS: In this study, porcine small-RNA transcriptomes of PCMV-infected and uninfected vital organs were first characterised by high-throughput sequencing. miRDeep2 software was used to predict novel pig-encoded miRNAs. To verify the accuracy of the high-throughput sequencing results, stem-loop qRT-PCR was performed on 12 significantly DE miRNAs. The physical and functional interactions between the immune-related target genes of the DE miRNAs in PCMV-infected organs were analysed using the STRING database. RESULTS: In total, 306 annotated and 295 novel miRNAs were identified from PCMV-infected and uninfected porcine organs, respectively, through alignment with known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs. Overall, 92, 107, 95, 77 and 111 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in lung, liver, spleen, kidney and thymus after PCMV infection, respectively. According to Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs associated with immune system processes, regulation of biological processes and metabolic processes were enriched in every sample. Integrated expression analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs and their target mRNAs in PCMV-infected thymus showed that the significant differential expression of specific miRNAs under the pressure of PCMV infection in central immune organs interfered with the expression of genes involved in important immune-related signalling pathways, thus promoting the viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive analysis of the responses of host small-RNA transcriptomes to PCMV infection in vital porcine organs. It provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during infection by immunosuppressive viruses.

Contemporary industrial production of GA by acid hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin which was extracted from Glycyrrhiza plants, is not environment-friendly and devastates farmland since the Glycyrrhiza rhizomes grow up to 10 m underground. RESULTS: In this study, GA was produced through metabolically engineering Saccharomyces cerevisiae by introducing the entire heterogeneous biosynthetic pathway of GA. Codon optimized CYP88D6 and CYP72A154, combined with \u03B2-AS (\u03B2-amyrin synthase encoding gene) and the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase gene of Arabidopsis thaliana were introduced into S. cerevisiae. The resulting strain (Y1) produced 2.5 mg/L of \u03B2-amyrin and 14 \u03BCg/L of GA. The cytochrome b5 from G. uralensis (GuCYB5) was identified and the introduction of this novel GuCYB5 increased the efficiency of GA production by eightfold. The joint utilization of the GuCYB5 gene along with 10 known MVA pathway genes from S. cerevisiae were overexpressed in a stable chromosome integration to achieve higher GA production. Using the combined strategy, GA concentration improved by 40-fold during batch fermentation. The production was further improved to 8.78 mg/L in fed-batch fermentation, which was increased by a factor of nearly 630. CONCLUSIONS: This study first investigated the influence of carbon flux in the upstream module and the introduction of a newly identified GuCYB5 on GA production. The newly identified GuCYB5 was highly effective in improving GA production. An integrated strategy including enzyme discovery, pathway optimization, and fusion protein construction was provided in improving GA production, achieving a 630 fold increase in GA production. The metabolically engineered yeast cell factories provide an alternative approach to glycyrrhetinic acid production, replacing the traditional method of plant extraction.

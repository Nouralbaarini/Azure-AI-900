Current approaches are driven by practical considerations (e.g. first available virus isolate) rather than a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the virus strain chosen, which can lead to animal models that are not representative of the circulating or emerging clusters. Here, we suggest a combination of epidemiological, experimental and bioinformatics considerations when choosing virus strains for animal model generation. We discuss the currently chosen SARS-CoV-2 strains for international coronavirus disease (COVID-19) models in the context of their phylogeny as well as in a novel alignment-free bioinformatics approach. Unlike phylogenetic trees, which focus on individual shared mutations, this new approach assesses genome-wide co-developing functionalities and hence offers a more fluid view of the \u0022cloud of variances\u0022 that RNA viruses are prone to accumulate. This joint approach concludes that while the current animal models cover the existing viral strains adequately, there is substantial evolutionary activity that is likely not considered by the current models. Based on insights from the non-discrete alignment-free approach and experimental observations, we suggest isolates for future animal models.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bauer, Denis C; Tay, Aidan P; Wilson, Laurence O W; Reti, Daniel; Hosking, Cameron; McAuley, Alexander J; Pharo, Elizabeth; Todd, Shawn; Stevens, Vicky; Neave, Matthew J; Tachedjian, Mary; Drew, Trevor W; Vasan, S S","journal":"Transboundary and emerging diseases","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306500/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0OTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["current animal models","current models","future animal models","virus strains","new approach","joint approach","animal model generation","novel alignment-free bioinformatics approach","non-discrete alignment-free approach","bioinformatics considerations","available virus","Current approaches","existing viral strains","experimental observations","practical considerations","best isolates","international coronavirus disease","infectious disease outbreaks","chosen SARS-CoV","genome-wide co-developing functionalities","individual shared mutations","cloud of variances","COVID","diagnostics","RNA viruses","Pre-clinical responses","substantial evolutionary activity","characteristics","vaccines","combination of epidemiological","circulating","emerging clusters","fluid view","insights","detailed analysis","phylogeny","phylogenetic trees","treatments","context"],"language":"en"},

PURPOSE To review multiple streams of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of ventilation techniques for coronavirus infections, including that causing COVID-19. (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020178187). DATA SOURCES 21 standard, World Health Organization-specific and COVID-19-specific databases, without language restrictions, until 1 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION Studies of any design and language comparing different oxygenation approaches in patients with coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence was gathered regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus. Studies evaluating risk for virus transmission to health care workers from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were included. DATA EXTRACTION Independent and duplicate screening, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment (GRADE for certainty of evidence and AMSTAR 2 for included systematic reviews). DATA SYNTHESIS 123 studies were eligible (45 on COVID-19, 70 on SARS, 8 on MERS), but only 5 studies (1 on COVID-19, 3 on SARS, 1 on MERS) adjusted for important confounders. A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence). Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy. Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs. LIMITATION Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported. CONCLUSION Indirect and low-certainty evidence suggests that use of NIV, similar to IMV, probably reduces mortality but may increase the risk for transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers.

To date however no review exists to identify, map and analyse the literature in this area in order to understand 1) which marginalised groups have been studied in terms of patient safety research, 2) what the particular patient safety issues are for such groups and 3) what contributes to or is associated with these safety issues arising. METHODS Scoping review. Systematic searches were performed across six electronic databases in September 2019. The time frame for searches of the respective databases was from the year 2000 until present day. RESULTS The searches yielded 3346 articles, and 67 articles were included. Patient safety issues were identified for fourteen different marginalised patient groups across all studies, with 69% (n = 46) of the studies focused on four patient groups: ethnic minority groups, frail elderly populations, care home residents and low socio-economic status. Twelve separate patient safety issues were classified. Just over half of the studies focused on three issues represented in the patient safety literature, and in order of frequency were: medication safety, adverse outcomes and near misses. In total, 157 individual contributing or associated factors were identified and mapped to one of seven different factor types from the Framework of Contributory Factors Influencing Clinical Practice within the London Protocol. Patient safety issues were mostly multifactorial in origin including patient factors, health provider factors and health care system factors. CONCLUSIONS This review highlights that marginalised patient groups are vulnerable to experiencing a variety patient safety issues and points to a number of gaps. The findings indicate the need for further research to understand the intersectional nature of marginalisation and the multi-dimensional nature of patient safety issues, for groups that have been under-researched, including those with mental health problems, communication and cognitive impairments. Such understanding provides a basis for working collaboratively to co-design training, services and/or interventions designed to remove or at the very least minimise these increased risks.

Then the inter-dependencies between the barriers are studied by developing the correlation indices between the sub-categories. Results indicate that addressing the economic, social and regulatory barriers should be prioritized. Although the impact of barriers under perception, risk, compliance and market sub-categories are very pronounced, the highest inter-dependency among the sub-categories is found between perception and risk. It suggests that the perception of the stakeholders about building components reuse is affected by the potential risks associated with this intervention.","publish_time":"2020-02-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rakhshan, Kambiz; Morel, Jean-Claude; Alaka, Hafiz; Charef, Rabia","journal":"Waste management \u0026 research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x20910463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32116140/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reuse of components","components reuse","Widespread reuse of building components","factors","building sector","market sub-categories","major categories","perception","regulatory barriers","impact of barriers","single study","intervention","inter-dependencies","highest inter-dependency","peer-reviewed journal articles","compliance","systematic literature review","circularity of materials","potential risks","correlation indices","stakeholders","superstructure","mainstream practise","studies","correlations","Results","circumstances"],"language":"en"},

Up to 90% of individuals with dementia experience neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). However, the limitations of current treatments for NPS have drivent he search for safer pharmacotherapies-including cannabinoids. AIM To assess the efficacy and acceptability of cannabinoids for the treatment of NPS in individuals with dementia. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Of 6,902 papers, 9 were eligible (n = 205, 44% female, 78 \u00B1 7 years, 85% Alzheimer disease). Trials were in North America and Europe and explored tetrahydrocannabinol (n = 3), dronabinol (n = 5), or nabilone (n = 1). MEASUREMENT Titles/abstracts were independently screened by one reviewer and reviewed by a second. Full-text screening was by two reviewers with discrepancies resolved via a third reviewer. We extracted data on the standardized mean difference (SMD) for several NPS instruments, trial completion, and adverse events. Data were pooled using random-effects models. FINDINGS Cannabinoids led to significant improvements across NPS instruments, including the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (SMD = -0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.45 to -0.16), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (SMD = -0.61; CI, -1.07 to -0.15), and nocturnal actigraphy (SMD = -1.05; CI, -1.56 to -0.54h). Cannabinoids were well-tolerated, with an overall trial completion rate of 93% (193/205) and no serious treatment-related adverse events. Treatment efficacy was associated with baseline dementia severity and dose, but not dementia subtype, age, or sex. The overall study quality was rated as low. CONCLUSIONS There is preliminary evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of cannabinoids as treatments for NPS. Population-based studies are needed to characterize their real-world effectiveness and acceptability.","publish_time":"2019-12-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bahji, Anees; Meyyappan, Arthi Chinna; Hawken, Emily R","journal":"Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Yet, limited data, if any, are currently available on the role of ECMO in critically ill patients with COVID-19. We aimed at providing a snapshot analysis of ECMO for COVID-19 in Europe. METHODS Freely available data on ECMO in COVID-19 patients reported by the European Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (EuroELSO) were extracted and analyzed after conversion into long format. The primary outcome was the incidence of death during ECMO. Bootstrapping and logistic regression was used for inferential estimates. RESULTS Details from a total of 333 patients treated in 90 institutions spanning 17 countries were obtained, with 22% women and mean age of 52 years. Death rate was 17.1% (95% confidence interval: 13.1% to 21.1%), even if significant between-center differences were found, with some institutions reporting 100% case fatality. Exploratory inferential analysis showed no nominally statistically significant association between death and gender (p=0.788), but a significant association was found with age, mainly due to increased case fatality in subjects \u003E60 years (odds ratio: 4.80 [95% confidence interval 1.64 to 14.04], p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS ECMO may play an important role in critically ill patients with COVID-19 refractory to less invasive treatments. The increased risk of early death in older patients may be used to prioritize ECMO indication in resource-conscious settings, if confirmed externally.","publish_time":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Marullo, Antonino G; Cavarretta, Elena; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Mancone, Massimo; Peruzzi, Mariangela; Piscioneri, Fernando; Sartini, Patrizio; Versaci, Francesco; Morelli, Andrea; Miraldi, Fabio; Frati, Giacomo","journal":"Minerva cardioangiologica","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4725.20.05328-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336080/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs1NTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ECMO","European Extracorporeal Life Support Organization"],"locations":["Europe"],"keyphrases":["COVID","role of ECMO","ECMO indication","CONCLUSIONS ECMO","ill patients","snapshot analysis of ECMO","older patients","incidence of death","significant association","Death rate","severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus","years","increased risk of early death","increased case fatality","available data","institutions","confidence interval","acute respiratory distress syndrome","Exploratory inferential analysis","important role","mean age","inferential estimates","limited data","severe cases extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","Coronavirus-associated disease","European Extracorporeal Life Support Organization","subjects","EuroELSO","refractory","BACKGROUND Infection","resource-conscious settings","ARDS","gender","odds ratio","logistic regression","primary outcome","women","SARS-CoV","total","METHODS","RESULTS Details","invasive treatments","center differences","conversion","long format","countries"],"language":"en"},

Herein we searched SU efficiency according to the genotype-phenotype correlation, dosage used and side effects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Systematic review conducted according the PRISMA control criteria identifying relevant studies evaluating the in vivo and in vitro sensitivity of ATP-dependent potassium channels according to the characteristics of genetic mutation. RESULTS 103 selected articles with complete data in 502 cases in whom 413 (82.3%) had mutations in KCNJ11 (#64) and 89 in ABCC8 (# 56). Successful transfer from insulin to SU was achieved in 91% and 86.5% patients, respectively at a mean age of 36.5 months (0-63 years). Among patients with KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations 64 \u0026 46 were associated with constant success,5 \u0026 5 to constant failure, and 10 and 4 to variable degrees of reported success rate, respectively. The glibenclamide dosage required for each genotype ranged from 0.017 to 2.8 mg / kg / day. Comparing both the in vivo and in vitro susceptibility results, some mutations appear more sensitive than others to sulfonylurea treatment. Side effects were reported in 17 /103 of the included articles: mild gastrointestinal symptoms and hypoglycaemia were the most common. One premature patient had an ulcerative necrotizing enterocolitis which association with SU is difficult to ascertain. CONCLUSIONS Sulfonylurea are an effective treatment for monogenic diabetes due to KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes mutations.

Furthermore, there have been extensive debates over antiviral candidates for their effectiveness and safety against severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that rapid preclinical animal studies are required to identify potential antiviral candidates for human trials. To this end, the antiviral efficacies of lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed in the ferret infection model. While the lopinavir-ritonavir-, hydroxychloroquine sulfate-, or emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group exhibited lower overall clinical scores than the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated control group, the virus titers in nasal washes, stool specimens, and respiratory tissues were similar between all three antiviral-candidate-treated groups and the PBS-treated control group. Only the emtricitabine-tenofovir-treated group showed lower virus titers in nasal washes at 8 days postinfection (dpi) than the PBS-treated control group. To further explore the effect of immune suppression on viral infection and clinical outcome, ferrets were treated with azathioprine, an immunosuppressive drug. Compared to the PBS-treated control group, azathioprine-immunosuppressed ferrets exhibited a longer period of clinical illness, higher virus titers in nasal turbinate, delayed virus clearance, and significantly lower serum neutralization (SN) antibody titers. Taken together, all antiviral drugs tested marginally reduced the overall clinical scores of infected ferrets but did not significantly affect in vivo virus titers. Despite the potential discrepancy of drug efficacies between animals and humans, these preclinical ferret data should be highly informative to future therapeutic treatment of COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to spread worldwide, with rapidly increasing numbers of mortalities, placing increasing strain on health care systems. Despite serious public health concerns, no effective vaccines or therapeutics have been approved by regulatory agencies. In this study, we tested the FDA-approved drugs lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and emtricitabine-tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a highly susceptible ferret infection model. While most of the drug treatments marginally reduced clinical symptoms, they did not reduce virus titers, with the exception of emtricitabine-tenofovir treatment, which led to diminished virus titers in nasal washes at 8 dpi. Further, the azathioprine-treated immunosuppressed ferrets showed delayed virus clearance and low SN titers, resulting in a prolonged infection. As several FDA-approved or repurposed drugs are being tested as antiviral candidates at clinics without sufficient information, rapid preclinical animal studies should proceed to identify therapeutic drug candidates with strong antiviral potential and high safety prior to a human efficacy trial.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Su-Jin; Yu, Kwang-Min; Kim, Young-Il; Kim, Se-Mi; Kim, Eun-Ha; Kim, Seong-Gyu; Kim, Eun Ji; Casel, Mark Anthony B; Rollon, Rare; Jang, Seung-Gyu; Lee, Min-Hyeok; Chang, Jae-Hyung; Song, Min-Suk; Jeong, Hye Won; Choi, Younho; Chen, Weiqiang; Shin, Woo-Jin; Jung, Jae U; Choi, Young Ki","journal":"mBio","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01114-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32444382/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs2ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lower virus titers","antiviral drugs","PBS-treated control group","higher virus titers","diminished virus titers","potential antiviral candidates","emtricitabine-tenofovir","SARS-CoV","treated groups","antibody titers","antiviral-candidate","antiviral efficacies of lopinavir","delayed virus clearance","strong antiviral potential","tenofovir treatment","therapeutic drug candidates","low SN titers","nasal washes","viral infection","prolonged infection","FDA-approved drugs lopinavir-ritonavir","lower overall clinical scores","clinical outcome","clinical symptoms","hydroxychloroquine sulfate","azathioprine-immunosuppressed ferrets","exception of emtricitabine","repurposed drugs","susceptible ferret infection model","overall clinical scores of infected ferrets","nasal turbinate","potential discrepancy of drug efficacies","drug treatments","immunosuppressive drug","preclinical ferret data","future therapeutic treatment of COVID","rapid preclinical animal studies","severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV","longer period of clinical illness","sufficient information","clinics","patients","number of FDA","lower serum neutralization","high safety","respiratory tissues","increasing strain","human trials","increasing numbers of mortalities","health care systems","human efficacy trial","serious public health concerns","effectiveness","animals","stool specimens","phosphate-buffered saline","humans","effective vaccines","therapeutics","effect of immune suppression","coronavirus","disease","days postinfection","IMPORTANCE","urgent need","extensive debates","end","regulatory agencies","pandemic","study"],"language":"en"},

Here we target individuals with high frequency of animal exposure in Vietnam. METHODS A 3-year community-based surveillance was conducted in Vietnam during 2013-2016. We enrolled total of 581 individuals (animal-raising farmers, slaughterers, animal-health workers and rat-traders), and utilized RT-PCR to detect 15 common respiratory viruses in pooled nasal-throat swabs collected at baseline or acute respiratory-disease episodes. RESULTS A respiratory virus was detected in 7.9% (58/732) of baseline samples, and 17.7% (136/770) of disease-episode samples (p\u003C0.001), with enteroviruses, rhinoviruses and influenza A virus being the predominant viruses detected. There were temporal and spatial fluctuations in the frequencies of the detected viruses over the study period, e.g. enteroviruses and influenza A viruses were more often detected during rainy seasons. CONCLUSION We reported the detection of common respiratory viruses in individuals with high frequency of animal exposure in Vietnam, an emerging infectious diseases hotspot. The results show the value of baseline/control sampling in delineating the causative relationships, and have revealed important insights into the ecological aspects of enteroviruses, rhinoviruses and influenza A and their contributions to the burden posed by respiratory infections in Vietnam.

Several operational definitions have been created for sarcopenia screening; however, an international consensus is lacking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recently recognized that sarcopenia detection requires improved diagnosis and screening measures. Mounting evidence hints towards changes in the corticospinal communication system where corticomuscular coherence (CMC) reflects an effective mechanism of corticospinal interaction. CMC can be assessed during locomotion by means of simultaneously measuring Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG). The aim of this study was to perform sarcopenia screening in community-dwelling older adults and explore the possibility of using CMC assessed during gait to discriminate between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves showed high sensitivity, precision and accuracy of CMC assessed from EEG Cz sensor and EMG sensors located over Musculus Vastus Medialis [Cz-VM; AUC (95.0%CI): 0.98 (0.92-1.04), sensitivity: 1.00, 1-specificity: 0.89, p \u003C 0.001] and with Musculus Biceps Femoris [Cz-BF; AUC (95.0%CI): 0.86 (0.68-1.03), sensitivity: 1.00, 1-specificity: 0.70, p \u003C 0.001].

The novelty of this exploratory investigation is the hint toward a novel possible determinant of age-related sarcopenia, derived from corticospinal control of locomotion and shown by the observed large differences in CMC when sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults are compared. This, in turn, might represent in future a potential treatment target to counteract sarcopenia as well as a parameter to monitor the progression of the disease and/or the potential recovery following other treatment interventions.","publish_time":"2020-03-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gennaro, Federico; Maino, Paolo; Kaelin-Lang, Alain; Bock, Katrien De; Bruin, Eling D de","journal":"Journal of clinical medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9030720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32155951/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs3MjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CMC","EEG Cz","EMG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["sarcopenia screening","non-sarcopenic older adults","sarcopenia detection","accuracy of CMC","Disease Control","corticospinal control of locomotion","Cz-BF","Cz-VM","EEG Cz sensor","novel possible determinant of age-related sarcopenia","screening measures","Hedge\u0027s g","AUC","high sensitivity","muscle disease","specificity","observed large differences","corticospinal communication system","potential treatment target","EMG sensors","significant differences","effective mechanism of corticospinal interaction","potential recovery","treatment interventions","large magnitude of effect","Musculus Vastus Medialis","Musculus Biceps Femoris","curves","corticomuscular coherence","hint","ROC","changes","precision","improved diagnosis","Prevention","Characteristic","future","muscles","possibility","gait","community","exploratory investigation","Receiver","ICD","Electroencephalography","Electromyography","Centers","study","Mounting evidence","international consensus","operational definitions","novelty","progression","parameter","classification","aim","turn"],"language":"en"},

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS In this study, we developed a predictive model to estimate the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period among 34 provincial regions in China. Our main assumption was that blood donors of all ages in different regions have a stable blood donation intention and the same infection risk. RESULTS First, we estimated the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, and China, from December 31, 2019 to March 17, 2020. Second, we compared the number of blood donors during the COVID-19 incubation period in all provinces across China. In addition, we found that if all RBCs, plasma, and cryoprecipitation were stored in isolation until the 14th day, the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through blood transfusion was reduced by at least 65.77% after the blood donor safely passed the COVID-19 incubation period. Moreover, if the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was carried out on all platelets, the potential risk would be reduced by 77.48%.

In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, known as COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Many cancer patients frequently visit the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance. They may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anticancer therapy and are at higher risk of developing infections. Several factors increase the risk of infection, and cancer patients commonly have multiple risk factors. Cancer patients appear to have an estimated twofold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. With the WHO declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of such a pandemic on cancer patients. This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic. Currently and due to limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the management of cancer patients in any infectious pandemic.

Objective To evaluate the impact that the use of the masseter nerve in dynamic facial reconstruction has on the electrical activity of the masseter muscle and on bite force. Materials and Methods An observational and prospective longitudinal study was performed measuring bite force and electrical activity of the masseter muscles before and 3 months after dynamic facial reconstructive surgery using the masseter nerve. An occlusal analyzer and surface electromyography were employed for measurements. Results The study included 15 patients with unilateral facial paralysis, with a mean age of 24.06 \u00B1 23.43. Seven patients were subjected to a masseter-buccal branch nerve transfer, whereas in eight patients, the masseter nerve was used as a donor nerve for gracilis free functional muscle transfer. Electrical activity of the masseter muscle was significantly reduced after surgery in both occlusal positions: from 140.86 \u00B1 65.94 to 109.68 \u00B1 68.04 ( p = 0.01) in maximum intercuspation and from 123.68 \u00B1 75.64 to 82.64 \u00B1 66.56 ( p = 0.01) in the rest position.

The main findings are as follows. 1) The outbreak had spread rapidly throughout the country within a short time and the current totality incidence rate has decreased. 2) The spatiotemporal distribution of cases was uneven. In terms of the spatiotemporal clustering pattern, Wuhan and Shiyan city were the center as both cities had high-high clustering pattern with a surrounding unstable multiple type pattern in partial areas of Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, and Chongqing city. Those regions are continuously in the hot spot on the spatiotemporal tendency. 3) The spatiotemporal analysis technology based on the space-time cube can analyze comprehensively the spatiotemporal pattern of epidemiological data and produce a visual output of the consequences, which can reflect intuitively the distribution and trend of data in space-time.

The disease is now termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the early reports, the patients were mainly middle-aged and elderly men, and children appeared to be less susceptible to this infection. With modern and efficient transportation, the disease quickly spread to almost all corners of the world and the mortality far exceeds those caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS). As the number of children with COVID-19 gradually increases, the disease has been documented in premature babies, infants, children and adolescents. Severe and fatal cases in children are relatively rare. The burden of disease in children has been relatively low, but the high proportions of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections in children deserve careful attention.

The aim of this study was to determine the functional impact of elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy performed with high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery for diverticulitis in consecutive male patients. METHODS Twenty-five consecutive patients of median age 53 years were enrolled in a prospective single-centre pilot study at a tertiary teaching hospital. Main outcome measures were functional results. Patients were asked to complete standardized, validated questionnaires to evaluate preoperative and 6 months postoperative bowel symptomatology (Jorge-Wexner Incontinence Score and KESS score), urinary function (IPSS), and sexual function (IIEF). Secondary outcomes were surgical data, morbidity, and quality of life (SF-36). RESULTS There were no significant differences between preoperative and 6 months postoperative total scores for bowel symptomatology, urinary function, and sexual function. There were no perioperative deaths. The morbidity rate was 12% including three minor and no major events. Quality of life demonstrated statistically better general health (p \u003C 0.01) and better medical status over the prior 4 weeks at 6 months after surgery, compared to baseline. This single-centre prospective study has a limited number of patients, relatively short follow-up time, and includes only male patients. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with high tie of the inferior mesenteric artery for diverticular disease does not induce functional disorders at 6 months after surgery. The benefit of the operation for quality of life is even greater for general health and medical status.","publish_time":"2019-12-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jolivet, M; Trilling, B; Sage, P-Y; Boussat, B; Girard, E; Faucheron, J-L","journal":"Techniques in coloproctology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-019-02123-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31820191/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs4ODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["urinary function","consecutive male patients","sexual function","quality of life","months postoperative bowel symptomatology","functional results","limited number of patients","single-centre prospective study","consecutive patients of median age","inferior mesenteric artery","months postoperative total scores","diverticular disease","prospective single-centre pilot study","functional disorders","better general health","better medical status","surgery","functional impact of elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy","CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sigmoidectomy","KESS score","high tie","high ligation","morbidity rate","Jorge-Wexner Incontinence Score","years","diverticulitis","vascular approach","sigmoid colectomy","surgical data","short follow-up time","weeks","IPSS","tertiary teaching hospital","significant differences","consensus","Secondary outcomes","Main outcome measures","METHODS","validated questionnaires","operation","major events","benefit","baseline","IIEF","SF","perioperative deaths","BACKGROUND","aim"],"language":"en"},

Acute diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is critically dependent on detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from clinical specimens (e.g. nasopharyngeal swabs). While laboratory-developed testing for SARS-CoV-2 is an essential component of diagnostic testing for this virus, the majority of clinical microbiology laboratories are dependent on commercially available SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays. In contrast to assays approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for in vitro diagnostic use, assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids have Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. Outside of highly specialized academic and commercial laboratory settings, clinical microbiology laboratories are likely unfamiliar with EUA classification and thus assay verification can be daunting. Further compounding anxiety for laboratories are major issues with supply chain that are dramatically affecting the availability of test reagents and requiring laboratories to implement multiple commercial EUA tests. Here, we describe guidance for the verification of assays with EUA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from clinical specimens.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mitchell, Stephanie L; St George, Kirsten; Rhoads, Daniel D; Butler-Wu, Susan M; Dharmarha, Vaishali; McNult, Peggy; Miller, Melissa B","journal":"Journal of clinical microbiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00796-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32381642/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Food and Drug Administration","FDA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["detection of SARS","available SARS-CoV","clinical specimens","verification of assays","majority of clinical microbiology laboratories","diagnostic use","EUA classification","molecular assays","multiple commercial EUA tests","essential component of diagnostic testing","commercial laboratory settings","area of rapid diagnostic test development","nucleic acids","Emergency Use Authorization","availability of test reagents","major issues","virus","health care","infection","new wave of challenges","RNA","supply chain","Drug Administration","compounding anxiety","implementation","Food","pandemic","nasopharyngeal swabs","Acute diagnosis of COVID","FDA","guidance","contrast"],"language":"en"},

In this paper, we for the first time design and construct an innovative tool to investigate the heterogeneity of large in-situ samples. The most key component, array coil, which performs with azimuthal selection, measurement consistency and interactive isolation, configured in this novel tool to capture heterogeneity information. Whereas, strong coupling between neighboring coil elements largely decrease the coil sensitivity. Capacitive decoupling network is bridged into adjacent ports without segmenting coils to be decoupled and could be easily adjusted by electrical relays. The coil model and numerical simulation are firstly given to demonstrate the array coil configuration, B1 field map and mutual coupling effects on coil sensitivity. Capacitive network is then introduced to be theoretically and practically analyzed to minimize coupling effects. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that these coil elements have excellent consistency and independence to feasibly acquire the azimuthal NMR data.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Luo, Sihui; Xiao, Lizhi; Zong, Fangrong; Li, Xin; Liao, Guangzhi; Shi, Guuanghui; Men, Baiyong; Zhang, Xiang; Wang, Zhengduo; Sun, Zhe; Deng, Feng","journal":"Journal of magnetic resonance","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmr.2020.106735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408240/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs5MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["coil sensitivity","coil model","azimuthal information","neighboring coil elements","array coil configuration","azimuthal selection","azimuthal orientations","azimuthal NMR data","azimuthal spatial heterogeneity","heterogeneity information","NMR measurement","heterogeneity of large","mutual coupling effects","measurement consistency","strong coupling","situ objects","Capacitive network","location information of oil","Capacitive decoupling network","novel tool","different properties","pore structure","innovative tool","fluids properties","excellent consistency","situ samples","numerical simulation","B1 field map","interactive isolation","independence","adjacent ports","tools","unique technique","experimental results","time design","nuclear magnetic resonance","segmenting coils","gas","borehole","key component","ambiguous evaluations","electrical relays","paper"],"language":"en"},

The temporal pattern of opioid prescribing in the context of the opioid epidemic remains unknown. Objective To examine the temporal pattern of opioid prescribing within an ED for varying pain conditions between 2009 and 2018. Design, Setting, and Participants A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted at the ED of an urban academic medical center. All patients treated within that ED between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, were included. Main Outcomes and Measures The proportion of patients prescribed an opioid for treatment of pain in the ED temporally by condition, condition type, patient demographics, and physician prescriber. Results Between 2009 and 2018, 556 176 patient encounters took place in the ED, with 70 218 unique opioid prescriptions ordered. A total of 316 632 patients (55.9%) were female, 45 070 (42.6%) were of white race, and 43 412 (40.6%) were privately insured; the median age group was 41 to 45 years. Yearly opioid prescriptions decreased by 66.3% (from 16.3 to 5.5 opioids per 100 encounters) between 2013 and 2018, with a yearly adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.808 (95% CI, 0.802-0.814) compared with the prior year. In patients with musculoskeletal pain (back, joint, limb, and neck pain), opioid prescribing decreased by 71.1% (from 36.7 to 10.6 opioids per 100 encounters between 2013 and 2018; aOR, 0.758; 95% CI, 0.744-0.773). In patients with musculoskeletal trauma (fracture, sprain, contusion, and injury), opioid prescribing decreased by 58.0% (from 34.2 to 14.8 opioids per 100 encounters; aOR, 0.811; 95% CI, 0.797-0.824). In patients with nonmusculoskeletal pain (abdominal pain, kidney stone, respiratory distress, and pharyngitis) opioid prescribing decreased by 53.7% (from 20.1 to 9.3 opioids per 100 encounters; aOR, 0.850; 95% CI, 0.834-0.868). Between 2009 and 2018, patients who were black (aOR, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.741-0.779) and those who were Asian (aOR, 0.714; 95% CI, 0.665-0.764) had the lowest odds of receiving an opioid compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions and Relevance There was a substantial temporal decrease in the number of opioid prescriptions within this ED during the study period. This decrease was associated with substantial relative reductions in opioid prescribing for treatment of musculoskeletal pain compared with fractures and kidney stones.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Ben C; Vigotsky, Andrew D; Apkarian, A Vania; Schnitzer, Thomas J","journal":"JAMA network open","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.0802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32211867/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1MDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ED"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["opioid epidemic","number of opioid prescriptions","Importance Opioid prescriptions","unique opioid prescriptions","temporal pattern of opioid prescribing","aOR","treatment of pain","long-term opioid use","treatment of musculoskeletal pain","abdominal pain","neck pain","nonmusculoskeletal pain","proportion of patients","opioids","patient encounters","varying pain conditions","substantial temporal decrease","musculoskeletal trauma","condition type","patient demographics","kidney stones","cross-sectional study","yearly adjusted odds ratio","study period","lowest odds","substantial relative reductions","respiratory distress","context","sprain","contusion","pharyngitis","EDs","fractures","emergency departments","Participants","population","urban academic medical center","Relevance","limb","injury","median age group","physician prescriber","Setting","place","Main Outcomes","ethnic groups","Design","years","Conclusions","Objective","Results","white race","prior year","total","female"],"language":"en"},

By describing the life cycle of the newly emergent coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in light of emerging data on the therapeutic efficacy of various repurposed antimicrobials undergoing testing against the virus, we highlight in this review a possible mechanistic convergence between some of these tested compounds. Specifically, we propose that the lysosomotropic effects of hydroxychloroquine and several other drugs undergoing testing may be responsible for their demonstrated in vitro antiviral activities against COVID-19. Moreover, we propose that Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a lysosomal storage disorder, may provide new insights into potential future therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2, by highlighting key established features of the disorder that together result in an \u0022unfavorable\u0022 host cellular environment that may interfere with viral propagation. Our reasoning evolves from previous biochemical and cell biology findings related to NPC, coupled with the rapidly evolving data on COVID-19. Our overall aim is to suggest that pharmacological interventions targeting lysosomal function in general, and those particularly capable of reversibly inducing transient NPC-like cellular and biochemical phenotypes, constitute plausible mechanisms that could be used to therapeutically target COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ballout, Rami A; Sviridov, Dmitri; Bukrinsky, Michael I; Remaley, Alan T","journal":"FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202000654r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32367579/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1MTg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["COVID","transient NPC","testing","SARS-CoV","lysosomal storage disorder","biochemical phenotypes","lysosomal function","efficacious drugs","evolving data","host cellular environment","light of emerging data","potential future therapeutic targets","therapeutic efficacy of various repurposed antimicrobials","new insights","race","pharmacological interventions","cell biology findings","fastest available option","Niemann-Pick disease type C","emergent coronavirus","possible mechanistic convergence","review","antiviral activities","Drug repurposing","plausible mechanisms","key established features","life cycle","lysosomotropic effects of hydroxychloroquine","reasoning","tested compounds","overall aim","viral propagation"],"language":"en"},

For eukaryotic membranes, for instance, rather than using only zwitterionic phospholipids there is now a trend to employ mixtures to simulate the lipid rafts known to be relevant for various cellular processes. In this study, we demonstrate that effects from chitosans on Langmuir monolayers are considerably higher if lipid raft compositions (ternary mixtures of dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC), sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol) are used. Significantly, measurable effects on the surface pressure isotherms start at 10-6 mg mL-1 for chitosans in lipid rafts, to be compared with 10-2 mg mL-1 for neat dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). This applies to both a commercial chitosan and chitosans soluble at physiological pH. Incorporation of these chitosans in the raft monolayers was confirmed in polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) experiments, where both the tail groups and headgroups were found to interact with chitosan. Since the effects on membrane models may be observed at such small concentrations for chitosans and probably other molecules, some studies may have to be revisited where neat phospholipids should be replaced by lipid raft compositions.","publish_time":"2020-05-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pereira, Andressa R; Fiamingo, Anderson; de O Pedro, Rafael; Campana-Filho, S\u00E9rgio P; Miranda, Paulo B; Oliveira, Osvaldo N","journal":"Colloids and surfaces.

Social distancing measures, travel bans, self-quarantines, and business closures are changing the very fabric of societies worldwide. With people forced out of public spaces, much conversation about these phenomena now occurs online, e.g., on social media platforms like Twitter. OBJECTIVE In this paper, we describe a multilingual coronavirus (COVID-19) Twitter dataset that we are making available to the research community via our COVID-19-TweetIDs Github repository. METHODS We started this ongoing data collection on January 28, 2020, leveraging Twitter\u0027s Streaming API and Tweepy to follow certain keywords and accounts that were trending at the time the collection began, and used Twitter\u0027s Search API to query for past tweets, resulting in the earliest tweets in our collection dating back to January 21, 2020. RESULTS Since the inception of our collection, we have actively maintained and updated our Github repository on a weekly basis. We have published over 123 million tweets, with over 60% of the tweets in English. This manuscript also presents basic analysis that shows that Twitter activity responds and reacts to coronavirus-related events. CONCLUSIONS It is our hope that our contribution will enable the study of online conversation dynamics in the context of a planetary-scale epidemic outbreak of unprecedented proportions and implications. This dataset could also help track scientific coronavirus misinformation and unverified rumors or enable the understanding of fear and panic - and undoubtedly more.

METHODS Consecutive patients with obstructed defecation symptoms (ODS) associated with rectocele who had the TRREMS procedure were included. Each patient was assessed by echodefecography, manometry, and colonic transit time as well as the Cleveland Clinic constipation score (CCS) before therapy and at follow-up after 6 months. Reduction in the CCS score was calculated as a ratio. Factors correlated with a decrease in the CCS were analyzed in a univariate analysis. RESULTS A total of 81 patients were included. Nineteen patients had postoperative complications that were not severe: 7 (8.6%) had tenesmus, 6 (7.4%) stenosis (4 treated with digital dilatation and 2 with endoscopic stricturectomy), 4 (4.9%) residual mucosal prolapse treated with rubber band ligation, 1 (1.2%) early bleeding, and 1(1.2%) thrombosis. Seventy-nine (97.5%) patients had a significant clinical response with significant reduction of the CCS constipation score from median 13 (range 17-10) to 4 (range, 8-2) (p = 0.0001); only 2 patients (2.5%) had an unsatisfactory response, complaining of straining and vaginal digitation during the evacuatory effort. Patients with anismus previously treated with biofeedback had a lower reduction ratio of the CCS score compared with patients without anismus (61.2 \u00B1 2.8% versus 70.9% \u00B1 1.5, p = 0.0006). There were no significant differences in the reduction of the CCS according to age, parity, type of delivery, previous hysterectomy, post-menopausal status, rectal mucosal prolapse and/or associated rectal intussusception, grade of rectocele and presence of complications. CONCLUSIONS The TRREMS procedure significantly improved evacuation disorders in this study. Appropriate selection of patients is key for the success of this approach. Anismus even if previously treated with biofeedback, was the main predictive factor of unsuccessful treatment.","publish_time":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Regadas, F S P; Murad-Regadas, S M; Rodrigues, L V; Regadas Filho, F S P; Vilarinho, A S; Morano, D P","journal":"Techniques in coloproctology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-019-02131-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31828573/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs1NzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cleveland Clinic","CCS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CCS score","CCS constipation score","significant reduction","METHODS Consecutive patients","Appropriate selection of patients","anismus","grade of rectocele","TRREMS procedure","lower reduction ratio","rectal mucosectomy","Cleveland Clinic constipation score","rectal intussusception","transanal repair of rectocele","treatment of obstructed defecation","significant clinical response","biofeedback","significant differences","predictive factors","study","unsuccessful results","range","obstructed defecation symptoms","main predictive factor of unsuccessful treatment","unsatisfactory response","presence of complications","postoperative complications","previous hysterectomy","post-menopausal status","type of delivery","improved evacuation disorders","single circular stapler","manometry","straining","parity","key","age","therapy","colonic transit time","vaginal digitation","digital dilatation","echodefecography","CONCLUSIONS","impact","rubber band ligation","evacuatory effort","endoscopic stricturectomy","follow-up","stenosis","approach","months","BACKGROUND","aim","univariate analysis","decrease","early bleeding","total","tenesmus","thrombosis"],"language":"en"},

However, Th cell polarization in viral- or bacterial-mediated ALI is not well defined. Herein, an influenza virus (A/FM/1/47, H1N1) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were chosen to induce ALI in mice, and the resultant diversity of Th-cell polarization was explored. METHODOLOGY BALB/c mice were challenged intranasally with the influenza virus or LPS. Edema of the lung, infiltration of inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes), oxidative stress, and signature cytokines of Th1 and Th2 cells were detected at 2 days post virus or LPS challenge. RESULTS The mice exhibited increased capillary permeability accompanied by lung edema and protein-rich alveolar exudation after virus or LPS challenge. Additionally, excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells, robust oxidative stress, and cytokine production were observed in both mouse groups. However, there was conspicuous disparity in the inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokines between the virus- and LPS-challenged mice, where the infiltration in virus-challenged mice was mainly of macrophages and accompanied by robust Th1 cytokine elevation, whereas the infiltration in LPS-challenged mice was primarily of neutrophils and accompanied by robust Th2 cytokine elevation. CONCLUSIONS The Th cell polarization was skewed depending on whether ALI was induced by the influenza virus or LPS. The polarization in the virus-challenged mice was primarily toward a Th1 response, whereas that in the LPS-challenged mice was mainly toward Th2.","publish_time":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liu, Jian-Xing; Zhang, Ying; An, Miao; Wu, Qing-Guang; Zhao, Ya; Li, Xiong; Li, Geng","journal":"Journal of infection in developing countries","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.10338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32058989/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["influenza virus","LPS challenge","c mice","inflammatory cell infiltration","Th cell polarization","excessive infiltration of inflammatory cells","Th2 cells","days post virus","inflammatory response","robust Th1 cytokine elevation","robust Th2 cytokine elevation","lung edema","Th1 response","robust oxidative stress","polarization of T helper","cytokine production","signature cytokines of Th1","resultant diversity of Th","neutrophils","macrophages","bacterial-mediated ALI","tissue damage processes of infectious acute lung injury","protein-rich alveolar exudation","pathogen removal","important role","increased capillary permeability","lymphocytes","conspicuous disparity","INTRODUCTION","H1N1","METHODOLOGY BALB","FM","CONCLUSIONS","mouse groups","lipopolysaccharide"],"language":"en"},

Since cellular dormancy is one strategy for surviving, and since chemokines determine the environmental conditions in which dormancy occurs, we investigated how chemokines affect temozolomide (TMZ)-promoted cellular dormancy entry and exit in GBM cells. TMZ administration over ten days promoted cellular dormancy entry, whereas discontinuing TMZ for a further 15 days resulted in resumption of proliferation. Co-administration of a chemokine cocktail containing CXCL12, CXCL16, and CX3CL1 resulted in both delayed entry and exit from cellular dormancy. A microarray-based transcriptome analysis in LN229 GBM cells revealed that cellular dormancy entry was characterized by an increased expression of CCL2 and SAA2, while THSD4, FSTL3, and VEGFC were upregulated during dormancy exit. Co-stimulation with the chemokine cocktail reduced upregulation of identified genes. After verifying the appearance of identified genes in human GBM primary cultures and ex vivo samples, we clarified whether each chemokine alone impacts cellular dormancy mechanisms using specific antagonists and selective CRISPR/Cas9 clones. While expression of CCL2 and SAA2 in LN229 cells was altered by the CXCL12-CXCR4-CXCR7 axis, CXCL16 and CX3CL1 contributed to reduced upregulation of THSD4 and, to a weaker extent, of VEGFC. The influence on FSTL3 expression depended on the entire chemokine cocktail. Effects of chemokines on dormancy entry and exit-associated genes were detectable in human GBM primary cells, too, even if in a more complex, cell-specific manner. Thus, chemokines play a significant role in the regulation of TMZ-promoted cellular dormancy in GBMs.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adamski, Vivian; Hattermann, Kirsten; Kubelt, Carolin; Cohrs, Gesa; Lucius, Ralph; Synowitz, Michael; Sebens, Susanne; Held-Feindt, Janka","journal":"Oncogene","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-020-1302-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346064/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TMZ"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cellular dormancy entry","dormancy exit","cellular dormancy mechanisms","LN229 GBM cells","human GBM primary cells","LN229 cells","delayed entry","TMZ administration","chemokine cocktail reduced upregulation of identified genes","entire chemokine cocktail","exit-associated genes","human GBM primary cultures","regulation of TMZ","discontinuing TMZ","FSTL3 expression","Effects of chemokines","appearance of identified genes","CX3CL1","CXCL16","reduced upregulation of THSD4","SAA2","days","increased expression of CCL2","Co-administration","VEGFC","specific antagonists","CXCL12-CXCR4","Co-stimulation","cell-specific manner","selective CRISPR","microarray-based transcriptome analysis","malignant brain tumor","CXCR7 axis","samples","Cas9 clones","therapy regimens","significant role","strategy","surviving","weaker extent","environmental conditions","temozolomide","GBMs","Glioblastoma multiforme","resumption of proliferation","influence"],"language":"en"},

Most trauma-related research originates from trauma centres, and there are limited available data regarding the treatment of trauma patients throughout the Nordic countries. These countries differ from economically similar countries due to their cold climate, mix of rural and urban areas, and the long distances separating many residents from a trauma centre. Research funders and the general public expect trauma research to focus on all links in the treatment chain. Here we conducted a systematic review to assess the amount of trauma-related research from the Nordic countries between January 1995 and April 2018, and the distribution of this research among different countries and different parts of the trauma treatment chain. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus. We included studies concerning the trauma population from Nordic countries, and published between January 1995 and April 2018. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts, and performed data extraction from full-text articles. RESULTS The literature search yielded 5117 titles and abstracts, of which 844 full-text articles were included in our analysis. During this period, the annual number of publications increased. Publications were equally distributed among Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in terms of numbers; however, Norway had more publications relative to inhabitants. There were fewer overall publications from Finland and Iceland. We identified mostly cohort studies and very few randomized controlled trials. Studies focused on the level of care were predominantly epidemiological studies. Research at the pre-hospital level was three-fold more frequent than research on other elements of the trauma treatment chain. CONCLUSION The rate of publications in the field of trauma care in the Nordic countries has increased over recent years. However, several parts of the trauma treatment chain are still unexplored and most of the available studies are observational studies with low research evidence.","publish_time":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jeppesen, Elisabeth; Iversen, Valdemar Vea; Hansen, Ingrid Schr\u00F8der; Reierth, Eirik; Wisborg, Torben","journal":"Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13049-020-0703-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32164776/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs3NjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Finland","Iceland"],"keyphrases":["trauma research","trauma-related research","trauma treatment chain","trauma centres","trauma population","BACKGROUND Trauma","treatment of trauma patients","Nordic countries","field of trauma care","different countries","Research funders","available studies","similar countries","observational studies","cohort studies","epidemiological studies","low research evidence","rate of publications","publications relative","fewer overall publications","annual number of publications","different parts","available data","level of care","Norway","abstracts","titles","systematic literature search","text articles","data extraction","systematic review","pre-hospital level","major cause of mortality","Medline","Cochrane Library","Embase","fold","general public","elements","Web of Science","urban areas","long distances","cold climate","reduced quality of life","Denmark","Finland","Iceland","residents","links","randomized controlled trials","terms of numbers","Sweden","independent reviewers","period","METHODS","inhabitants","recent years","distribution","Scopus","analysis","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

Given the paucity of robust clinical trial data for most COVID-19 pharmacotherapies at this time, clinicians should continue to remain steadfast in recognition of interventions that improve clinical outcomes and vigilant in monitoring for acute adverse effects that are difficult to detect in clinical trials with small sample sizes. The observations from our two cases highlight the complex, not fully elucidated interrelationship between elevated IL-6 and pharmacologic interventions impacting this pathway. Clinicians should consider monitoring for hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis as described with chronic tocilizumab use for rheumatoid arthritis in those receiving it for COVID-19.

How we can re-design the concept of Public Health in relation to the built environment and the contemporary cities? METHODS According to the previous statements and scenario, aim of this paper is to integrate the Urban Health strategic objectives, focusing the possible responses, both immediate and medium-long term, to the current environmental, social, and economic aspects of the \u0022period\u0022 of physical distancing. Results. Immediate Actions are 01. program the flexibility of city schedules; 02. plan a smart and sustainable mobility network; 03. define a neighborhood services\u0027 plan; 04. develop a digitization of the urban context, promoting the smart communities; 05. re-think the accessibility to the places of culture and tourism. Medium-long term Actions are 06. design the indoor flexibility of domestic living spaces; 07. re-think building typologies, fostering the presence of semi-private or collective spaces; 08. renovate the basic care services\u0027 network; 09. integrate the existing environmental emergency plans, with those related to the health emergencies; 10. improve stakeholders\u0027 awareness of the factors affecting Public Health in the cities. CONCLUSIONS The Decalogue of Public Health opportunities may provide a useful basis for Designers (Architects and Urban Planners), Policy Makers, Public Health experts and Local Health Agencies, in promoting actions and policies aimed to transform our cities in healthier and Salutogenic living environments.

It is largely unknown what ML applications are available for LMICs that can support and advance clinical medicine and public health. We aim to address this gap by conducting a scoping review of health-related ML applications in LMICs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review will follow the methodology proposed by Levac et al. The search strategy is informed by recent systematic reviews of ML health-related applications. We will search Embase, Medline and Global Health (through Ovid), Cochrane and Google Scholar; we will present the date of our searches in the final review. Titles and abstracts will be screened by two reviewers independently; selected reports will be studied by two reviewers independently. Reports will be included if they are primary research where data have been analysed, ML techniques have been used on data from LMICs and they aimed to improve health-related outcomes. We will synthesise the information following evidence mapping recommendations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The review will provide a comprehensive list of health-related ML applications in LMICs. The results will be disseminated through scientific publications.

Social media is one form of digital health that is available for diabetes self-care, although its use for peer-to-peer communication has not been systematically described, and its potential to support patient self-care is unclear. OBJECTIVE The primary aim of this systematic review was to describe the use of social media among patients (peer-to-peer) to manage diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The secondary aim was to assess patients\u0027 clinical outcomes, behavioral outcomes, quality of life, and self-efficacy resulting from peer-to-peer social media use. METHODS We conducted a literature search in the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO (January 2008 through April 2019). The inclusion criteria were quantitative studies that included peer-to-peer use of social media for self-care of diabetes mellitus (with all subtypes) and CVD, including stroke. RESULTS After an initial yield of 3066 citations, we selected 91 articles for a full-text review and identified 7 papers that met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 4 studies focused on type 1 diabetes, 1 study included both type 1 and 2 diabetes, and 2 studies included multiple chronic conditions (eg, CVD, diabetes, depression, etc). Our search did not yield any individual studies on CVD alone. Among the selected papers, 2 studies used commercial platforms (Facebook and I Seek You), 3 studies used discussion forums developed specifically for each study, and 2 surveyed patients through different platforms or blogs. There was significant heterogeneity in the study designs, methodologies, and outcomes applied, but all studies showed favorable results on either primary or secondary outcomes. The quality of studies was highly variable. CONCLUSIONS The future landscape of social media use for patient self-care is promising. However, current use is nascent. Our extensive search yielded only 7 studies, all of which included diabetes, indicating the most interest and demand for peer-to-peer interaction on diabetes self-care. Future research is needed to establish efficacy and safety in recommending social media use among peers for diabetes self-care and other conditions.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Elnaggar, Abdelaziz; Ta Park, Van; Lee, Sei J; Bender, Melinda; Siegmund, Lee Anne; Park, Linda G","journal":"Journal of medical Internet research","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/14209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329745/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs4Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CVD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["diabetes self-care","peer social media use","peer use of social media","self-care of diabetes mellitus","peer interaction","peer communication","quality of studies","patient self-care","quantitative studies","individual studies","future landscape of social media use","current use","CVD","secondary outcomes","behavioral outcomes","patients\u0027 clinical outcomes","study designs","primary aim","secondary aim","literature search","extensive search","selected papers","inclusion criteria","BACKGROUND Patient engagement","surveyed patients","quality of life","commercial platforms","self-efficacy","different platforms","systematic review","favorable results","text review","Future research","initial yield","multiple chronic conditions","EMBASE","PubMed","following databases","peers","form of digital health","Web of Science","CINAHL","blogs","methodologies","subtypes","morbidity","CONCLUSIONS","safety","significant heterogeneity","cardiovascular disease","citations","articles","OBJECTIVE","Facebook","potential","discussion forums","PsycINFO","mortality","METHODS","stroke","depression","demand"],"language":"en"},

Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine \u00B1 azithromycin for the treatment of COVID-19. Use of these medications alone, or in combination, can lead to a prolongation of the QT interval, possibly increasing the risk of Torsade de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death. Methods - Hospitalized patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine \u00B1 azithromycin from March 1st through the 23rd at three hospitals within the Northwell Health system were included in this prospective, observational study. Serial assessments of the QT interval were performed. The primary outcome was QT prolongation resulting in TdP. Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation, the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to QT prolongation and arrhythmogenic death. Results - Two hundred one patients were treated for COVID-19 with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Ten patients (5.0%) received chloroquine, 191 (95.0%) received hydroxychloroquine and 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin. The primary outcome of TdP was not observed in the entire population. Baseline QTc intervals did not differ between patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (monotherapy group) vs. those treated with combination group (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin) (440.6 \u00B1 24.9 ms vs. 439.9 \u00B1 24.7 ms, p =0.834). The maximum QTc during treatment was significantly longer in the combination group vs the monotherapy group (470.4 \u00B1 45.0 ms vs. 453.3 \u00B1 37.0 ms, p = 0.004). Seven patients (3.5%) required discontinuation of these medications due to QTc prolongation. No arrhythmogenic deaths were reported. Conclusions - In the largest reported cohort of COVID-19 patients to date treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine {plus minus} azithromycin, no instances of TdP or arrhythmogenic death were reported. Although use of these medications resulted in QT prolongation, clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy. Further study of the need for QT interval monitoring is needed before final recommendations can be made.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Saleh, Moussa; Gabriels, James; Chang, David; Kim, Beom Soo; Mansoor, Amtul; Mahmood, Eitezaz; Makker, Parth; Ismail, Haisam; Goldner, Bruce; Willner, Jonathan; Beldner, Stuart; Mitra, Raman; John, Roy; Chinitz, Jason; Skipitaris, Nicholas; Mountantonakis, Stavros; Epstein, Laurence M","journal":"Circulation.

METHODS The records of 12 patients who experienced thyroid nodule rupture after RFA at four Korean thyroid centers between March 2010 and July 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data evaluated included baseline patient characteristics, treatment methods, initial presenting symptoms, imaging features, treatment, and prognosis. RESULTS The most common symptoms of post-RFA nodule rupture were sudden neck bulging and pain. Based on imaging features, the localization of nodule rupture was classified into three types: anterior, posterolateral, and medial types. The anterior type is the most often, followed by posterolateral and medial type. Eight patients recovered completely after conservative treatment. Four patients who did not improve with conservative management required invasive procedures, including incision and drainage or aspiration. CONCLUSION Thyroid nodule rupture after RFA can be classified into three types based on its localization: anterior, posterolateral, and medial types. Because majority of thyroid nodule ruptures after RFA can be managed conservatively, familiarity with these imaging features is essential in avoiding unnecessary imaging workup or invasive procedures.","publish_time":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Chung, Sae Rom; Baek, Jung Hwan; Sung, Jin Yong; Ryu, Ji Hwa; Jung, So Lyung","journal":"Endocrinology and metabolism","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3803/enm.2019.34.4.415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31884742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["imaging features","localization of nodule rupture","CONCLUSION Thyroid nodule rupture","medial types","common symptoms of post-RFA nodule rupture","majority of thyroid nodule ruptures","prognosis of patients","treatment methods","conservative treatment","anterior type","unnecessary imaging workup","Korean thyroid centers","invasive procedures","Clinical data","clinical manifestations","conservative management","initial presenting symptoms","included baseline patient characteristics","sudden neck","radiofrequency ablation","incision","drainage","familiarity","pain","records","aspiration","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The spectrum of acute neurological dysfunctions may implicate direct viral invasion, para-infectious complications, neurological manifestations of systemic diseases, or co-incident neurological dysfunction in the context of high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. A rapid and pragmatic approach to understanding the prevalence, phenotypes, pathophysiology and prognostic implications of COVID-19 neurological syndromes is urgently needed. METHODS The Global Consortium to Study Neurological dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID), endorsed by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS), was rapidly established to address this need in a tiered approach. Tier-1 consists of focused, pragmatic, low-cost, observational common data element (CDE) collection, which can be launched immediately at many sites in the first phase of this pandemic and is designed for expedited ethical board review with waiver-of-consent. Tier 2 consists of prospective functional and cognitive outcomes assessments with more detailed clinical, laboratory and radiographic data collection that would require informed consent. Tier 3 overlays Tiers 1 and 2 with experimental molecular, electrophysiology, pathology and imaging studies with longitudinal outcomes assessment and would require centers with specific resources. A multicenter pediatrics core has developed and launched a parallel study focusing on patients ages \u003C18 years. Study sites are eligible for participation if they provide clinical care to COVID-19 patients and are able to conduct patient-oriented research under approval of an internal or global ethics committee. Hospitalized pediatric and adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 and with acute neurological signs or symptoms are eligible to participate. The primary study outcome is the overall prevalence of neurological complications among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which will be calculated by pooled estimates of each neurological finding divided by the average census of COVID-19 positive patients over the study period. Secondary outcomes include: in-hospital, 30 and 90-day morality, discharge modified Rankin score, ventilator-free survival, ventilator days, discharge disposition, and hospital length of stay. RESULTS In a one-month period (3/27/20-4/27/20) the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium was able to recruit 71 adult study sites, representing 17 countries and 5 continents and 34 pediatrics study sites. CONCLUSIONS This is one of the first large-scale global research collaboratives urgently assembled to evaluate acute neurological events in the context of a pandemic. The innovative and pragmatic tiered study approach has allowed for rapid recruitment and activation of numerous sites across the world-an approach essential to capture real-time critical neurological data to inform treatment strategies in this pandemic crisis.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Frontera, Jennifer; Mainali, Shraddha; Fink, Ericka L; Robertson, Courtney L; Schober, Michelle; Ziai, Wendy; Menon, David; Kochanek, Patrick M; Suarez, Jose I; Helbok, Raimund; McNett, Molly; Chou, Sherry H-Y","journal":"Neurocritical care","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12028-020-00995-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445105/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Neurocritical Care Society"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neurological finding","neurological syndromes","acute neurological signs","acute neurological events","adult study sites","pediatrics study sites","study period","reports of neurological dysfunctions","parallel study","overall prevalence of neurological complications","spectrum of acute neurological dysfunctions","pragmatic tiered study approach","real-time critical neurological data","hospitalized COVID","co-incident neurological dysfunction","neurological manifestations of systemic diseases","pragmatic approach","adult patients","primary study outcome","positive patients","patients ages","tiered approach","prognostic implications of COVID","average census of COVID","approach essential","Global Consortium","pandemic crisis","activation of numerous sites","radiographic data collection","clinical care","Secondary outcomes","GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium","context of high SARS-CoV","large-scale global research collaboratives","cognitive outcomes assessments","longitudinal outcomes assessment","global ethics committee","ventilator days","observational common data element","discharge disposition","rapid recruitment","informed consent","month period","para-infectious complications","ventilator-free survival","patient-oriented research","hospital length of stay","Neurocritical Care Society","multicenter pediatrics core","direct viral invasion","pathology","Rankin score","imaging studies","treatment strategies","approval","laboratory","electrophysiology","waiver","centers","CDE","phenotypes","pathophysiology","world","expedited ethical board review","countries","participation","day morality","peripheral nervous systems","symptoms","continents","overlays Tiers","NCS","pooled estimates","METHODS","specific resources","RESULTS","years","need","phase","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Barriers to clinical engagement typically result from funding constraints causing limited access to and flexibility in services. Digital strategies, such as SMS text messaging, offer a low-cost alternative to potentially improve engagement. However, little is known about the efficacy of SMS text messaging in psychosis. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to address this gap, providing insights into the relationship between SMS text messaging and clinical engagement in the treatment of psychosis. METHODS Studies examining SMS text messaging as an engagement strategy in the treatment of psychosis were reviewed. Included studies were published from the year 2000 onward in the English language, with no methodological restrictions, and were identified using 3 core databases and gray literature sources. RESULTS Of the 233 studies extracted, 15 were eligible for inclusion. Most studies demonstrated the positive effects of SMS text messaging on dimensions of engagement such as medication adherence, clinic attendance, and therapeutic alliance. Studies examining the feasibility of SMS text messaging interventions found that they are safe, easy to use, and positively received. CONCLUSIONS Overall, SMS text messaging is a low-cost, practical method of improving engagement in the treatment of psychosis, although efficacy may vary by symptomology and personal characteristics. Cost-effectiveness and safety considerations were not adequately examined in the studies included. Future studies should consider personalizing SMS text messaging interventions and include cost and safety analyses to appraise readiness for implementation.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"D\u0027Arcey, Jessica; Collaton, Joanna; Kozloff, Nicole; Voineskos, Aristotle N; Kidd, Sean A; Foussias, George","journal":"JMIR mental health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.2196/16993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32238334/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Digital"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["efficacy of SMS text messaging","personalizing SMS text messaging interventions","feasibility of SMS text messaging interventions","positive effects of SMS text messaging","clinical engagement","treatment of psychosis","Future studies","METHODS Studies","dimensions of engagement","engagement strategy","clinical treatment","low-cost alternative","safety analyses","safety considerations","disproportionate risk","relationship","clinic attendance","medication adherence","funding constraints","limited access","premature disengagement","practical method","English language","core databases","gray literature sources","flexibility","readiness","insights","therapeutic alliance","Digital strategies","methodological restrictions","services","gap","symptomology","implementation","year","CONCLUSIONS","personal characteristics","BACKGROUND Individuals","review","Cost-effectiveness","Barriers","OBJECTIVE","inclusion","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19 has not been fully studied. OBJECTIVE To describe thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19. METHODS For each of 1476 consecutive patients with COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China, nadir platelet count during hospitalization was retrospectively collected and categorized into (0, 50], (50, 100], (100 - 150] or (150 - ) group after taking the unit (\u00D7 109/L ) away from the report of nadir platelet count. Nadir platelet counts and in-hospital mortality were analyzed. RESULTS Among all patients, 238 (16.1%) patients deceased and 306 (20.7%) had thrombocytopenia. Compared with survivors, non-survivors were older, were more likely to have thrombocytopenia and had lower nadir platelet counts. The in-hospital mortality was 92.1%, 61.2%, 17.5% and 4.7% for (0, 50], (50, 100], (100 - 150] and (150 - ) group, respectively.

The combination of intraperitoneal and systemic chemotherapy seems rational, and the aim of this systematic review was to compare PIPAC directed monotherapy with a bidirectional treatment approach (PIPAC in combination with systemic chemotherapy). Main outcomes were survival and quality of life. METHODS A systematic literature search in Medline, Embase, Cochrane and the \u0022Pleura and Peritoneum\u0022 was conducted and analyzed according to PRISMA guidelines. Studies in English reporting on bidirectional treatment with PIPAC and systemic chemotherapy and published before April 2019 were included. RESULTS Twelve studies with a total of 386 patients were included. None were specifically designed to compare mono- versus bidirectional treatment, but 44% of the patients received bidirectional treatment. This was more frequent in women (non-gynecological cancers) and one-third of the bidirectional treated patients had received no prior chemotherapy. Data from the included studies provided no conclusions regarding survival or quality of life. CONCLUSION Bidirectional treatment with PIPAC and systemic chemotherapy is practised and feasible, and some patients are enrolled having received no prior systemic chemotherapy for their PM.

Stable primary tumor status (hazard ratio [HR] 0.497, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.321-0.769, p = 0.002) and KPS score \u226590 (HR 1.407, 95% CI 1.018-1.946, p = 0.039) significantly predicted longer overall survival. The PIBM showed the lowest Akaike information criterion value and the highest integrated area under the curve value compared with other prognostic indices. CONCLUSIONS The PIBM may be a more accurate prognostic indicator than other published indices. Although this new and practical prognostic index requires further validation in larger cohort studies, we suggest that the PIBM could be useful to predict survival time and inform appropriate management of patients with brain metastases.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, Sang Ryul; Roh, Tae Hoon; Jeong, Dong Hwan; You, Namkyu; Jang, Ae Hwa; Seo, Mi Ra; Choung, Jin Hee; Park, Bumhee; Kim, Se-Hyuk","journal":"Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1159/000507338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408303/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxNjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["KPS","PIBM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["prognostic indices","PIBM","practical prognostic index","new prognostic index","prognostic factors","prognostic ability","median overall survival time","prediction of survival time","brain metastases","accurate prognostic indicator","months","time of treatment","KPS score","survival analysis","range","published indices","Stable primary tumor status","median Karnofsky performance status","appropriate management of patients","HR","years","CI","median follow-up duration","curve value","radiosurgical treatment","practical scoring system","lowest Akaike information criterion value","highest integrated area","hazard ratio","validation","Gamma Knife radiosurgery","larger cohort studies","single institute","groups","confidence interval","RESULTS","data","study","mean age","METHODS","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic response of patients with different EGFR exon 19dels to first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the mechanisms by which their tumors acquire resistance to these TKIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS The clinical outcomes of 195 patients harboring EGFR exon 19dels and receiving first-generation EGFR TKIs between July 2011 and June 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS A total of twenty EGFR exon 19dels variants were identified. The patients were divided into three groups according to the first residue of the deletion, including E746, L747, and other residues (T751 or S752). The median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with EGFR TKIs was significantly different between groups (p \u003C 0.001). Patients harboring EGFR exon 19dels starting at T751 or S752 had the shortest median PFS (2.9 months), followed by those with E746 (11.4 months) and those with L747 (17.2 months). Analyzing 140 patients who had progressed on therapy, EGFR exon 19dels beginning at T751 or S752 were associated with a low incidence of the T790M mutation (16.7%). CONCLUSIONS Deletion location and type variants (with or without an insertion and/or a substitution) might affect first-generation TKI efficacy, and different EGFR exon 19dels should be considered when making decisions on which EGFR TKI should be used.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xu, Haiyan; Li, Weihua; Yang, Guangjian; Li, Junling; Yang, Lu; Xu, Fei; Yang, Yaning; Ying, Jianming; Wang, Yan","journal":"Targeted oncology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11523-020-00722-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsxNzY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EGFR","PFS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["different EGFR exon","first-generation EGFR TKIs","dels variants","T751","therapeutic response of patients","S752","months","first-generation TKI efficacy","type variants","L747","groups","E746","shortest median PFS","CONCLUSIONS Deletion location","large number of variants","first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors","insertion locations","median progression-free survival","BACKGROUND Epidermal growth factor receptor","clinical outcomes","differences","study","low incidence","mechanisms","substitution","residues","METHODS","deletions","therapy","published trials","T790M mutation","tumors","resistance","decisions","total","OBJECTIVE","aim"],"language":"en"},

This paper summarizes current evidence-base around the transmission dynamics, pathogenic, and clinical features of COVID-19, to critically identify if there are any gaps in the current IPC guidelines. METHODS This study involved a review of global COVID-19 IPC guidelines such as WHO, the CDC, and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Guidelines from two high income countries (Australia and UK) and one middle income country (China) were also reviewed. We searched publications in English on \u0027Pubmed\u0027 and Google Scholars. We extracted information related to COVID-19 transmission dynamics, clinical presentations and exposures that may facilitate the transmission and compared and contrasted these findings with the recommended IPC measures. RESULTS The review findings showed nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in health settings through droplet, aerosol and by an oral-fecal or fecal-droplet route. However, the IPC guidelines fail to cover all transmission modes and the recommendations also conflict with each other. Most guidelines recommend surgical masks for healthcare providers during routine care and N95 respirators for aerosol generating procedures. However, recommendations around type of surgical masks varied. In addition, CDC recommends cloth masks when the surgical mask is totally unavailable. CONCLUSION IPC strategies should consider all the possible routes of transmission and target all patient care activities where there may be person to person transmission risk. This review may assist international health agencies to update their guidelines.","publish_time":"2020-05-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Islam, M Saiful; Rahman, Kazi Mizanur; Sun, Yanni; Qureshi, Mohammed Owais; Abdi, Ikram; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Seale, Holly","journal":"Infection control and hospital epidemiology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2020.237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408911/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyMjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control","UK","Google Scholars","IPC","CDC"],"locations":["Australia"],"keyphrases":["transmission dynamics","current IPC guidelines","transmission modes","mode of transmission","person transmission risk","nosocomial transmission of SARS","possible routes of transmission","review of global COVID","review findings","clinical features of COVID","type of surgical masks","CONCLUSION IPC strategies","recommended IPC measures","aerosol","cloth masks","health settings","recommendations","public health response target","current evidence-base","international health agencies","fecal-droplet route","current absence of vaccine","routine care","oral-fecal","clinical presentations","high income countries","patient care activities","middle income country","healthcare providers","UK","N95 respirators","Disease Prevention","Control","European Centre","Australia","exposures","chain of infection","Pubmed","study","English","ECDC","China","procedures","OBJECTIVE","paper","addition","gaps","Google Scholars","publications","METHODS","information"],"language":"en"},

At any given time, CSU is believed to affect 0.5-1% of the global population. Omalizumab (a recombinant, humanized anti-immunoglobulin-E antibody) is the only approved treatment for antihistamine refractory CSU. However, ~ 30% of patients remain symptomatic at licensed doses of omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg, even after a treatment period of over 6 months. In the recent years, there have been several studies on updosing of the drug, suggesting that the individualized approach for urticaria treatment with omalizumab is useful. In this article, we provide an overview of these studies and the real-world data on omalizumab updosing as it became necessary to obtain complete CSU symptom control in a proportion of patients. Published observational studies (from June 2003 to October 2019) on the updosing of omalizumab in CSU were identified using PubMed and Ovid databases. Reports mainly show that updosing/dose adjustment evaluated with the assessment of disease activity (Urticaria Activity Score) and control (Urticaria Control Test) achieves better clinical response to omalizumab with a good safety profile in a pool of patients with CSU. These real-world data will provide an overview of updosing of omalizumab in CSU and aid in setting informed clinical practice treatment expectations.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Metz, Martin; Vadasz, Zahava; Kocat\u00FCrk, Emek; Gim\u00E9nez-Arnau, Ana M","journal":"Clinical reviews in allergy \u0026 immunology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-020-08794-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418171/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjsyMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Omalizumab"],"organizations":["CSU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["omalizumab updosing","updosing of omalizumab","urticaria treatment","overview of updosing","complete CSU symptom control","licensed doses of omalizumab","antihistamine refractory CSU","Urticaria Control Test","approved treatment","treatment period","Urticaria Activity Score","Chronic spontaneous urticaria","clinical practice treatment expectations","pool of patients","proportion of patients","real-world data","observational studies","better clinical response","assessment of disease activity","spontaneous development of itchy hives","setting","aid","humanized anti-immunoglobulin-E antibody","good safety profile","recombinant","individualized approach","angioedema","drug","PubMed","dose adjustment","unknown causes","Ovid databases","months","given time","recent years","global population","weeks","article"],"language":"en"},

Our objective was to describe the anatomical characteristics of the acromial and coracoid process using computed tomography (CT). METHODS Descriptive, observational, transversal and retrospective study. A total of 155 CT of patients without shoulder pathology, of both genders, and indistinct age were evaluated and grouped by age: Group 1 \u003C 25 years; group 2 25-40 years; group 3 \u003E 40 years. The following parameters were evaluated: Acromial type (AcT), vertical coracoid distance (VCD), acromial tilt (AT), acromial projection (AP), critical shoulder angle (CSA), type of the subcoracoid outlet (TSO), and the area of the subcoracoid outlet (ASO). RESULTS Statistically significant differences were found between men and women for VCD (14.44 \u00B1 4.79 vs. 11.76 \u00B1 4.00 mm; p \u003C 0.001) and AP (3.66 \u00B1 4.71 vs. 1.62 \u00B1 4.99 mm; p \u003C 0.05) as well as between age groups 1 and 3 for AT (35.08 \u00B1 11.53 vs. 28.41 \u00B1 6.60; p \u003C 0.05) and ASO (398.99 \u00B1 153.91 vs. 255.56 \u00B1 124.58 mm2; p \u003C 0.001).

METHODS We performed a prospective analysis of patients with intracranial LVO who underwent successful MT and received a 1.5 T MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in standard- and high-resolution as well as susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) on the day following the intervention. Reperfusion grade was assessed on post-thrombectomy digital subtraction angiography (DSA) using the expanded thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (eTICI) scale. Punctuate DWI lesions distal to the DWI core lesion were classified as peripheral emboli. DWI lesions outside the primary affected vascular territory were classified as emboli into new territories. Additionally, SWI and post-thrombectomy DSA were analyzed and correlated to findings on DWI. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients undergoing successful MT met the inclusion criteria. In 26/28 patients (93%), a total of 324 embolic lesions were detected in DWI representing 2.1% of the cumulated ischemic core volume. 151 peripheral emboli were detected in standard-resolution DWI, 173 additional emboli were uncovered in high-resolution DWI. Eight out of nine patients with an eTICI 3 reperfusion had embolic lesions (29 DWI lesions). 9.6% (31/324) of peripheral emboli were observed in vascular territories not affected by the LVO. SWI lesions were observed in close proximity to 10.2% (33/324) of DWI lesions. CONCLUSIONS Peripheral emboli are frequent after MT even after complete reperfusion. These emboli occur rather in the vascular territory of the occluded vessel than in other territories. A large proportion of peripheral emboli is only detected by high-resolution DWI.","publish_time":"2020-01-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sch\u00F6nfeld, Michael H; Kabiri, Reza; Kniep, Helge C; Meyer, Lukas; Sedlacik, Jan; Ernst, Marielle; Broocks, Gabriel; Faizy, Tobias D; Cheng, Bastian; Thomalla, G\u00F6tz; Fiehler, Jens; Hanning, Uta","journal":"Journal of neurology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-09719-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31997037/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszMzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LVO","DSA","DWI","SWI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["high-resolution DWI","DWI lesions distal","incidence of peripheral emboli","CONCLUSIONS Peripheral emboli","additional emboli","SWI lesions","DWI core lesion","standard-resolution DWI","large proportion of peripheral emboli","embolic lesions","successful MT","vascular territories","intracranial LVO","successful mechanical thrombectomy","post-thrombectomy DSA","eTICI","primary affected vascular territory","prospective analysis of patients","Reperfusion grade","complete reperfusion","new territories","intracranial large vessel occlusions","diffusion-weighted imaging","susceptibility-weighted imaging","post-thrombectomy digital subtraction angiography","occluded vessel","cumulated ischemic core volume","expanded thrombolysis","T MRI","cerebral infarction","inclusion criteria","scale","AIM","day","close proximity","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","METHODS","total","findings","intervention"],"language":"en"},

METHODS In this retrospective study, 30 patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 admitted to our hospital from January 18 to February 5, 2020, were selected as the research subjects. All cases were examined by lung ultrasound and CT. Lung lesions were reviewed by blinded observers, with imaging scores being used to analyze the ultrasound findings of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and with chest CT being used as the reference standard. The clinical value of ultrasound in the noninvasive assessment of lung lesions was evaluated. RESULTS Lung ultrasound signs in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 were mainly manifested as interstitial pulmonary edema (90.0 %, 27/30) and pulmonary consolidations (20.0 %, 6/30). The lung lesions were mainly distributed in the subpleural and peripheral pulmonary zones. The lower lobe and the dorsal region had a greater tendency to be involved. There was moderate agreement (Kappa = 0.529) between the noninvasive assessment of bedside ultrasound for lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and CT. The ultrasound scores to evaluate mild, moderate and severe lung lesions exhibited sensitivity of 68.8 % (11/16), 77.8 % (7/9), 100.0 % (2/2), specificity of 85.7 % (12/14), 76.2 % (16/21), 92.9 % (26/28), and diagnostic accuracy of 76.7 % (23/30), 76.7 % (23/30), 93.3 % (28/30), respectively. The follow-up dynamic ultrasound examination showed that the condition of all patients worsened gradually, with the ultrasound scores of lung lesions increasing to varying degrees. CONCLUSION Though the diagnostic efficacy of bedside ultrasound is relatively low for mild to moderate patients, it is high for severe patients. Bedside ultrasound has important clinical significance for noninvasive assessment and dynamic observation of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19, which is worth further consideration.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lu, Wuzhu; Zhang, Shushan; Chen, Binghui; Chen, Jiaxin; Xian, Jianzhong; Lin, Yuhong; Shan, Hong; Su, Zhong Zhen","journal":"Ultraschall in der Medizin","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1154-8795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32294796/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjszNTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ultrasound scores of lung lesions","ultrasound findings of lung lesions","severe lung lesions","noninvasive assessment of lung lesions","diagnosis of lung lesions of Coronavirus Disease","RESULTS Lung ultrasound signs","dynamic observation of lung lesions","moderate patients","clinical value of ultrasound","severe patients","clinical value of noninvasive assessment of bedside ultrasound","diagnostic efficacy of bedside ultrasound","follow-up dynamic ultrasound examination","moderate agreement","imaging scores","pulmonary consolidations","important clinical significance","peripheral pulmonary zones","interstitial pulmonary edema","retrospective study","diagnostic accuracy","dorsal region","blinded observers","chest CT","subpleural","condition","sensitivity","varying degrees","lower lobe","greater tendency","CONCLUSION","Kappa","reference standard","METHODS","cases","research subjects","consideration","PURPOSE","hospital","specificity"],"language":"en"},

The correct use of personal protective equipment and strict compliance with the behavioral guidelines are essential to reduce the potential risk of infection.

The question has been raised on whether DPP4 modulation or inhibition may prevent infection and/or progression of the COVID-19. A docked complex model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and DPP4 has been proposed, showing a large interface between the proteins and proposing close similarity with other coronaviruses using DPP4 as functional receptor. In absence of experimental validation, these data should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, this observation may rise the question on whether DPP4 is directly involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell adhesion/virulence, and whether DPP4 inhibition might be a therapeutic strategy for preventing infection. Although a direct involvement of DPP4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be clarified, there is also evidence suggesting that DPP4i modulate inflammation and exert anti-fibrotic activity. These properties may be of potential use for halting progression to the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe COVID-19. Taken together these findings may suggest a potential role for DPP4 inhibition or modulation in one or more steps of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS we reviewed 3D US volumes acquired transvaginally (TVUS) through the anterior fontanelle, between 14-17 weeks. The following landmarks were recognized: tela-choroidea (TC), foramina of Moro, early CC and the evolving cavum septi pellucidi. The following measurements were taken: total, anterior and posterior sections, and height of the CC (referenced to the anterior TC border). All measurements were correlated to both the gestational age and the transverse cerebellar diameter (TCD).

OBJECTIVE To prospectively analyze the impact of HRQoL between obese patients who underwent surgery and those who were wait-listed. METHODS Between April 2017 and March 2018, 70 surgical and 69 wait-listed patients were interviewed twice, at baseline and at the 12-month follow-up. Quality of life was measured by the SF-12v2 and the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQoL-Lite) questionnaires. Sociodemographic-, clinical-, and surgical-related variables were collected. RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine patients were analyzed, showing similar baseline characteristics but differences in HRQoL. Performing more qualified work improved scores on some aspects of the SF-12 survey. In contrast, women scored worse on the self-esteem domain, and men scored worse on the mental health domain. By group, at the 12-month follow-up, statistically significant differences were found among all aspects of the questionnaires between both groups (P \u003C 0.001) and between baseline and postoperative 12-month follow-up in the surgical group (P \u003C 0.001). Furthermore, scores were lower in all domains in the evolution of wait-listed patients, with statistically significant differences among the Bodily Pain, Emotional Role, Mental Health, and Mental Component Summary Domains (P \u003C 0.05). CONCLUSION HRQoL is a multimodal concept that allows the identification of factors impacting obese patients\u0027 quality of life. It promotes the benefit of surgery against waiting list delays, which can take up to 4 years in our hospital. Therefore, HRQoL is an important pillar to justify more resources for reducing unacceptable surgical delays.","publish_time":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moreno Gij\u00F3n, Mar\u00EDa; D\u00EDaz Vico, Tamara; Rodicio Miravalles, Jos\u00E9 Luis; L\u00F3pez-Negrete Cueto, Emilio; Su\u00E1rez S\u00E1nchez, Aida; Amoza Pais, Sonia; Sanz Navarro, Sandra; Vald\u00E9s Arias, Covadonga; Turienzo Santos, Estrella O; Sanz \u00C1lvarez, Lourdes M","journal":"Obesity surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-04652-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388708/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1NTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["wait-listed patients","impact of HRQoL","surgical group","related quality of life","obese patients\u0027 quality of life","surgical treatment","month follow-up","CONCLUSION HRQoL","mental health domain","surgical-related variables","unacceptable surgical delays","significant differences","aspects","questionnaires","evolution of wait","Mental Component Summary Domains","similar baseline characteristics","BACKGROUND Major impairment of health","IWQoL-Lite","Impact of Weight","self-esteem domain","benefit of surgery","SF-12v2","waiting list delays","qualified work improved scores","Bodily Pain","identification of factors","Emotional Role","resources","main reasons","multimodal concept","women","important pillar","groups","contrast","survey","years","hospital","OBJECTIVE","RESULTS","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a lesser-researched coronavirus, can infect naive pigs of any age, but clinical disease is observed in pigs \u22644 weeks of age. No commercial PHEV vaccines are available, and neonatal protection from PHEV-associated disease is presumably dependent on lactogenic immunity. Although subclinical PHEV infections are thought to be common, PHEV ecology in commercial swine herds is unknown. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, a serum IgG antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the S1 protein was developed and evaluated on known-status samples and then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds. Assessment of the diagnostic performance of the PHEV S1 ELISA using serum samples (n = 924) collected from 7-week-old pigs (n = 84; 12 pigs per group) inoculated with PHEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, or porcine deltacoronavirus showed that a sample-to-positive cutoff value of \u22650.6 was both sensitive and specific, i.e., all PHEV-inoculated pigs were seropositive from days postinoculation 10 to 42, and no cross-reactivity was observed in samples from other groups. The PHEV S1 ELISA was then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds (19 states) using 2,756 serum samples from breeding females (\u003E28 weeks old) on commercial farms (n = 104) with no history of PHEV-associated disease. The overall seroprevalence was 53.35% (confidence interval [CI], \u00B11.86%) and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% (CI, \u00B13.70%).IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in commercial swine herds. This study provided evidence that PHEV infection is endemic and highly prevalent in U.S. swine herds. These results raised questions for future studies regarding the impact of endemic PHEV on swine health and the mechanisms by which this virus circulates in endemically infected populations. Regardless, the availability of the validated PHEV S1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) provides the means for swine producers to detect and monitor PHEV infections, confirm prior exposure to the virus, and to evaluate the immune status of breeding herds.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mora-D\u00EDaz, Juan Carlos; Magtoto, Ronaldo; Houston, Elizabeth; Baum, David; Carrillo-\u00C1vila, Jos\u00E9 Antonio; Temeeyasen, Gun; Zimmerman, Jeff; Pi\u00F1eyro, Pablo; Gim\u00E9nez-Lirola, Luis","journal":"mSphere","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00199-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376700/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs1NjE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PHEV","PHEV S1 ELISA"],"locations":["U.S."],"keyphrases":["PHEV seroprevalence","PHEV ecology","history of PHEV","PHEV S1 ELISA","PHEV-inoculated pigs","commercial PHEV vaccines","PHEV-associated disease","impact of endemic PHEV","monitor PHEV infections","subclinical PHEV infections","commercial swine herds","validated PHEV S1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","sow herds","serum samples","ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus","porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","porcine deltacoronavirus","swine producers","swine health","naive pigs","week-old pigs","status samples","immune status of breeding herds","transmissible gastroenteritis virus","porcine respiratory coronavirus","commercial farms","S1 protein","overall seroprevalence","herd seroprevalence","clinical disease","weeks of age","serum IgG antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay","weeks old","breeding females","lesser-researched coronavirus","neonatal protection","variety of diseases","future studies","knowledge","prior exposure","diagnostic performance","questions","paucity of information","days postinoculation","evidence","means","availability","states","Members of family Coronaviridae","mechanisms","lactogenic immunity","confidence interval","positive cutoff value","birds","mammals","results","gap","study","IMPORTANCE","Assessment","cross-reactivity","infected populations","groups"],"language":"en"},

Despite best current therapies, patients with recurrent MB experience have an alarmingly high mortality rate and often have limited therapeutic options beyond inadequate chemotherapy or experimental clinical trials. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature regarding treatment strategies employed in recurrent pediatric MB will evaluate previous salvage therapies in order to guide future clinical trials. The aim of this systematic review will be to investigate the efficacy and safety of salvage therapies for the management of children with progressive, treatment-refractory, or recurrent MB. METHODS We will conduct literature searches (from 1995 onwards) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Studies examining the survival and toxicity of therapies administered to treatment-refractory pediatric MB patients will be included. Two reviewers will independently assess the search results based on predefined selection criteria, complete data abstraction, and quality assessment. The primary outcomes of this review will be overall and progression-free survival. Secondary outcomes will include safety and toxicity of each therapy administered. The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using an appropriate tool. Due to the nature of the research question and published literature, we expect large inter-study heterogeneity and therefore will use random effects regression analysis to extract the combined effect. In additional analyses, we will investigate the role of re-irradiation and mono- vs. poly-therapy in recurrent disease, and whether molecular subgrouping of MB influences salvage therapy. DISCUSSION This systematic review will provide an overview of the current literature regarding salvage therapies for relapsed MB patients. Investigation of clinically tested therapies for children with recurrent MB has significant implications for clinical practice. By reviewing the efficacy and toxicity of MB salvage therapies, this study will identify effective therapeutic strategies administered to recurrent MB patients and can inform future clinical trials aimed to improve patient survivorship and quality of life.

PURPOSE To evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.org through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.gov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance. STUDY SELECTION Observational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. DATA EXTRACTION Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS Two retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case-control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence). Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence). Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19. LIMITATION Half the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables. CONCLUSION High-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients. Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE None.

Unfortunately, the information about early prediction factors for disease progression is relatively limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the risk factors of developing severe disease. The objective of the study was to reveal the risk factors of developing severe disease by comparing the differences in the hemocyte count and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. Methods In this retrospectively analyzed cohort, 141 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled in Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17, 2020 to February 26, 2020. Clinical characteristics and hemocyte counts of severe and non-severe COVID patients were collected. The differences in the hemocyte counts and dynamic profiles in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 were compared. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers for predicting disease progression. A concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve were calculated to assess the predictive accuracy. Results The data showed that the white blood cell count, neutrophil count and platelet count were normal on the day of hospital admission in most COVID-19 patients (87.9%, 85.1% and 88.7%, respectively). A total of 82.8% of severe patients had lymphopenia after the onset of symptoms, and as the disease progressed, there was marked lymphopenia. Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the neutrophil count (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.441, 95% CI = 1.954-10.090, p = 0.000), lymphocyte count (HR = 0.255, 95% CI = 0.097-0.669, p = 0.006) and platelet count (HR = 0.244, 95% CI = 0.111-0.537, p = 0.000) were independent risk factors for disease progression. The C-index (0.821 [95% CI, 0.746-0.896]), calibration curve, decision curve and the clinical impact curve showed that the nomogram can be used to predict the disease progression in COVID-19 patients accurately. In addition, the data involving the neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and platelet count (NLP score) have something to do with improving risk stratification and management of COVID-19 patients. Conclusions We designed a clinically predictive tool which is easy to use for assessing the progression risk of COVID-19, and the NLP score could be used to facilitate patient stratification management.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zheng, Yufen; Zhang, Ying; Chi, Hongbo; Chen, Shiyong; Peng, Minfei; Luo, Lifei; Chen, Linping; Li, Jun; Shen, Bo; Wang, Donglian","journal":"Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32352397/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs3ODI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Taizhou Hospital, Zhejiang Province","NLP"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["severe disease","severe patients","non-severe COVID patients","disease progression","neutrophil count","platelet count","hemocyte count","progression risk of COVID","lymphocyte count","management of COVID","confirmed COVID","decision curve","calibration curve","clinical impact curve","outbreak of coronavirus disease","risk stratification","independent risk factors","white blood cell count","HR","C-index","Taizhou Hospital","dynamic profiles","early prediction factors","Clinical characteristics","Multivariate Cox analysis","data","concordance index","differences","NLP score","China","lymphopenia","Multivariate Cox regression analysis","patient stratification management","predictive tool","predictive accuracy","day of hospital admission","Taizhou Public Health Medical Center","Zhejiang Province","potential biomarkers","information","hazard ratio","onset of symptoms","cohort","study","urgent need","nomogram","Conclusions","addition","Wuhan","total","Methods","Objectives","world"],"language":"en"},

OBJECTIVES Here, we report the current annual burden of life-threatening and debilitating fungal diseases in the Netherlands. METHODS The most recent available epidemiological data, reported incidence and prevalence of fungal diseases were used for calculations. RESULTS Overall, we estimate that the annual burden of serious invasive fungal infections in the Netherlands totals 3,185 patients, including extrapulmonary or disseminated cryptococcosis (n=9), pneumocystis pneumonia (n=740), invasive aspergillosis (n=1,283), chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (n=257), invasive Candida infections (n=684), mucormycosis (n=15) and Fusarium keratitis (n=8). Adding the prevalence of recurrent vulvo-vaginal candidiasis (n=220,043), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (n=13,568) and severe asthma with fungal sensitisation (n=17,695), the total debilitating burden of fungal disease in the Netherlands is 254,491 patients yearly, approximately 1.5% of the country\u0027s population. CONCLUSION We estimated the annual burden of serious fungal infections in the Netherlands at 1.5% of the population based on previously reported modelling of fungal rates for specific populations at risk. With emerging new risk groups and increasing reports on antifungal resistance, surveillance programs are warranted to obtain more accurate estimates of fungal disease epidemiology and associated morbidity and mortality.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Buil, Jochem B; Meijer, Eelco F J; Denning, David W; Verweij, Paul E; Meis, Jacques F","journal":"Mycoses","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32297377/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["fungal sensitisation","specific fungal diseases","prevalence of fungal diseases","BACKGROUND Fungal diseases","annual burden of serious fungal infections","annual burden of serious invasive fungal infections","total debilitating burden of fungal disease","reported modelling of fungal rates","accurate estimates of fungal disease epidemiology","global disease burden","invasive aspergillosis","current annual burden of life-threatening","Netherlands totals","invasive Candida infections","patients","chronic pulmonary aspergillosis","allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis","regional estimates","specific populations","country\u0027s population","emerging new risk groups","prevalence of recurrent vulvo-vaginal candidiasis","reports","incidence","antifungal resistance","recent available epidemiological data","associated morbidity","extrapulmonary","severe asthma","surveillance programs","METHODS","mortality","cryptococcosis","pneumocystis pneumonia","Fusarium keratitis","CONCLUSION","calculations","mucormycosis","OBJECTIVES","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

We present a case of how several hospital systems-based interventions, intended to slow viral spread and to protect health care workers, have inadvertently created barriers to routine palliative interventions in this patient population. Isolation of patients, limitation of visitors and interdisciplinary support, and changes in nursing and provider assessment have all had their impact on how we deliver palliative care. These barriers have altered many aspects of our established workflow and algorithms for care, including changes in communication, goals of care discussions, how providers and nurses are monitoring for symptoms, and end-of-life monitoring. These challenges required real-time solutions such as technology utilization, proposing a change in medical delivery systems, and reducing redundancy to preserve personal protective equipment.

As of February 19th , 2020, there had been 333 confirmed cases reported in Shanghai, China. This study elaborates on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 based on a descriptive study of the 333 patients infected with COVID-19 in Shanghai for the purpose of probing into this new disease and providing reference. Among the 333 confirmed cases in Shanghai, 172 (51.7%) were males and 161 (48.3%) were females, with a median age of 50 years. 299 (89.8%) cases presented mild symptoms. 139 (41.7%) and 111 (33.3%) cases were infected in Wuhan and Shanghai, respectively. 148 (44.4%) cases once had contact with confirmed cases before onset, while 103 (30.9%) cases had never contacted confirmed cases but they had a sojourn history in Wuhan. The onset date of the first case in Shanghai was December 28th , with the peak appearing on January 27th . The median incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 7.2 days. 207 (62.2%) cases had fever symptoms at the onset, whereas 273 (82.0%) cases experienced fever before hospitalization. 56 (18.6%) adults experienced a decrease in white blood cell and 84 (42.9%) had increased c-reactive protein after onset. Elderly, male, and heart disease history were risk factors for severe or critical pneumonia. These findings suggest that most cases experienced fever symptoms and had mild pneumonia. Strengthening the health management of elderly men, especially those with underlying diseases, may help reduce the incidence of severe and critical pneumonia. Time intervals from onset to visit, hospitalization and diagnosis confirmed were all shortened after Shanghai\u0027s first-level public health emergency response.

A flexible bronchoscopy-guided water-cooled microwave ablation (MWA) catheter was developed to evaluate the feasibility and safety both in ex vivo and in vivo porcine models. Methods Using direct penetration of the catheter through the surface of ex vivo porcine lung, ablations (n=9) were performed at 70, 80, 90 W for 10 minutes. Temperatures of the catheter and 10, 15, 20 mm away from the tip were measured. Under bronchoscopy conditions in porcine lung, ablations (n=18, 6 in ex vivo and 12 in vivo) were performed at 80 W for 5 minutes. Computed tomography (CT) was acquired perioperative, 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post ablation. Ablation zones were excised at 24 hours and 4 weeks respectively. Long-axis diameter (Dl) and short-axis diameter (Ds) were measured and tissues were sectioned for pathological examination. Results In-ex vivo lung, the temperature at 20 mm removed was over 60 \u00B0C at 80 W for 288\u00B126 seconds. The ablations under bronchoscopic conditions were successful in-ex vivo and in vivo lung. No complications occurred during the procedures.

We aimed to review published cost-effectiveness analyses of lifestyle interventions compared with usual care on clinically relevant outcome measures. Five international and six grey-literature databases were searched from 2007 to 2018. Articles were assessed for quality of reporting. Data were extracted from healthcare and societal perspectives. Costs were adapted to the common currencies of Australia and the United Kingdom by adjusting for resource utilization, healthcare purchase price and changes in costs over time. Included studies were economic analyses of lifestyle interventions aiming to limit weight-gain during pregnancy and/or reduce risk of gestational diabetes, for women with a BMI of 25 or greater in pre- or early-pregnancy. RECENT FINDINGS Of the 538 articles identified, six were retained for review: one modelling study and five studies in which an economic analysis was performed alongside a randomized-controlled trial. Outcome measures included infant birth-weight, fasting glucose, insulin resistance, gestational weight-gain, infant respiratory distress syndrome, perceived health, cost per case of adverse outcome avoided and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Interventions were cost-effective in only one study. Although many studies have investigated the efficacy of lifestyle interventions in pregnancy, few have included cost-effectiveness analyses. Where cost-effectiveness studies were undertaken, results were inconsistent. Secondary meta-analysis, taxonomy and framework research is now required to determine the effective components of lifestyle interventions and to guide future cost-effectiveness analyses.","publish_time":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bailey, Cate; Skouteris, Helen; Teede, Helena; Hill, Briony; De Courten, Barbora; Walker, Ruth; Liew, Danny; Thangaratinam, Shakila; Ademi, Zanfina","journal":"Current diabetes reports","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11892-020-1288-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32008111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIzLmNzdjs5Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1266586,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:02Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"FmYU3uBXy5Qoxt3e55b75w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_23.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PURPOSE OF REVIEW Lifestyle"],"locations":["Australia","United Kingdom"],"keyphrases":["cost-effectiveness studies","economic analyses of lifestyle interventions","published cost-effectiveness analyses of lifestyle interventions","efficacy of lifestyle interventions","PURPOSE OF REVIEW Lifestyle interventions","gestational weight-gain","future cost-effectiveness analyses","effective components of lifestyle interventions","pregnancy","excessive gestational weight gain","infant birth-weight","case of adverse outcome","relevant outcome measures","economic analysis","Costs","Articles","risk of gestational diabetes","quality of reporting","modelling study","healthcare purchase price","adverse maternal events","Secondary meta-analysis","infant respiratory distress syndrome","quality-adjusted life years","perceived health","fasting glucose","insulin resistance","resource utilization","usual care","changes","benefit","United Kingdom","taxonomy","physical activity","diet","framework research","common currencies of Australia","BMI","QALYs","women","grey-literature databases","time","results","randomized-controlled trial","societal perspectives","RECENT FINDINGS"],"language":"en"},

Several trials are currently underway evaluating the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for acute infection. However, polypharmacy predisposes patients to increased risk of drug-drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine and may render many in this population ineligible to participate in trials. OBJECTIVES We aimed to quantify the degree of polypharmacy and burden of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) that older hospitalized adults are taking which would interact with hydroxychloroquine. METHODS We reanalyzed data from the cohort of patients 65 years and older enrolled in the MedSafer pilot study. We first identified patients taking medications with potentially harmful drug-drug interactions with hydroxychloroquine that might exclude them from participation in a typical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapeutic trial. Next, we identified medications that were flagged by MedSafer as being potentially inappropriate and crafted guidance around medication management if contemplating the use of hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS The cohort contained a total of 1,001 unique patients with complete data on their home medications at admission. Of these 1,001 patients, 590 (58.9%) were receiving one or more home medications that could potentially interact with hydroxychloroquine, and of these 255 (43.2%) were flagged as potentially inappropriate by the MedSafer tool. Common classes of PIMs observed were antipsychotics, cardiac medications, and anti-diabetic agents. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of medication optimization and deprescribing PIMs in older adults. By acting now to reduce polypharmacy and use of PIMs, we can better prepare this vulnerable population for inclusion in trials and, if substantiated, pharmacologic treatment or prevention of COVID-19.

In this report, we generate a recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. A fusion protein containing an ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity is also used in this study. The fusion proteins are then characterized. Both fusion proteins have a high binding affinity for the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and exhibit desirable pharmacological properties in mice. Moreover, the fusion proteins neutralize virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in vitro. As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronaviruses, they have potential applications in the diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lei, Changhai; Qian, Kewen; Li, Tian; Zhang, Sheng; Fu, Wenyan; Ding, Min; Hu, Shi","journal":"Nature communications","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16048-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32332765/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","fusion proteins","treatment of SARS","receptor-binding domains of SARS","spike proteins","ACE2 mutant","extracellular domain of human ACE2","recombinant protein","high binding affinity","cell entry receptor","human immunoglobulin IgG1","Fc region","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","coronaviruses","prophylaxis","angiotensin","low catalytic activity","potential applications","cross-reactivity","specific antiviral treatments","vaccines available","diagnosis","desirable pharmacological properties","mice","Wuhan","enzyme","China","end","report","study"],"language":"en"},

In the study, we aimed to dissect the dynamic profile and clinical implications of hematological findings in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the hematological findings of 72 patients with COVID-19 admitted from January 21 to February 17, 2020. The final date of follow-up was March 20, 2020. Dynamic profile of vital hematological parameters in severe and non-severe patients was presented at different time points (day 1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 after admission), and the correlation of hematological parameters with hospitalization time was indicated. Results Of 72 patients with COVID-19, lymphopenia and leukopenia occurred in 39 (54.2%) and 20 (27.8%) patients with COVID-19, respectively. Fifteen (20.8%) patients were defined as severe cases and 57 (79.2%) were non-severe cases. Compared to non-severe patients, leukocyte count, neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher, whereas lymphocyte count was declined in severe patients at each time point. A growing trend in platelet count was found in non-severe patients over the follow-up period. In addition, a positive correlation of NLR with hospitalization time was detected from day 5 after admission. Conclusions Dynamic changes in vital hematological parameters from severe and non-severe patients had been characterized in the course of hospitalization. During hospitalization, NLR was found to have certain relevance to the hospitalization days and a role in forecasting disease prognosis for patients with COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ding, Xiurong; Yu, Yanhua; Lu, Bichao; Huo, Jianbo; Chen, Ming; Kang, Yanfang; Lou, Jinli; Liu, Zhizhong","journal":"Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32441666/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsxNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["non-severe patients","hospitalized patients","non-severe cases","hospitalization time","prognosis of COVID","correlation of hematological parameters","Dynamic profile of vital hematological parameters","neutrophil count","lymphocyte count","hospitalization days","course of hospitalization","leukocyte count","platelet count","clinical implications of hematological findings","different time points","positive correlation of NLR","admission","Conclusions Dynamic changes","forecasting disease prognosis","coronavirus disease","lymphocyte ratio","follow-up period","final date of follow-up","role","world","certain relevance","people","growing trend","addition","lymphopenia","Objectives","leukopenia","Methods","severity","Results","studies","study"],"language":"en"},

To support WHO with their recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine during severe coronavirus outbreaks. OBJECTIVES We conducted a rapid review to assess the effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who live in regions with high transmission of the disease. SEARCH METHODS An information specialist searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 12 February 2020 and updated the search on 12 March 2020. WHO provided records from daily searches in Chinese databases up to 16 March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA Cohort studies, case-control-studies, case series, time series, interrupted time series, and mathematical modelling studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID-19. We also included studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened 30% of records; a single review author screened the remaining 70%. Two review authors screened all potentially relevant full-text publications independently. One review author extracted data and assessed evidence quality with GRADE and a second review author checked the assessment. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use. MAIN RESULTS We included 29 studies; 10 modelling studies on COVID-19, four observational studies and 15 modelling studies on SARS and MERS. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta-analysis and conducted a narrative synthesis. Due to the type of evidence found for this review, GRADE rates the certainty of the evidence as low to very low. Modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases averted 44% to 81% incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths compared to no measures based on different scenarios (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19, SARS, low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings (2 modelling studies on SARS). Very low-certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths was small (2 modelling studies on SARS). When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and control measures, including school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models demonstrated a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than individual measures alone (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID-19; onward transmission: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID-19; low-certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on COVID-19. AUTHORS\u0027 CONCLUSIONS Current evidence for COVID-19 is limited to modelling studies that make parameter assumptions based on the current, fragmented knowledge. Findings consistently indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the impact of the measures implemented. Testing in representative samples in different settings could help assess the true prevalence of infection, and would reduce uncertainty of modelling assumptions.

The SAG1 virus-like particles (SAG1-VLPs) were expressed by Sf9 cells, and their expression was confirmed through cloning, RT-PCR analysis, and western blot method. The immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy of SAG1-VLPs were assessed by the antibody response, cytokine analysis, neutralization activity, splenocyte assay, and survival rates through a mouse model. In particular, IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA were markedly increased after immunization, and the survival rates of T. gondii were strongly inhibited by the immunized sera. Furthermore, the immunization of SAG1-VLPs effectively decreased the production of specific cytokines, such as IL-1\u03B2, IL-6, TNF-\u03B1, and IFN-\u03B3, after parasite infection. In particular, the immunized group showed strong activity and viability compared with the non-immunized infection group, and their survival rate was 75%. These results demonstrate that SAG1-VLP not only has the immunogenicity to block T. gondii infection by effectively inducing the generation of specific antibodies against T. gondii, but is also an effective antigen delivery system for preventing toxoplasmosis. This study indicates that SAG1-VLP can be effectively utilized as a promising vaccine candidate for preventing or inhibiting T. gondii infection.","publish_time":"2020-04-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Choi, Won Hyung; Park, Ji Sun","journal":"Biomedicines","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines8040091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325746/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjsyMjc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SAG1-VLPs","gondii infection","SAG1 virus","immunization of SAG1","vaccine efficacy of SAG1","Toxoplasma gondii","immunized group","survival rates","non-immunized infection group","parasite infection","potential vaccine","toxoplasmosis","immunized sera","immunogenicity","study","promising vaccine candidate","cytokine analysis","neutralization activity","strong activity","surface antigen","RT-PCR analysis","generation of specific antibodies","production of specific cytokines","effective antigen delivery system","viability","splenocyte assay","antibody response","IFN-\u03B3","western blot method","expression","IgG1","IgG2a","TNF-\u03B1","cloning","particles","IgA","Sf9 cells","mouse model","vaccination effect","results"],"language":"en"},

Its impact on society and the health care system has compelled hospitals to quickly adapt and innovate as new information about the disease is uncovered. During this pandemic, essential medical and surgical services must be carried out while minimizing the risk of disease transmission to health care workers. There is an elevated risk of COVID-19 viral transmission to health care workers during surgical procedures of the head and neck due to potential aerosolization of viral particles from the oral cavity/naso-oropharynx mucosa. Thus, patients with facial fractures pose unique challenges to the variety of injuries and special considerations, including triaging injuries and protective measures against infection. The proximity to the oral cavity/naso-oropharyngeal mucosa, and potential for aerosolization of secretions containing viral particles during surgical procedures make most patients undergoing operative interventions for facial fractures high risk for COVID-19 transmission. Our proposed algorithm aims to balance patient care with patient/medical personnel protection as well as judicious health care utilization. It stratifies facial trauma procedures by urgency and assigns a recommended level of personal protective equipment, extreme or enhanced, incorporating current best practices and existing data on viral transmission. As this pandemic continues to evolve and more information is obtained, the protocol can be further refined and individualized to each institution.","publish_time":"2020-04-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hsieh, Tsung-Yen; Dedhia, Raj D; Chiao, Whitney; Dresner, Harley; Barta, Ruth J; Lyford-Pike, Sofia; Hamlar, David; Stephan, Scott J; Schubert, Warren; Hilger, Peter A","journal":"Facial plastic surgery \u0026 aesthetic medicine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1089/fpsam.2020.0185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302216/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszMzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral transmission","health care workers","patient care","health care system","surgical procedures","risk of disease transmission","potential aerosolization of viral particles","judicious health care utilization","facial trauma procedures","emerging viral illness","elevated risk of COVID","facial fractures high risk","oral cavity","patients","surgical services","pandemic","naso-oropharyngeal mucosa","naso-oropharynx mucosa","triaging injuries","variety of injuries","aerosolization of secretions","protective measures","new information","medical personnel protection","recommended level of personal protective equipment","operative interventions","existing data","unique challenges","head","neck","current best practices","special considerations","urgency","infection","society","compelled hospitals","proximity","proposed algorithm","impact","protocol","world","institution"],"language":"en"},

The prominence of phosphorylated molecules presents a conundrum given that phosphorylation is a thermodynamically unfavorable, endergonic process in water, and most natural sources of phosphate are poorly soluble. We recently demonstrated that a semi-aqueous solvent consisting of urea, ammonium formate, and water (UAFW) supports the dissolution of phosphate and the phosphorylation of nucleosides. However, the prebiotic feasibility and robustness of the UAFW system are unclear. Here, we study the UAFW system as a medium in which phosphate minerals are potentially solubilized. Specifically, we conduct a series of chemical experiments alongside thermodynamic models that simulate the formation of ammonium formate from the hydrolysis of hydrogen cyanide, and demonstrate the stability of formamide in such solvents (as an aqueous mixture). The dissolution of hydroxylapatite requires a liquid medium, and we investigate whether a UAFW system is solid or liquid over varied conditions, finding that this characteristic is controlled by the molar ratios of the three components. For liquid UAFW mixtures, we also find the solubility of phosphate is higher when the quantity of ammonium formate is greater than urea. We suggest the urea within the system can lower the activity of water, help create a stable and persistent solution, and may act as a condensing agent/catalyst to improve nucleoside phosphorylation yields.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lago, Jennifer L; Burcar, Bradley T; Hud, Nicholas V; Febrian, Rio; Mehta, Christopher; Bracher, Paul J; Atlas, Zachary D; Pasek, Matthew A","journal":"Origins of life and evolution of the biosphere : the journal of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11084-020-09595-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388697/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjszODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UAFW"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["UAFW system","dissolution of phosphate","liquid UAFW mixtures","urea","solubility of phosphate","phosphate minerals","liquid medium","formation of ammonium formate","quantity of ammonium formate","activity of water","natural sources of phosphate","phosphorylation of nucleosides","prominence of phosphorylated molecules","nucleoside phosphorylation yields","varied roles of phosphorylated organic molecules","varied conditions","dissolution of hydroxylapatite","aqueous mixture","semi-aqueous solvent","thermodynamic models","help","catalyst","biochemistry","robustness","hydrolysis of hydrogen cyanide","series of chemical experiments","solvents","characteristic","endergonic process","conundrum","condensing agent","prebiotic feasibility","molar ratios","stability of formamide","persistent solution","origin of life","components"],"language":"en"},

Free flap and VTE thromboprophylaxis may coincide but tend to vary from surgeon to surgeon. This study identifies VTE prophylaxis patterns and perceptions among H\u0026N microsurgeons in the United States. METHODS An online survey on VTE prophylaxis practice patterns and perceptions was emailed to 172 H\u0026N microsurgeons in the United States using an anonymous link. RESULTS There were 74 respondents (43% response rate). These surgeons completed residencies in otolaryngology (59%), plastic surgery (31%), and oral maxillofacial surgery (7%). Most underwent fellowship training (95%) and have practiced at an academic center (97%) for at least 6 years (58%), performing an average of 42 \u00B1 31 H\u0026N free flap cases per year (range = 1-190). Most adhered to general VTE prophylaxis guidelines (69%) while 11% did not and 20% were unsure. Nearly all surgeons (99%) would provide prophylactic anticoagulation, mostly in the form of subcutaneous heparin (51%) or enoxaparin (44%); 64% additionally used aspirin, while 4% used aspirin alone. The majority of surgeons (68%) reported having postoperative VTE complications, with six surgeons (8%) reporting patient deaths due to pulmonary embolism. A third of the surgeons have encountered VTE prophylaxis-related adverse bleeding events, but most still believe that chemoprophylaxis is important for VTE prevention (92%). While 35% of surgeons were satisfied with their current practice, most would find it helpful to have official prophylactic anticoagulation guidelines specific to H\u0026N free flap cases. CONCLUSION The majority of microsurgeons experienced postoperative VTE complications after H\u0026N free flap reconstruction despite the routine use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Though bleeding events are a concern, most surgeons believe chemoprophylaxis is important for VTE prevention and would welcome official guidelines specific to this high-risk population.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Venkatesh, Kaushik P; Ambani, Shoshana W; Arakelians, Aris R L; Johnson, Jonas T; Solari, Mario G","journal":"Journal of reconstructive microsurgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1710553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408367/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI0LmNzdjs0NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1261116,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:59Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"vQ2v2YFzi5jAA1ERZUZ58g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_24.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["VTE prevention","VTE thromboprophylaxis","VTE prophylaxis patterns","postoperative VTE complications","N microsurgeons","general VTE prophylaxis guidelines","VTE prophylaxis practice patterns","majority of surgeons","N free flap reconstruction","N free flap cases","VTE prophylaxis-related adverse bleeding events","official prophylactic anticoagulation guidelines specific","majority of microsurgeons","official guidelines specific","perceptions","routine use of prophylactic anticoagulation","United States","chemoprophylaxis","used aspirin","microvascular reconstruction","high-risk population","current practice","plastic surgery","oral maxillofacial surgery","high risk","neck","online survey","venous thromboembolism","head","reporting patient deaths","pulmonary embolism","METHODS","range","concern","study","BACKGROUND Patients","respondents","form of subcutaneous heparin","anonymous link","otolaryngology","CONCLUSION","response rate","residencies","fellowship training","academic center","RESULTS","enoxaparin","average","years"],"language":"en"},

These metabolic changes lead to loss of cell integrity, which induces dehydration intracellular and increase extracellular fluid. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived phase angle (PhA) is considered a good tool to evaluate hydration status, but in cancer patients it is not fully elucidated. Thus, in cancer patients the aims of this study were to (1) verify the association between PhA and fatigue, (2) verify the association between PhA and fatigue after adjustment for extracellular fluid accumulation, and (3) assess the prevalence of fatigue. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 124 patients of both genders on cancer treatment. Body weight, height, body mass index, handgrip strength, performance status, and cachexia were collected. In addition, body composition was evaluated by BIA to obtain hydration status and PA. The cut-off point used to classify patients with low PhA was set \u003C4\u00B0. To identify fatigue, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue questionnaire was applied. Of the 124 patients evaluated (n = 98/79% men), 26% had fatigue. The prevalence of fatigue was higher in patients with lower PhA \u003C4\u00B0 (65.63%). In the logistic regression analyses, we found that patients with PhA \u003E4\u00B0 had lower risk for fatigue (OR: 0.92 95% CI [0.86-0.99], p = 0.03) in the crude model, however after adjustments by weight loss percentage in 6 months, age, sex, and hydration the association was not maintained (OR: 0.94 95% CI [0.85-1.04], p = 0.26). In conclusion, we found that ~26% of cancer patients have fatigue. In spite of adjustment for extracellular fluid, PhA is not associated with fatigue. The importance of measuring PhA to assess intra and extracellular hydration in cancer patients is highlighted.","publish_time":"2020-03-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gomes, Tatyanne L N; Soares, J\u00E9ssika D P; Borges, Tha\u00EDs C; Pichard, Claude; Pimentel, Gustavo D","journal":"European journal of clinical nutrition","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-020-0597-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123343/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BIA","PhA","Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Cancer patients","prevalence of fatigue","lower PhA","low PhA","extracellular hydration","cancer treatment","hydration status","Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue questionnaire","importance of measuring PhA","association","extracellular fluid accumulation","Body weight","BIA","performance status","body composition","body mass index","weight loss percentage","metabolic changes lead","pathophysiological changes","spite of adjustment","lower risk","cross-sectional study","loss of cell integrity","handgrip strength","height","adjustments","months","dehydration intracellular","derived phase angle","cut-off point","Bioelectrical impedance analysis","sex","good tool","crude model","cachexia","genders","aims","logistic regression analyses","malnutrition","addition","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

The mandate of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) ended in 2015, and endemic countries are to plan and conduct elimination activities by themselves, with technical assistance by the Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (ESPEN). To this end, an elimination expert committee was set up in Cameroon in 2018. This committee identified the need to update the data on the current situation of onchocerciasis. The present study aims to systematically review and report all available epidemiological data, including prevalence, intensity and transmission of onchocerciasis to provide pertinent information that will be useful to design optimal strategies to achieve onchocerciasis elimination in Cameroon. METHODS PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science will be searched from inception onwards. Grey literature will be identified through Google Scholar searches, dissertation databases and other relevant documents such as government reports. Eligible studies will be mostly observational, including cohort and cross-sectional surveys. No limitations will be imposed on publication status and study period. The primary outcomes will be (1) the prevalence and intensity of Onchocerca volvulus infection in humans, (2) transmission intensity and (3) impact of interventions on prevalence, intensity and transmission of onchocerciasis. Secondary outcomes will be environmental and socio-demographic factors supporting the primary outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. Methodological quality including bias will be appraised using appropriate approaches. A narrative synthesis will describe quality and content of the epidemiological evidence. Prevalence and intensity of infection estimates will be stratified according to gender, age, geographical location and year of publication. DISCUSSION This study will provide the health authorities as well as the scientific community with up-to-date information about the epidemiological situation of onchocerciasis in Cameroon. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of the infection will help to define alternative and complementary strategies to accelerate onchocerciasis elimination in the country. Results of this review will also be used to update existing epidemiological models for onchocerciasis in order to fine-tune predictions of elimination timeframes in the country.

At the time of survey, fewer than 150 children in Australia and New Zealand had documented infection. The aim of this study was to assess attitudes, readiness and confidence in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic through an online survey of paediatric physicians and sub-specialists across Australia and New Zealand. METHODS Multiple email list groups were used to contact paediatric physicians to undertake an online Likert scale survey between 17 and 24 March. Respondents\u0027 specialty, experience and work setting were recorded. Ordinal logistic regression was used to determine respondent factors. RESULTS There were 542 respondents from across Australia and New Zealand: an estimated 11% of the paediatric physician workforce. A minority (36.6%) agreed that their national response had been well coordinated; the majority (92.7%) agreed that senior-level hospital administrators were taking the situation seriously. Most reported a good understanding of the natural history of COVID-19 in children, and knowledge of where to find local information. A large proportion of physicians (86.1%) were worried about becoming infected through their work; few (5.8%) reported that they would not come to work to avoid infection. Closure of school and childcares would reduce the ability to continue work at current capacity for 23.6% of respondents. CONCLUSION Despite limited experience in pandemics, most paediatric physicians felt informed. Concern about exposure at work is common; most were willing to work regardless. The closure of schools and daycares may have an impact on staffing. Coordination and leadership will be critical.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foley, David A; Kirk, Michael; Jepp, Catherine; Brophy-Williams, Sam; Tong, Steven Y C; Davis, Joshua S; Blyth, Christopher C; O\u0027Brien, Matthew P; Bowen, Asha C; Yeoh, Daniel K","journal":"Journal of paediatrics and child health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.14903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32364301/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyNTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","New Zealand"],"keyphrases":["work setting","online survey of paediatric physicians","Australia","New Zealand","paediatric physician workforce","children","time of survey","large proportion of physicians","infection","online Likert scale survey","natural history of COVID","limited experience","global pandemic","closure of schools","sub-specialists","pandemics","readiness","ability","METHODS Multiple email list groups","early stages","confidence","daycares","current capacity","Respondents\u0027 specialty","fewer","senior-level hospital administrators","good understanding","Ordinal logistic regression","study","impact","situation","attitudes","knowledge","childcares","CONCLUSION","Concern","exposure","respondent factors","Coordination","leadership","national response","local information","staffing","majority","aim","RESULTS","minority"],"language":"en"},

This is mainly caused by the adult human heart lacking the ability to regenerate upon injury, whereas zebrafish have the capacity through cardiomyocyte proliferation to fully regenerate the heart following injury such as apex resection (AR). But a systematic overview of the methods used to evidence heart regrowth and regeneration in the zebrafish is lacking. Herein, we conducted a systematical search in Embase and Pubmed for studies on heart regeneration in the zebrafish following injury and identified 47 AR studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Overall, three different methods were used to assess heart regeneration in zebrafish AR hearts. 45 out of 47 studies performed qualitative (37) and quantitative (8) histology, whereas immunohistochemistry for various cell cycle markers combined with cardiomyocyte specific proteins was used in 34 out of 47 studies to determine cardiomyocyte proliferation qualitatively (6 studies) or quantitatively (28 studies). For both methods, analysis was based on selected heart sections and not the whole heart, which may bias interpretations. Likewise, interstudy comparison of reported cardiomyocyte proliferation indexes seems complicated by distinct study designs and reporting manners. Finally, six studies performed functional analysis to determine heart function, a hallmark of human heart injury after MI. In conclusion, our data implies that future studies should consider more quantitative methods eventually taking the 3D of the zebrafish heart into consideration when evidencing myocardial regrowth after AR. Furthermore, standardized guidelines for reporting cardiomyocyte proliferation and sham surgery details may be considered to enable inter study comparisons and robustly determine the effect of given genes on the process of heart regeneration.","publish_time":"2020-02-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Juul Belling, Helene; Hofmeister, Wolfgang; Andersen, Ditte Caroline","journal":"Cells","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9030548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32111059/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjsyODQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["zebrafish heart","heart function","AR studies","process of heart regeneration","evidence heart regrowth","adult human heart","hallmark of human heart injury","future studies","selected heart sections","reporting cardiomyocyte proliferation","zebrafish AR hearts","quantitative methods","different methods","cardiomyocyte specific proteins","interstudy comparison of reported cardiomyocyte proliferation indexes","myocardial regrowth","reporting manners","functional analysis","study comparisons","Myocardial infarction","distinct study designs","various cell cycle markers","standardized guidelines","Pubmed","sham surgery details","immunohistochemistry","Embase","conclusion","consideration","effect of given genes","worldwide condition","histology","ability","apex resection","capacity","systematical search","millions of people","data","inclusion criteria","systematic overview","interpretations"],"language":"en"},

For CINV prophylaxis, 5-hydroxytryptamine type-3 receptor antagonists (5HT3-RAs) and neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists (NK1-RAs) are usually administered together with dexamethasone, which may increase the risk of serious infections in patients undergoing myeloablative treatment. The rationale of this multicenter, open-label and phase IIa study was to explore the efficacy of multiple doses of NEPA (netupitant/palonosetron) given as an every-other-day regimen without dexamethasone in preventing CINV in patients with relapsed-refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma (R/R-NHL), eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and treated with MD-HD-CT. Seventy patients participated to the study. According to the adopted Fleming one-stage design, the primary endpoint of this study was achieved. The CR values were 87.1% (primary endpoint, overall phase: days 1-8), 88.6% (acute phase: days 1-6), and 98.6% (delayed phase: days 7-8), while complete control (CR with no more than mild nausea) was 85.7% (overall phase), 88.6% (acute phase), and 95.7% (delayed phase). Moderate and severe episodes of nausea were reported by less than 10% of patients in the overall phase and less than 5% in both the acute and delayed phases. Regarding safety, NEPA was well tolerated with only one adverse event (constipation) evaluated as possibly related to NEPA administration. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that multiple alternate dosing of NEPA without the addition of dexamethasone is highly effective for preventing nausea and vomiting in this difficult setting, with a good tolerability profile.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Di Renzo, Nicola; Musso, Maurizio; Scim\u00E8, Rosanna; Cupri, Alessandra; Perrone, Tommasina; De Risi, Clara; Pastore, Domenico; Guarini, Attilio; Mengarelli, Andrea; Benedetti, Fabio; Mazza, Patrizio; Capria, Vera; Chiusolo, Patrizia; Cupelli, Luca; Federico, Vincenzo; Bozzoli, Valentina; Messa, Anna Rita; Codega, Paolo; Bonizzoni, Erminio; Specchia, Giorgina","journal":"Bone marrow transplantation","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41409-020-0909-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346078/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Fleming"],"organizations":["CINV","CT","NEPA","CR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["overall phase","acute phase","phase IIa study","hematological patients","days","induced nausea","multiple-day","mild nausea","NEPA administration","efficacy of multiple doses of NEPA","multiple alternate dosing of NEPA","receptor antagonists","primary endpoint","control of chemotherapy","CINV prophylaxis","severe episodes of nausea","addition of dexamethasone","MD-HD","vomiting","delayed phases","R-NHL","5HT3-RAs","NK1-RAs","serious concern","complete control","CR values","day regimen","risk of serious infections","relapsed-refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin\u0027s lymphoma","autologous stem cell transplantation","hydroxytryptamine type","open-label","ASCT","clinical findings","stage design","neurokinin","high-dose","difficult setting","antiemetics","myeloablative treatment","netupitant","good tolerability profile","adopted Fleming","availability","palonosetron","adverse event","constipation","rationale","conclusion","safety"],"language":"en"},

The neurocutaneous flap depends on the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) and its retrograde-flow has been studied via cadaveric dissection. The aim of this study is to prove the vascularity of the lateral antebrachial neurocutaneous (LABN) flap. METHODS The distally based LABN flap was created in 18 upper limbs (12 cadavers). The skin flap was dissected at the proximal half of the forearm and then diluted methylene blue was injected through the brachial artery. The pedicle of the flap on the distal half of the forearm was dissected along the LACN for the anatomical study of the perforating branches, paraneural vessels, and flap territory. RESULTS The mean age of cadavers was 74.1 years (nine males). The mean distance of most distal and proximal perforating branches from the radial styloid process were 2.32 \u00B1 0.59 and 11.17 \u00B1 1.72 cm, respectively. The mean total number of perforating branches was 7.4, which abundantly appeared approximately 4 to 5 cm from the radial styloid process. The mean flap territory was 8.64 \u00B1 0.82 cm in width and 10.50 \u00B1 1.90 cm in length. The mean forearm circumference was 24.84 \u00B1 1.52 cm, and mean forearm length was 24.74 \u00B1 1.8 cm. CONCLUSION This study ensured that retrograde-flow via the neurocutaneous artery could be provided through the vascularity of the LABN flap, which suggests that the pivot point of the flap should not extend beyond 5 cm proximal to the radial styloid process. The LABN flap is a useful alternative method for performing soft tissue reconstruction in hand and wrist defects without sacrificing the major vessels.","publish_time":"2020-05-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kanchanathepsak, Thepparat; Rojpitipongsakorn, Chanakarn; Tawonsawatruk, Tulyapruek; Suppaphol, Sorasak; Watcharananan, Ittirat; Tuntiyatorn, Panithan","journal":"Journal of reconstructive microsurgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1710551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408365/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIyLmNzdjs0ODE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1241552,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:45Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"5cLDeeGAV5QfWLrCqN5l5g==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_22.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LABN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["neurocutaneous flap","mean flap territory","skin flap","based LABN flap","axial pattern flap","mean forearm length","mean forearm circumference","mean distance","proximal perforating branches","neurocutaneous artery","radial styloid process","mean age of cadavers","mean total number of perforating branches","proximal half","soft tissue reconstruction","lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve","LACN","distal half","vascularity","anatomical study","retrograde-flow","paraneural vessels","upper extremities","major vessels","upper limbs","brachial artery","wrist defects","useful alternative method","favorable outcomes","hand","vascular supply","years","methylene blue","METHODS","BACKGROUND","pivot point","cadaveric dissection","males","CONCLUSION","pedicle","aim","width"],"language":"en"},

However, most existing methods neglect the complex correlation among data samples, which is important for capturing normal patterns from which the abnormal ones deviate. In this paper, we propose a method of Correlation aware unsupervised Anomaly detection via Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (CADGMM), which captures the complex correlation among data points for high-quality low-dimensional representation learning. More specifically, the relations among data samples are correlated firstly in forms of a graph structure, in which, the node denotes the sample and the edge denotes the correlation between two samples from the feature space. Then, a dual-encoder that consists of a graph encoder and a feature encoder, is employed to encode both the feature and correlation information of samples into the low-dimensional latent space jointly, followed by a decoder for data reconstruction. Finally, a separate estimation network as a Gaussian Mixture Model is utilized to estimate the density of the learned latent vector, and the anomalies can be detected by measuring the energy of the samples. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fan, Haoyi; Zhang, Fengbin; Wang, Ruidong; Xi, Liang; Li, Zuoyong","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7808f95fd4d2d9525503a6a5c828ac5c77bbf908.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206313.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206313/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["data samples","complex correlation","correlation information of samples","anomalous samples","data points","unstructured data","data reconstruction","feature encoder","graph encoder","feature space","method of Correlation aware unsupervised Anomaly detection","low-dimensional latent space","dual-encoder","Deep Gaussian Mixture Model","proposed method","graph structure","high-quality low-dimensional representation learning","learned latent vector","effectiveness","CADGMM","separate estimation network","real-world datasets","normal patterns","fundamental research","density","edge","forms","abnormal ones deviate","industrial applications","Extensive experiments","existing methods","node","anomalies","decoder","relations","paper","energy"],"language":"en"},

To adapt the complex computing environment in data centers, we proposed an innovative Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) deep reinforcement learning based approach called A2cScheduler for job scheduling. A2cScheduler consists of two agents, one of which, dubbed the actor, is responsible for learning the scheduling policy automatically and the other one, the critic, reduces the estimation error. Unlike previous policy gradient approaches, A2cScheduler is designed to reduce the gradient estimation variance and to update parameters efficiently. We show that the A2cScheduler can achieve competitive scheduling performance using both simulated workloads and real data collected from an academic data center.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Liang, Sisheng; Yang, Zhou; Jin, Fang; Chen, Yong","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f1696cf0eb451db24587e096eebab2f4ac4d710e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206316.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206316/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0OTA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["A2cScheduler","data centers","scheduling policy","real data","Efficient job scheduling","academic data center","competitive scheduling performance","gradient estimation variance","innovative Advantage Actor-Critic","previous policy gradient approaches","estimation error","based approach","deep reinforcement","simulated workloads","heterogeneous complexity","time","allocation of multi-dimensional resources","space","complex computing environment","parameters","agents"],"language":"en"},

Through shared in-depth empirical feelings and representations from a wide variety of cultural, historical, and social contexts, the article outlines an answer to the question: How do students, connected virtually but separated physically in an internationalized university, deal with disruption brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic? Student testimonies offer reflections on Covid-19 and Chinese international education, experiences of online teaching and learning, reflections on university coping mechanisms, an account of realities and feelings related to changes in academic life, and discussions on coping strategies in Chinese international higher education. Contributors expose their individual feelings, effects, benefits, challenges, and risk management strategies. Collected at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, these testimonies are unable to offer systemic answers to challenges facing the whole world. However, these experiences and feelings will provide important inputs to global discussions about the future of the world, after Covid-19.","publish_time":"2020-05-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peters, Michael A.; Wang, Hejia; Ogunniran, Moses Oladele; Huang, Yingying; Green, Benjamin; Chunga, Jasmin Omary; Quainoo, Eric Atta; Ren, Zhihong; Hollings, Stephanie; Mou, Chunxiao; Khomera, Sphiwe Wezzie; Zhang, Man; Zhou, Shuchen; Laimeche, Amina; Zheng, Wener; Xu, Rulin; Jackson, Liz; Hayes, Sarah","journal":"Postdigit Sci Educ","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/fc6b24b9b97b7e7d738aa4ce81692680de6dbd17.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7209765.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7209765/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs1NTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hejia Wang","Moses Oladele Ogunniran","Yingying Huang","Michael Peters"],"organizations":["Beijing Normal University"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Covid","pandemic","individual feelings","Chinese international education","challenges","Student testimonies","internationalized university","coping strategies","reflections","article","world","Chinese international higher education","shared in-depth empirical feelings","Beijing Normal University","experiences of online teaching","autoethnographical texts detailing student experiences","global discussions","risk management strategies","representations","benefits","learning","Moses Oladele Ogunniran","wide variety of cultural","academic life","important inputs","mechanisms","effects","changes","future","midst","Yingying Huang","social contexts","systemic answers","account of realities","disruption","Hejia Wang","question","deal","Contributors","peak","Michael Peters","Contributions","weeks","students"],"language":"en"},

The critical issue negotiators face during automated negotiation is that a negotiator may not always know the personality type of the opponent. Studies show that having information about the opponent improves the outcome of negotiation in general. However, unless there is prior knowledge, learning the opponent type in the limited amount of time or number of rounds in a negotiation is a difficult task. In this paper, we use a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) based modeling to perform better modeling of the opponent personality type. In particular, we focus on modeling the opponent into four different types to showcase that a better understanding of personality type can improve the outcome of automated negotiation. Our experiments performed using data sets generated from the IAGO software showcase that we indeed obtain better negotiation outcomes with a higher classification accuracy of the opponent personality type.","publish_time":"2020-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pucha, Sai Naveen; Paruchuri, Praveen","journal":"Group Decision and Negotiation: A Multidisciplinary Perspective","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f8e05ebfa6a4ebb09e7d599e05a5131573ce9a47.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7215177.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7215177/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs3MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IAGO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["opponent type","opponent personality type","outcome of negotiation","better negotiation outcomes","outcome of automated negotiation","better modeling","better understanding of personality type","better quality solutions","focus","computational agents","reasonable time frames","higher classification accuracy","POMDP","humans","critical issue negotiators face","Observable Markov Decision Process","subject of active research","data sets","number of rounds","IAGO software","different types","information","prior knowledge","difficult task","experiments","Studies","paper"],"language":"en"},

It has been 3 months, since we had the first cluster in China and we felt the need to look into certain regional patterns of transmission of the virus with respect to some distinctive living conditions, incidence of malaria, the genomics of different strains, and its impact on severity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data for 107 countries was compiled and correlation analysis was done between incidence of malaria and number of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Possibility of genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and reported zoonotic RNA viruses found associated previously with some Plasmodium species was explored by utilizing NCBI database. RESULTS: We found a significant inverse correlation between SARS-CoV-2 disease burden and incidence of Malaria. Our analysis also showed that a 12 base pair region encoding a part of surface glycoprotein of SARS- CoV-2 aligned with the Plasmodium associated zoonotic viral genome.

Four human CoVs (HCoVs), the non-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like HCoVs (namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), are globally endemic and account for a substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections. Non-SARS-like CoV can occasionally produce severe diseases in frail subjects but do not cause any major (fatal) epidemics. In contrast, SARS like CoVs (namely SARS-CoV and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) can cause intense short-lived fatal outbreaks. The current epidemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread globally is of major concern. There is scanty knowledge on the actual pandemic potential of this new SARS-like virus. It might be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is grossly underdiagnosed and that the infection is silently spreading across the globe with two consequences: (i) clusters of severe infections among frail subjects could haphazardly occur linked to unrecognized index cases; (ii) the current epidemic could naturally fall into a low-level endemic phase when a significant number of subjects will have developed immunity. Understanding the role of paucisymptomatic subjects and stratifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality. Whilst the future evolution of this epidemic remains unpredictable, classic public health strategies must follow rational patterns. The emergence of yet another global epidemic underscores the permanent challenges that infectious diseases pose and underscores the need for global cooperation and preparedness, even during inter-epidemic periods.","publish_time":"2020-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Raoult, Didier; Zumla, Alimuddin; Locatelli, Franco; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Kroemer, Guido","journal":"Cell Stress","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/50c57ac8c2a4ac111e208c2216db4e5524fc15ca.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://www.cell-stress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020A-Raoult-Cell-Stress.pdf","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs4MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Middle-East"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Non-SARS","contagious SARS-CoV","new SARS","global epidemic","current epidemic","MERS-CoV","severe diseases","frail subjects","inter-epidemic periods","non-severe acute respiratory syndrome","clusters of severe infections","significant number of subjects","severe clinical presentations","HCoVs","role of paucisymptomatic subjects","human CoVs","Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections","infectious diseases","global cooperation","major concern","low-level endemic phase","intense short-lived fatal outbreaks","classic public health strategies","actual pandemic potential","preparedness","large family of enveloped","stratifying patients","risk","need","permanent challenges","positive-strand RNA viruses","rational patterns","reasonable measures","NL63","OC43","scanty knowledge","account","rapid spread","developed immunity","HKU1","future evolution","unrecognized index cases","consequences","globe","Coronaviruses","epidemics","emergence","contrast","mortality"],"language":"en"},

Subjects were 1175 mother-child pairs. Emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity problems, peer problems, and low prosocial behavior were assessed using the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Compared with the CC genotype of SNP rs8079781, at least one T allele was significantly inversely related to childhood emotional problems: the adjusted OR was 0.68 (95% CI 0.46-0.998, P = 0.049).

Despite preventative measures, these injuries are occurring at increasing rates in athletes of all levels. UCL reconstruction techniques generally require a prolonged recovery period and introduce the potential for intraoperative complications prompting investigations into more conservative treatment measures based on specific patient and injury characteristics. The purpose of this review is to describe the current literature regarding the use of biologic augmentation in the management of UCL injuries. Specifically, this review will focus on the basic science background and clinical investigations pertaining to biologic augmentation utilizing platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and autologous stem cells. RECENT FINDINGS Despite some evidence supporting the use of PRP therapy in patients with partial UCL tears, there is no current consensus regarding its true efficacy. Similarly, due to a lack of clinical investigations, no consensus exists regarding the utilization of autologous stem cell treatments in the management of UCL injuries. Management of UCL injuries ranges from non-operative treatment with focused physical therapy protocols to operative reconstruction.

The psychosocial interactive model of resilience theorises that resilience might be \u0027switched on\u0027 in order to support and/or maintain smoking cessation for these populations. This study aimed to develop a Resilience Intervention for Smoking Cessation (RISC) through reviewing the extant literature around efficacious interventions for smoking cessation. Deliberative democracy principles were then used to understand lay perspectives regarding this potential smoking cessation program. METHODS Public health databases were searched to find efficacious psycho-social resilience interventions in the peer-reviewed literature for smoking cessation amongst lower SES populations. Potential components for RISC were selected based on evidence within the literature for their effectiveness. We then employed the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to create discussion and consensus on the most socially appropriate and feasible components from the perspective of smokers from low SES areas. The NGT included 16 people from a lower SES population in southern metropolitan Adelaide who indicated they were seriously contemplating quitting smoking or had recently quit. Data were collected from multiple Likert ratings and rankings of the interventions during the NGT workshop and analysed descriptively. The Wilcoxon signed-ranked test was used where appropriate. Qualitative data were collected from participant reflections and group discussion, and analysed thematically. RESULTS Six smoking cessation interventions, likely to enhance resilience, were selected as potential constituents for RISC: mindfulness training; setting realistic goals; support groups; smoke free environments; mobile phone apps; and motivational interviewing. Consensus indicated that mindfulness training and setting realistic goals were the most acceptable resilience enhancing interventions, based on perceived usefulness and feasibility. CONCLUSIONS This research applied principles from deliberative democracy in order to illuminate lay knowledge regarding an appropriate and acceptable smoking cessation resilience program for a lower SES population. This process of collaborative and complex knowledge-generation is critically important to confront inequities as an ongoing challenge in public health, such as smoking cessation for disadvantaged groups. Further research should involve development and trial of this resilience program.","publish_time":"2019-11-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tsourtos, George; Foley, Kristen; Ward, Paul; Miller, Emma; Wilson, Carlene; Barton, Christopher; Lawn, Sharon","journal":"BMC public health","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-7939-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31775709/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Consensus"],"organizations":["SES","Nominal Group Technique","NGT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["smoking cessation interventions","acceptable smoking cessation resilience program","potential smoking cessation program","quitting smoking","acceptable resilience","lower SES populations","BACKGROUND Smoking prevalence","efficacious interventions","efficacious psycho-social resilience interventions","RISC","psychosocial interactive model of resilience","Potential components","low SES areas","realistic goals","lay knowledge","mindfulness training","extant literature","support groups","potential constituents","Deliberative democracy principles","research","group discussion","NGT workshop","order","consensus","peer-reviewed literature","lay perspectives","METHODS Public health databases","disadvantaged groups","feasible components","Qualitative data","complex knowledge-generation","Nominal Group Technique","smoke free environments","mobile phone apps","perspective of smokers","inequities","participant reflections","rankings","southern metropolitan Adelaide","socioeconomic status","multiple Likert ratings","ongoing challenge","motivational interviewing","development","trial","people","RESULTS","process of collaborative","perceived usefulness","CONCLUSIONS","evidence","feasibility","test","effectiveness","study","Wilcoxon"],"language":"en"},

Thymosin alpha 1 (T\u03B11) had been used in the treatment of viral infections as an immune response modifier for many years. However, clinical benefits and mechanism of T\u03B11 supplement to COVID-19 are still unclear. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of 76 severe cases with COVID-19 admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to March 2020. The thymus output in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients was measured by T cell receptor excision circles (TREC). The levels of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 on CD8\u002B T cells were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS Compared with untreated group, T\u03B11 treatment significantly reduces mortality of severe COVID-19 patients (11.11% vs. 30.00%, p=0.044). T\u03B11 timely enhances blood T cell numbers in COVID-19 patients with severe lymphocytopenia (the counts of CD8\u002B T cells or CD4\u002B T cells in circulation lower than 400/\u03BCL or 650/\u03BCL, respectively). Under such conditions, T\u03B11 also successfully restores CD8\u002B and CD4\u002B T cell numbers in aged patients. Meanwhile, T\u03B11 reduces PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on CD8\u002B T cells from severe COVID-19 patients in comparison with untreated cases. It is of note that restoration of lymphocytopenia and acute exhaustion of T cells are roughly parallel to the rise of TRECs. CONCLUSIONS T\u03B11 supplement significantly reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with the counts of CD8\u002B T cells or CD4\u002B T cells in circulation lower than 400/\u03BCL or 650/\u03BCL, respectively, gain more benefits from T\u03B11.

To address the disadvantages of OLV with respect to difficulties in intubation and induction, as well as the risk of respiratory complications, two-lung ventilation (TLV) with artificial pneumothorax has been introduced for use in VATS-e. However, no studies have yet compared TLV and OLV with postoperative infection and inflammation in the prone position over time postoperatively. Here, we investigated the efficacy of TLV in patients undergoing VATS-e in the prone position. METHODS Between April 2010 and December 2016, 119 patients underwent VATS-e under OLV or TLV with carbon dioxide insufflation. Clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, and postoperative outcomes, including oxygenation and systemic inflammatory responses, were compared between patients who underwent OLV and those who underwent TLV. RESULTS Clinical characteristics other than pT stage were comparable between groups. The TLV group had shorter thoracic operation time than the OLV group. No patients underwent conversion to open thoracotomy. The PaO2/FiO2 ratios of the TLV group on postoperative day (POD) 5 and on POD7 were significantly higher than those of the OLV group. C-reactive protein levels on POD7 were lower in the TLV group than in the OLV group. There were no significant differences with respect to postoperative complications between the OLV and TLV groups. In the TLV group, the white blood cell count on POD7 was significantly lower than that in the OLV group; body temperature showed a similar trend immediately after surgery and on POD1. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we demonstrated that, compared with OLV, TLV in the prone position provides better oxygenation and reduced inflammation in the postoperative course. Accordingly, TLV might be more useful than OLV for ventilation during esophageal cancer surgery.","publish_time":"2020-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nomura, Shinsuke; Tsujimoto, Hironori; Ishibashi, Yusuke; Fujishima, Seiichiro; Kouzu, Keita; Harada, Manabu; Ito, Nozomi; Yaguchi, Yoshihisa; Saitoh, Daizoh; Ikeda, Takehiko; Hase, Kazuo; Kishi, Yoji; Ueno, Hideki","journal":"Surgical endoscopy","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07347-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31932926/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs5NDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["OLV","TLV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["OLV group","TLV groups","efficacy of TLV","disadvantages of OLV","patients","postoperative outcomes","postoperative complications","VATS-e","postoperative infection","postoperative day","postoperative course","POD7","prone position","lung ventilation","esophageal cancer surgery","respect","applied ventilation approach","thoracoscopic surgery","RESULTS Clinical characteristics","reduced inflammation","better oxygenation","surgical outcomes","risk of respiratory complications","shorter thoracic operation time","white blood cell count","pT stage","video","similar trend","difficulties","body temperature","standard","C-reactive protein levels","systemic inflammatory responses","artificial pneumothorax","FiO2 ratios","carbon dioxide insufflation","induction","intubation","significant differences","conversion","open thoracotomy","use","PaO2","BACKGROUND","studies","POD1","CONCLUSIONS","study","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction of the majority resolved within a year. Two (3\u00B73%) of the hypocortisolic cohort had transient subclinical thyrotoxicosis. Four (6\u00B77%) were biochemically hypothyroid, being comprised of three with central hypothyroidism and one with primary hypothyroidism. Two of the three with central hypothyroidism had concomitant central hypocortisolism. Eight had subnormal DHEAS levels. Conclusions These preliminary findings highlight a possible aetiologic role of SARS\u2010associated coronavirus in causing a reversible hypophysitis or direct hypothalamic effect, with the HPA axis affected more frequently than the HPT axis.","publish_time":"2005-07-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Leow, Melvin Khee\u2010Shing; Kwek, Daniel Seow\u2010Khee; Ng, Alan Wei\u2010Keong; Ong, Kian\u2010Chung; Kaw, Gregory Jon\u2010Leng; Lee, Lawrence Soon\u2010U","journal":"Clin Endocrinol (Oxf)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e17181b8cb2bdd46261ea65500bc8ac913f646e2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7188349.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188349/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs5OTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","HPA","HPT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS survivors","survivors of SARS","central hypothyroidism","patients","HPA axis","endocrine abnormalities","pre\u2010existing endocrine disorders","chronic endocrine sequelae","axis dysfunction","concomitant central hypocortisolism","primary hypothyroidism","HPT axis","year","possible aetiologic role of SARS","psychosomatic symptoms reminiscent of various endocrine disorders","evidence of hypocortisolism","direct hypothalamic effect","associated coronavirus","reversible hypophysitis","severe acute respiratory syndrome","prognostication","characterization of trends","preliminary findings","outbreak","hypocortisolic cohort","transient subclinical thyrotoxicosis","Objective","majority","pituitary","measurements","Serial evaluation","hormonal derangements","months","recovery","endocrinological aberrations","Conclusions","existence","Design","subnormal DHEAS levels","Results"],"language":"en"},

SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged and has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 has shown that it is of zoonotic origin. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 is found to be similar to SARS-CoV with virion size ranging from 70 to 90 nm. Spike, membrane, and envelope surface viral proteins of coronavirus are embedded in host membrane-derived lipid bilayer encapsulating the helical nucleocapsid comprising viral RNA. The genome comprises of 6\u201311 open reading frames (ORFs) with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking untranslated regions (UTRs). Sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV revealed no significant difference in ORFs and nsps. The nsps includes two viral cysteine proteases including papain-like protease (nsp3), chymotrypsin-like, 3C-like, or main protease (nsp5), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), helicase (nsp13), and others likely to be involved in the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2. The structure of spike glycoprotein structure of SARS-CoV-2 resembles that of the spike protein of SARS-CoV with an root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 3.8 \u00C5. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for internalization and TMPRSS2 serine proteases for S protein priming. Histopathological investigation of tissues from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed virus-induced cytopathic effect with signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome in lung cells. This chapter discusses about the morphology, genome organization, replication, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 that may help us understand the disease that may leads to identification of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines.","publish_time":"2020-04-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kumar, Swatantra; Nyodu, Rajni; Maurya, Vimal K.; Saxena, Shailendra K.","journal":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ff3a1e08a2a0a848d8711ee88db34a9197daea6c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189391.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189391/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsxOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","RNA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","replication of SARS","pathogenesis of SARS","spike protein of SARS","Genomic characterization of SARS","structure of spike glycoprotein structure of SARS","viral RNA","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","genome size","genome organization","viral cysteine proteases","single-stranded RNA virus","ORFs","nsps","envelope surface viral proteins of coronavirus","genus Coronavirus","main protease","TMPRSS2 serine proteases","S protein priming","virion size ranging","World Health Organization","host membrane-derived lipid bilayer","signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome","cytopathic effect","internalization","helical nucleocapsid","nsp12","ACE2 receptor","infected patients","lung cells","papain","nsp5","significant difference","identification of effective antiviral drugs","vaccines","helicase","morphology","root","transcription","Histopathological investigation of tissues","open reading frames","square deviation","nsp13","pandemic","chymotrypsin","nsp3","family Coronaviridae","RMSD","Sequence variation","untranslated regions","UTRs","nm","chapter","zoonotic origin","disease"],"language":"en"},

We retrospectively examined 44 confirmed COVID-19 cases. All cases were evaluated separately by radiologists (visually) and through an in-house computer software. The degree of lesions was visually scored by the radiologist, as follows, for each of the 5 lung lobes: 0, no lesion present; 1, \u003C1/3 involvement; 2, \u003E1/3 and \u003C 2/3 involvement; and 3, \u003E2/3 involvement. Lesion density was assessed based on the proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and fibrosis of the lesions. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included lung volume (mL), lesion volume (mL), lesion percentage (%), and mean lesion density (HU) of the whole lung, right lung, left lung, and each lobe. The scores obtained by the radiologists and quantitative results generated by the computer software were tested for correlation. A Chi-square test was used to test the consistency of radiologist- and computer-derived lesion percentage in the right/left lung, upper/lower lobe, and each of the 5 lobes. The results showed a strong to moderate correlation between lesion percentage scores obtained by radiologists and the computer software (r ranged from 0.7679 to 0.8373, P \u003C 0.05), and a moderate correlation between the proportion of GGO and mean lesion density (r = \u22120.5894, P \u003C 0.05), and proportion of consolidation and mean lesion density (r = 0.6282, P \u003C 0.05). Computer-aided quantification showed a statistical significant higher lesion percentage for lower lobes than that assessed by the radiologists (\u03C7(2) = 8.160, P = 0.004).

In Italy, up to the 2nd of April 2020, overall 139,422 confirmed cases and 17,669 deaths have been notified, while 26,491 people have recovered. Besides the overloading of hospitals, another issue to face was the capacity to perform thousands of tests per day. In this perspective, to support the National Health Care System and to minimize the impact of this rapidly spreading virus, the Italian Ministry of Health involved the Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali (IZSs), Veterinary Public Health Institutes, in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 by testing human samples. The Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell\u0027Abruzzo e del Molise is currently testing more than 600 samples per day and performing whole genome sequencing from positive samples. Sequence analysis of these samples suggested that different viral variants may be circulating in Italy, and so in Abruzzo region. CoVs, and related diseases, are well known to veterinarians since decades. The experience that veterinarians operating within the Public Health system gained in the control and characterization of previous health issues of livestock and poultry including avian flu, bluetongue, foot and mouth disease, responsible for huge economic losses, is certainly of great help to minimize the impact of this global crisis.","publish_time":"2020-04-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lorusso, Alessio; Calistri, Paolo; Mercante, Maria Teresa; Monaco, Federica; Portanti, Ottavio; Marcacci, Maurilia; Camm\u00E0, Cesare; Rinaldi, Antonio; Mangone, Iolanda; Di Pasquale, Adriano; Iommarini, Marino; Mattucci, Maria; Fazii, Paolo; Tarquini, Pierluigi; Mariani, Rinalda; Grimaldi, Alessandro; Morelli, Daniela; Migliorati, Giacomo; Savini, Giovanni; Borrello, Silvio; D\u0027Alterio, Nicola","journal":"One Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8615e4a0f5925f675d3f5072cef93bad0c15c2c7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200311.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7200311/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyODA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["National Health Care System","Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale","Public Health"],"locations":["Abruzzo"],"keyphrases":["Public Health system","SARS-CoV","positive samples","human samples","Italian Ministry of Health","Veterinary Public Health Institutes","National Health Care System","impact","veterinarians","day","Italy","characterization of previous health issues of livestock","novel coronavirus","related diseases","diagnosis of SARS","species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus","subgenus Sarbecovirus","mouth disease","poultry","IZSs","control","genus Betacoronavirus","foot","bluetongue","avian flu","Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali","huge economic losses","Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell\u0027Abruzzo e","Molise","family Coronaviridae","genome sequencing","face","capacity","different viral variants","thousands of tests","great help","overloading of hospitals","current pandemic","Sequence analysis","confirmed cases","deaths","Abruzzo region","global crisis","CoVs","experience","perspective","decades","people"],"language":"en"},

However, the psychological adaptation of migrants may be potentially facilitated by social self-efficacy\u2014the beliefs in one\u0027s ability to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships. Previous research suggests that social self-efficacy is positively related to adjustment and negatively related to loneliness, depression, and psychological distress. Research also confirms that self-efficacy beliefs can be effectively enhanced using Internet-based interventions. These results served as a background for creating the New in Town, a self-help Internet-based intervention for internal migrants in Poland that aims at increasing social self-efficacy. Exercises in the intervention are based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and relate to sources of self-efficacy beliefs: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and emotional and physiological states. Users complete increasingly challenging tasks that encourage them to interact with their environment. The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy of the New in Town intervention. METHODS: The efficacy of the New in Town intervention will be tested in a two-arm randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control group. Social self-efficacy will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include loneliness, perceived social support, and satisfaction with life. Additionally, we will measure user experience among participants allocated to the experimental group. We aim to recruit a total of N = 280 participants aged at least 18 years who have changed their place of residence in the last 6 months and have an Internet connection. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3-week post-test, and 8-week follow-up. DISCUSSION: The trial will provide insights into the efficacy of Internet-based self-help interventions in increasing social self-efficacy. Given that the intervention works, New in Town could provide an easily accessible support option for internal migrants in Poland. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT04088487) on 11th September 2019.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rogala, Anna; Szczepaniak, Maria; Michalak, Natalia; Andersson, Gerhard","journal":"Internet Interv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/568b2f94bdc926d60e78ef6ae1ec0c9b8178db9e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7200930.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7200930/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjsyODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","ClinicalTrials.gov"],"locations":["Poland"],"keyphrases":["social self-efficacy","efficacy of Internet","sources of self-efficacy beliefs","Town intervention","social support","self-help Internet-based intervention","Internet-based interventions","controlled trial","TRIAL REGISTRATION","participants","internal migrants","Internet connection","Poland","self-help interventions","loneliness","psychological adaptation of migrants","BACKGROUND","aim","challenging life transition","mastery experiences","vicarious experiences","Previous research","week post-test","experimental group","challenging tasks","week follow-up","psychological distress","accessible support option","waitlist control group","verbal persuasions","well-being","source of various problems","principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy","Migration","ability","insights","mental health","physiological states","primary outcome","months","depression","arm","baseline","satisfaction","adjustment","user experience","Secondary outcomes","place of residence","interpersonal relationships","Users","years","total of N","identifier","DISCUSSION","METHODS","NCT04088487","results","Exercises","environment"],"language":"en"},

We present a framework called Cross-data Automatic Feature Engineering Machine (CAFEM), which formalizes the FE problem as an optimization problem over a Feature Transformation Graph (FTG). CAFEM contains two components: a FE learner (FeL) that learns fine-grained FE strategies on one single dataset by Double Deep Q-learning (DDQN) and a Cross-data Component (CdC) that speeds up FE learning on an unseen dataset by the generalized FE policies learned by Meta-Learning on a collection of datasets. We compare the performance of FeL with several existing state-of-the-art automatic FE techniques on a large collection of datasets. It shows that FeL outperforms existing approaches and is robust on the selection of learning algorithms.

However, these supervised models require a large amount of labeled data which are usually very costly or unavailable. To this end, we propose a semi-supervised End-to-end MOVing-window Attentive framework (called EMOVA) that has three key features for aspect mining. (1) Two neural layers with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) are employed to learn representations of reviews.

From perspectives of content analysis and label decision, there are two major difficulties. One is content confusion that the case descriptions of some charges are almost identical. The other is dynamic label number that the numbers of labels (label number) of different cases may be different. In this paper, we propose a relation learning hierarchical framework for multi-label charge prediction with two models, i.e., dynamic merging attention (DMA) and number learning network (NLN). Specially, DMA can improve the charge prediction performance by dynamically learning the similarity relation between a fact and external knowledge (provisions) and the difference relation between different provisions, which alleviates the phenomenon of content confusion. NLN mitigates the dynamic label number by learning the co-occurring relation between labels. Moreover, we put the two models into a unified framework to enhance their effects.

For this reason, unsupervised and exploratory methods represent a fundamental tool to deal with the analysis of multivariate time series. In this paper we propose a deep-learning based framework for clustering multivariate time series data with varying lengths. Our framework, namely DeTSEC (Deep Time Series Embedding Clustering), includes two stages: firstly a recurrent autoencoder exploits attention and gating mechanisms to produce a preliminary embedding representation; then, a clustering refinement stage is introduced to stretch the embedding manifold towards the corresponding clusters.

In numerous real life applications, data are stored in sequential form, hence mining sequential patterns has been one of the most popular fields in data mining. Due to its various applications, across the past decades, a significant number of literature have addressed this problem and provided elegant solutions. In this paper we propose a novel tree data structure, SP-Tree, to store the sequence database in a new and efficient manner. Additionally, we propose a new mining algorithm Tree-miner to mine sequential patterns from SP-Tree. To further enhance the performance of our algorithm, we incorporate multiple pruning techniques and optimizations. As our SP-Tree stores the complete database, it can also be used for incremental and dynamic databases, tree-structure is particularly advantageous for interactive mining. We demonstrate how our SP-Tree based Tree-miner algorithm significantly outperforms all of the existing state-of-the-art algorithms, across 6 real life datasets. We conclude by discussing the possible extensions of our approach to other related fields of sequential data.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rizvee, Redwan Ahmed; Arefin, Mohammad Fahim; Ahmed, Chowdhury Farhan","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/62c46fa113fbd1eeb87a892665e4b60b29bcc751.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206258.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206258/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0MzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SP-Tree","Data mining","tree-structure","Tree-miner algorithm","novel tree data structure","new mining algorithm Tree-miner","raw data","related fields of sequential data","sequential patterns","interactive mining","sequential form","numerous real life applications","real life datasets","sequence database","various applications","complete database","popular fields","past decades","approach","actionable knowledge","significant number of literature","existing state-of-the-art algorithms","problem","multiple pruning techniques","dynamic databases","efficient manner","optimizations","paper","possible extensions","elegant solutions","performance"],"language":"en"},

That is, given two time series x and y, we are interested in detecting the causal relations among them considering the previous observations of both time series. Although, most of the algorithms are designed for causal inference among homogeneous processes where only time series from a specific distribution (mostly Gaussian) are given, many applications generate a mixture of various time series from different distributions. We utilize Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to propose a general information-theoretic framework for causal inference on heterogeneous data sets. We regard the challenge of causality detection as a data compression problem employing the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. By balancing the goodness-of-fit and the model complexity we automatically find the causal relations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets confirm the advantages of our algorithm ITGH (for Information-Theoretic Granger causal inference on Heterogeneous data) compared to other algorithms.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Behzadi, Sahar; Schelling, Benjamin; Plant, Claudia","journal":"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9525c11985c67a792c56dbe4da86cb90ba71e013.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206303.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206303/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIxLmNzdjs0Nzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1013030,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:39Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"CfDId24KXasy7yIAW1Hc7w==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_21.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Granger"],"organizations":["Generalized Linear Models"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["time series states","time series x","causal relations","mixture of various time series","Information-Theoretic Granger causal inference","heterogeneous data sets","real-world data sets","data compression problem","Granger causality","algorithms","general information-theoretic framework","challenge of causality detection","Minimum Description Length","GLM","advantages","algorithm ITGH","cause","homogeneous processes","Extensive experiments","different distributions","previous observations","MDL","principle","applications","specific distribution","model complexity","Generalized Linear Models","predictability","effect","goodness"],"language":"en"},

There are five distinct physiographic areas on the slope, each separated by sharp boundaries which mostly correspond to boundaries between features on the cliffs above. The physiography is a consequence of a series of landslides of different, but unknown, ages. A model of the physiographic history is presented. Each physiographic area supports a different vegetation community, also separated by sharp boundaries. The present structure of two communities, Melaleuca howeana scrub and Howea forsterana forest, is a consequence of damage by feral animals. Melaleuca scrub has replaced Cyperus lucidus sedgeland destroyed by goats (Capra hircus) browsing from 1914 until their extermination in 1955. Howea forest has a markedly unimodal age distribution with very few small individuals of the dominant palms. This is a result of the combined effects of browsing by goats on small palms, and seed predation by black rats (Rattus rattus) from the 1920s, preventing regeneration. Unless rat numbers are periodically reduced to reduce seed predation, regeneration may be insufficient to guarantee long\u2010term survival of the forest.","publish_time":"2006-07-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"PICKARD, JOHN","journal":"Austral Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4046f96f1134d42cc9ffd17b972b26e012788cb.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175997/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3MzE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Little Slope","Melaleuca"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Howea forest","sharp boundaries","Melaleuca scrub","Rattus rattus","seed predation","goats","Howea forsterana forest","small palms","physiographic history","regeneration","Melaleuca howeana scrub","distinct physiographic areas","small individuals","basalt cliffs","series of landslides","consequence of damage","Little Slope","dominant palms","different vegetation community","series of debris avalanche deposits","communities","Cyperus lucidus sedgeland","black rats","unimodal age distribution","southern end of Lord Howe Island","Capra hircus","present structure","combined effects","long\u2010term survival","feral animals","result","ages","model","physiography","features","rat numbers","extermination"],"language":"en"},

The discovery of its double life led to breathtaking advances in the understanding of virtually all aspects of its biology, including its structure, physiological and pathophysiological roles and cell biology. ACE2, like its well-known homologue, ACE, is a metallopeptidase which resides on the cell surface of the epithelial, and sometimes endothelial, cells of the heart, kidney, testes, lung and gastrointestinal tract. It is a type I transmembrane protein with a large catalytic extracellular domain which acts as both a peptidase and a viral receptor. This extracellular domain can be cleaved from the cell surface by other peptidases, modulating its activity. The levels of the enzyme on the cell surface are also thought to be regulated by internalisation on S-protein binding and by clustering in membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts. This chapter summarises the current understanding of how the cell biology of ACE2 is regulated and may influence and determine its function, and concludes by discussing the future challenges and opportunities for studies of this increasingly important enzyme.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lambert, Daniel W.","journal":"Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5f5548d325ef5f85f8381af17d05b97f6b94fed3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176163.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176163/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3MzU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell surface","cell biology of ACE2","important enzyme","transmembrane protein","SARS coronavirus","SARS-CoV","large catalytic extracellular domain","cellular receptor","current understanding","angiotensin system","viral receptor","identification of angiotensin","S-protein binding","clustering","membrane microdomains","heart","testes","lung","kidney","studies","pathophysiological roles","double life","opportunities","cells","renin","breathtaking advances","structure","metallopeptidase","gastrointestinal tract","lipid rafts","minor player","well-known homologue","future challenges","internalisation","type","peptidases","discovery","chapter","research","aspects","levels","activity","function"],"language":"en"},

The gastrointestinal tract, however, although also a target for SARS-CoV replication, is obviously not affected by cell death mechanisms. Such differences in cell death induction are paralleled by in-vitro studies. In a colon-derived cell line (Caco-2), proapoptotic proteins were down- and antiapoptotic proteins were upregulated during SARS-CoV infection. By contrast, in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells, apoptosis was induced via the p38 MAPK and caspase dependent pathways. Both apoptotic pathways, although mostly the intrinsic signal transduction, can be targeted by structural as well as accessory proteins of SARS-CoV. The fact that all structural and most of the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV are implicated in apoptotic scenarios indicates the fundamental role of apoptosis in the SARS-CoV life cycle. Interestingly, at least for the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, a cell-type specific manipulation of apoptosis was confirmed.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Diemer, Claudia; Schneider, Martha; Sch\u00E4tzl, Hermann M.; Gilch, Sabine","journal":"Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/93059925957cabaa9553fae274afe987df88b7fd.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176189.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176189/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3NDY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV replication","SARS-CoV infection","accessory proteins of SARS","SARS-CoV life cycle","SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells","organs of SARS coronavirus","nucleocapsid protein of SARS","cell death induction","types of cell death","cell death mechanisms","antiapoptotic proteins","proapoptotic proteins","cell-type specific manipulation of apoptosis","fundamental role of apoptosis","colon-derived cell line","apoptotic pathways","infected patients","apoptotic scenarios","caspase dependent pathways","Caco","p38 MAPK","necrosis","intrinsic signal transduction","differences","target","contrast","vitro studies","gastrointestinal tract","fact"],"language":"en"},

The decision to perform bronchoscopy and BAL should be guided by clinical presentation and the patient\u2019s status as well as local technical expertise, both in performing the procedure and in interpreting the results. An important problem with interpreting BAL results is the variability between centers, which highlights the importance of following standard protocols. There is a need for a consensus statement among experts to provide guidelines for the utility of BAL cellular analyses in clinical practice. A number of specific conditions, such as some rare diseases, malignancy, and infections, can be diagnosed by BAL analyses. In such cases, more invasive procedures can be avoided. Even when nondiagnostic, BAL cellular analysis usually adds valuable information to the clinical and radiological data and helps to narrow the differential diagnosis. On the other hand, the diagnostic usefulness of BAL in interstitial lung disease, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is limited. An important issue of BAL in this setting is exclusion of other diseases as sarcoidosis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. BAL is an invaluable research tool for ILD, providing information regarding immune effector cells that accumulate in the alveoli and their noncellular products. With the increasing availability of proteomics, the importance of biomarkers of ILD will hopefully become clear in the near future. It is essential that BAL findings be interpreted by experts in the context of clinical and radiological data.","publish_time":"2012-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stanzel, Franz","journal":"Principles and Practice of Interventional Pulmonology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3c27a4942b2fafa7390ef6fc4f811182ae4c5b2b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176194.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176194/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3NDg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["BAL","ILD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["BAL analyses","BAL findings","important issue of BAL","interpreting BAL results","diagnostic usefulness of BAL","BAL cellular analysis","utility of BAL cellular analyses","clinical presentation","context of clinical","clinical practice","ILD","experts","important role","rare diseases","important problem","infectious diseases","radiological data","diagnostic evaluation of interstitial lung disease","pulmonary infiltrates","valuable information","importance of biomarkers","invasive procedures","idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","guidelines","patient\u2019s status","setting","invaluable research tool","immune effector cells","alveoli","local technical expertise","consensus statement","sarcoidosis","infections","exclusion","variability","centers","increasing availability of proteomics","number of specific conditions","need","IPF","hypersensitivity pneumonitis","malignancy","nondiagnostic","hand","noncellular products","near future","cases","standard protocols","Bronchoalveolar lavage","decision","bronchoscopy","differential diagnosis"],"language":"en"},

A novel human coronavirus, named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), derived from SARS patients was reported as the etiologic agent of SARS. Studying the signaling pathways of SARS-infected cells is key to understanding the molecular mechanism of SARS viral infection. Cell death is observed in cultured Vero E6 cells after SARS-CoV infection. From SARS-CoV infection to cell death, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a key participant in the determination of cell death and survival. Two signaling pathways comprising signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) are downstream of p38 MAPK. AKT and JNK (Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase) signaling pathways are important to establish persistent infection of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. Expression studies of SARS-CoV proteins indicate that the viral proteins are able to activate signaling pathways of host cells. The study of signaling pathways in SARS-CoV patients is difficult to perform compared with in vitro studies due to the effects of the human immune system. This review highlights recent progress in characterizing signal transduction pathways in SARS-CoV-infected cells in vitro and in vivo.","publish_time":"2009-07-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mizutani, Tetsuya","journal":"Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/44cc0c439f8a62c15c6ee715f81a57ae85bfc863.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176218.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176218/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs3NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pathways of SARS","SARS-CoV infection","SARS coronavirus","SARS patients","SARS-CoV patients","persistent infection of SARS","Expression studies of SARS","etiologic agent of SARS","CoV proteins","molecular mechanism of SARS viral infection","pathways of host cells","infected cells","characterizing signal transduction pathways","cultured Vero E6 cells","determination of cell death","terminal kinase","viral proteins","p38 MAPK","novel human coronavirus","p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase","signal transducer","p90 ribosomal S6 kinase","key participant","respiratory illness","human immune system","Severe acute respiratory syndrome","review highlights recent progress","STAT3","p90RSK","activator of transcription","NH","effects","century","pandemic infectious disease","variable symptoms","survival","AKT","JNK","study"],"language":"en"},

Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S.E) has emerged as one of the most important food-borne pathogens. However, major studies still focus on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.

We found that AvrA regulates the conversion of LC3 I into LC3 II and the enrichment of lysosomes. Beclin-1, a key molecular regulator of autophagy, was decreased after AvrA expressed strain colonization. In S.E-AvrA(\u2212)-infected cells, we found the increases of protein levels of p-JNK and p-c-Jun and the transcription level of AP-1. AvrA-reduction of Beclin-1 protein expression is through the JNK pathway. The JNK inhibitor abolished the AvrA-reduced Beclin-1 protein expression. Moreover, we identified that the AvrA mutation C186A abolished its regulation of Beclin-1 expression. In addition AvrA protein was found interacted with Beclin-1. In organoids and infected mice, we explored the physiologically related effects and mechanism of AvrA in reducing Beclin-1 through the JNK pathway, thus attenuating autophagic responses. This finding not only indicates an important role of S. Enteritidis effector in reducing host protein as a strategy to suppress autophagy, but also suggests manipulating autophagy as a new strategy to treat infectious diseases.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Jiao, Yang; Zhang, Yong-guo; Lin, Zhijie; Lu, Rong; Xia, Yinglin; Meng, Chuang; Pan, Zhimin; Xu, Xiulong; Jiao, Xinan; Sun, Jun","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57bcbab3c93ca80f534e1c1c199aa6c1e568a6f8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7181453.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181453/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzIwLmNzdjs4NjQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":736797,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"YhJtmiBoiWudMmooKL/KIg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_20.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella","S.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using a nasopharyngeal sample, is the mainstay of diagnosis, but there is an ~30% false negative rate early in the disease and in patients with mild disease. RT-PCR positivity can persist for several days after a resolution of symptoms. IgM and IgG antibody responses become positive several days after the onset of symptoms, and robust antibody responses are detectable in the second week of illness. Antibody-based immunoassays have a limited role in the diagnosis of early symptomatic disease. However, their incremental benefit over RT-PCR in the first 2 weeks of illness is currently being clarified in ongoing studies. Such assays may be useful for surveillance purposes.

Given the impact of quarantine on resources and individual liberty, it is vital to assess under what conditions individual quarantine can more effectively control COVID-19 than active monitoring. As an epidemic grows, it is also important to consider when these interventions are no longer feasible, and broader mitigation measures must be implemented. Methods: To estimate the comparative efficacy of these case-based interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model to reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Specifically, we fit to the incubation period distribution and each of two sets of the serial interval distribution: a shorter one with a mean serial interval of 4.8 days and a longer one with a mean of 7.5 days. To assess variable resource settings, we consider two feasibility settings: a high feasibility setting with 90% of contacts traced, a half-day average delay in tracing and symptom recognition, and 90% effective isolation; and low feasibility setting with 50% of contacts traced, a two-day average delay, and 50% effective isolation. Findings: Our results suggest that individual quarantine in high feasibility settings where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined contains an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) 84% of the time. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. When resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to mitigation efforts. Interpretation: Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts. To the extent these interventions can be implemented they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","publish_time":"2020-03-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Peak, Corey M; Kahn, Rebecca; Grad, Yonatan H; Childs, Lauren M; Li, Ruoran; Lipsitch, Marc; Buckee, Caroline O","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3d337be8c78efe0412bc628a572e83c6ab223a9c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031088","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["individual quarantine of high-risk contacts","Voluntary individual quarantine","voluntary active monitoring of contacts","conditions individual quarantine","number of contacts","impact of quarantine","high feasibility settings","individual liberty","outbreak of COVID","serial interval distribution","mean serial interval","cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine","quarters of infected contacts","short serial interval","days","spread of COVID","low feasibility","scalable interventions","case-based interventions","effective isolation","variable resource settings","resources","core disease control strategies","two-day average delay","half-day average delay","mitigation efforts","extent of presymptomatic transmission","stochastic branching model","broader mitigation measures","incubation period distribution","data-driven policy decisions","emerging infectious diseases","order","tracing","symptom recognition","parameters","sets","social distancing","comparative efficacy","urgent need","results","Background","dynamics","performance","Methods","Interpretation","Findings","burden","epidemic","time"],"language":"en"},

To do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=52) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (n=53). The patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. The rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current National and WHO COVID-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (36%). When the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) and/ or lymphopenia. Thus, our analysis reveals that eosinopenia may be a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection than leukocyte counts and lymphopenia recommended by the current guidelines.","publish_time":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Qilin; Ding, Xiuli; Xia, Geqing; Geng, Zhi; Chen, Fenghua; Wang, Lin; Wang, Zheng","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/47b07518dc0f608e53198bb5f8a95caa1c164fe5.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.13.20022830","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs0ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["positive patients","negative patients","SARS-CoV","rates of patients","similar symptoms","decreased number of eosinophils","large number of COVID","total number of COVID","leukocyte counts","lymphopenia","respiratory symptoms","infection","rate of eosinopenia","cohorts","current guidelines","designated fever clinics","laboratory findings","reliable laboratory predictor","PCR","case-control study","line health-care workers","identification","parameters","outbreak","diagnosis sensitivity","Wuhan","combination","triage","specificity","China","differences","practical marker","analysis"],"language":"en"},

These samples can comprise hundreds of organisms that can be closely or very distantly related in the taxonomic tree of life. DNA metabarcoding combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), whereby a short, homologous sequence of DNA is amplified and sequenced from all members of the community. Sequences are then taxonomically identified based on their match to a reference database. Ideally, each species of interest would have a unique DNA barcode. This short, variable sequence needs to be flanked by relatively conserved regions that can be used as primer binding sites. Appropriate PCR primer pairs would match to a broad evolutionary range of taxa, such that we only need a few to achieve high taxonomic coverage. At the same time however, the DNA barcodes between primer pairs should be different to allow us to distinguish between species to improve resolution. This poses an interesting optimization problem. More specifically: Given a set of references \u211B = {R1, R2, \u2026, Rm}, the problem is to find a primer set P balancing both: high taxonomic coverage and high resolution. This goal can be captured by filtering for frequent primers and ranking by coverage or variation, i.e. the number of unique barcodes. Here we present the software PriSeT, an offline primer discovery tool that is capable of processing large libraries and is robust against mislabeled or low quality references. It tackles the computationally expensive steps with linear runtime filters and efficient encodings. Results We first evaluated PriSeT on references (mostly 18S rRNA genes) from 19 clades covering eukaryotic organisms that are typical for freshwater plankton samples. PriSeT recovered several published primer sets as well as additional, more chemically suitable primer sets. For these new sets, we compared frequency, taxon coverage, and amplicon variation with published primer sets. For 11 clades we found de novo primer pairs that cover more taxa than the published ones, and for six clades de novo primers resulted in greater sequence (i.e., DNA barcode) variation. We also applied PriSeT to 19 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and computed 114 new primer pairs with the additional constraint that the sequences have no co-occurrences in other taxa. These primer sets would be suitable for empirical testing.

Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, what could be due to a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists, from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation of their countries, existing myths and misinformation, and the possible resources available. They were also asked to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CF\u2019s were prepared based on the extant literature and the views expressed; they illustrate the epidemiology of MH issues, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans/innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and probable outcomes at policy level. This CF can serve as a technical guide for future research in pandemic. It can be used to monitor trends and to optimize efforts and to develop evidence based MH interventions. However further research focusing on the individual components of this framework is needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ransing, Ramdas; Adiukwu, Frances; Pereira-Sanchez, Victor; Ramalho, Rodrigo; Orsolini, Laura; Schuh Teixeira, Andr\u00E9 Luiz; Gonzalez-Diaz, Jairo M.; da Costa, Mariana Pinto; Soler-Vidal, Joan; Byty\u00E7i, Drita Gashi; El Hayek, Samer; Larnaout, Amine; Shalbafan, Mohammadreza; Syarif, Zulvia; Nofal, Marwa; Kundadak, Ganesh Kudva","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a26405a36f2509bbf65b307d05f45b189afb1276.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876201820301969; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876201820301969?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs1MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MH"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MH care","evaluation of MH interventions","related MH problems","epidemiology of MH issues","current MH situation","epidemiology of pandemic","preparedness plans","countries","potential interventions","little evidence","views","stage-specific plans","innovative solutions","future research","technical guide","complexities of pandemics","Little attention","conceptual framework","affordable care","misinformation","opportunities","existing myths","probable outcomes","ongoing COVID","policy level","early career psychiatrists","implementation","emergence of mental health","lack of replicable","applicable frameworks","possible resources available","semi-structured questionnaire","opinions","topic","policymakers","stakeholders","researchers","development","individual components","efforts","extant literature","CF\u2019s","trends","regions","response"],"language":"en"},

The ability to recognize and potentially intervene early in those patients at greatest risk of developing this complication could be of great clinical utility. Methods: We performed detailed flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples from 28 COVID-19 patients treated at Xian No.8 Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Xian Jiaotong University in early 2020 in an attempt to identify factors that could help predict severity of disease and patient outcome. Findings: While we did not detect significant differences in the number of monocytes between patients with COVID-19 and normal healthy individuals,we did identify significant morphological and functional differences, which are more pronounced in patients requiring prolonged hospitalization and ICU admission. Patients with COVID-19 have larger than normal monocytes, easily identified on forward scatter, side scatter analysis by routine flow cytometry,with the presence of a distinct population of monocytes with high forward scatter (FSC-high).

Effective prioritization of these measures can be determined by understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses of three parameters: (i) secondary attack rate (SAR) in various settings, (ii) clinical onset serial interval (SI), and (iii) the proportion of asymptomatic infection. Methods and Findings We searched PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases between January 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, for articles describing SARS-CoV-2 attack rate, SI, and asymptomatic infection. Studies were included if they presented original data for estimating point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the three parameters. Random effects models were constructed to pool SAR, mean SI, and asymptomatic proportion. Risk ratios were used to examine differences in transmission risk by setting, type of contact, and symptom status of the index case. Publication and related bias were assessed by funnel plots and Egger\u0027s meta-regression test for small-study effects. Our search strategy for SAR, SI, and asymptomatic infection identified 459, 572, and 1624 studies respectively. Of these, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria for SAR, 18 studies for SI, and 66 studies for asymptomatic infection. We estimated the pooled household SAR at 15.4% (95% CI: 12.2%, 18.7%) compared to 4.0% (95% CI: 2.8%, 5.2%) in non-household settings. We observed variation across settings; however, the small number of studies limited power to detect associations and sources of heterogeneity. SAR of symptomatic index cases is significantly higher than cases that were symptom-free at diagnosis (RR 2.55, 95% CI: 1.47, 4.45). Adults appear to be more susceptible to transmission than children (RR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.96). The pooled mean SI is estimated at 4.87 days (95% CI: 3.98, 5.77). The pooled proportion of cases who had no symptoms at diagnosis is 25.9% (95% CI: 18.8%, 33.1%). Conclusions Based our pooled estimates, 10 infected symptomatic persons living with 100 contacts would result in 15 additional cases in \u003C5 days. To be effective, quarantine of contacts should occur within 3 days of symptom onset. If testing and tracing relies on symptoms, one-quarter of cases would be missed. As such, while aggressive contact tracing strategies may be appropriate early in an outbreak, as it progresses, control measures should transition to account for SAR variability across settings. Targeted strategies focusing on high-density enclosed settings may be effective without overly restricting social movement.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Koh, W.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19: a public health emergency of international concern. Having into consideration the lockdown and quarantine situation, we decided to do evaluate the current emotional state on the general population with a web-based survey in English and in Spanish, which was considered a useful and fast method that could help us determine how people perceived stress and worry due to the COVID-19. Methods: The survey included a 22 items, gathering information in 3 sections: Sociodemographic data, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) by Cohen and additional queries that assessed the current worry and change of behaviours due to this pandemic. Results: The survey received 891 respondents from 25 countries, from March 17 to 23rd, 2020. The mean age of the respondents was 43.8 (14.2) years old, and more than two thirds were women. 12.8% were health personnel.The mean of the PSS-10 score was 17.4 (6.4). Significantly higher scores were observed among women, youth, students, and among those who expressed concern and those who perceived increased susceptibility to the COVID-19. In contrast, no significant differences were observed between the health professionals and the general population. A good correlation was observed between mean relative volume (RSV) of the las 14 days and the number of cases reported (rho = 0.68, p \u003C0.001) and deaths (rho = 0.51, p \u003C0.001). Discussion: With these results we describe an increase of affective symptoms due to the COVID-19. This pandemic is raising the anxiety levels. The findings of our study show the affective and cognitive alterations people are going through. This survey is the first attempt to measure the psychological consequences this pandemic is having, in order to be able to later be able to provide the support to confront this global issue, addressing the mental health care that will be needed.","publish_time":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Limcaoco, R.

Based on a comprehensive structural analysis of S proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and previous human coronaviruses, we found that the protomer state of S proteins is structurally flexible.

Abstract Hundred viruses can be isolated in patients suffering from respiratory virus infections and hospitalised in intensive care unit (ICU): influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, para-influenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus\u2026 Nasal or tracheobronchial specimens, which contain many epithelial cells will be used to isolate these common viruses. In immunocompromised patients a bronchoalveolar lavage has to be added to these specimens in order to detect cytomegalovirus and some adenovirus. The immunofluorescence or immunoenzymatic assays, which detect viral antigens in the infected cells are the easiest and fastest diagnostic methods, theoretically. As with other techniques, specimen quality is a major determinant of their performance. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of the antigen detection assays is low in respiratory infections in adults. Then the virus recovery by cell culture, which is usually more sensitive than the antigen detection assays, can be helpful. Many studies have reported more respiratory virus detections using nucleic acid testing such as PCR. They detect viruses, which are missed by conventional methods and increase the detection of common respiratory virus. Multiplex PCR assays have been developed, and these can simultaneously detect several viruses directly in clinical specimens. Nucleic acid testing can subtype viruses using subtype-specific primers, and analyse strain variation through genetic. It can be used also to quantify the viral load in clinical specimens. More recently real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed to get more rapidly the results of the nucleic acids assays. Specimen quality, timing and transportation conditions may be less critical for nucleic acid testing than for culture or antigen detection, as viable virus and intact infected cells need not to be preserved. Moreover, viral nucleic acids are detectable for several days longer into the clinical course than is cultivable virus, potentially allowing a diagnosis to be made in late-presenting patients. However, in a clinical virology laboratory, where the speed, low cost, and high sensitivity of the methods are required, the sequential use of antigen detection tests and multiplex PCR could be the best choice, particularly in the clinical setting of respiratory virus infections in adults hospitalised in ICU. In the future, the development of real-time multiplex PCR is likely to be top-priority.","publish_time":"2007-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Freymuth, F.; Vabret, A.; Dina, J.; Daubin, C.; Gouarin, S.; Petitjean, J.; Charbonneau, P.","journal":"R\u00E9animation","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6395ff0ce502ecf1c36e374d37f9d4a1b32fda45.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1624069307000308; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1624069307000308","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["However"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus influenza","virus infectieux","respiratory syncytial virus","common respiratory virus","virus para-influenza","para-influenza virus","virus respiratoire syncytial","Then the virus recovery","isolement des virus classiques","PCR multiplex","centaines de virus respiratoires diff\u00E9rents","Multiplex PCR assays","techniques de diagnostic","techniques multiplex","the easiest","the sensitivity","m\u00E9thodes PCR","In immunocompromised patients","Abstract Hundred viruses can be isolated in patients suffering from respiratory virus infections","the antigen detection assays is low in respiratory infections in adults","increase the detection","techniques conventionnelles","reported more respiratory virus detections using nucleic acid testing such as PCR","which detect viral antigens in the infected cells","simplicit\u00E9 des techniques","The immunofluorescence or immunoenzymatic assays","to be added to these specimens in order to detect cytomegalovirus","They detect viruses","these can simultaneously detect several viruses directly in clinical specimens","can be helpful","which is usually more sensitive than the antigen detection assays","hospitalised in intensive care","Nucleic acid testing can subtype viruses using subtype","patients atteints","infections respiratoires","patients immunod\u00E9prim\u00E9s","As with other techniques","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vement nasal","recherche virale","which contain many epithelial cells will be used to isolate these common viruses","fastest diagnostic methods","infection virale respiratoire","charge virale respiratoire","tracheobronchial specimens","cell culture","rhinovirus","coronavirus","temps r\u00E9el","bocavirus","cellules infect\u00E9es","transport du pr\u00E9l\u00E8vement","qualit\u00E9 du pr\u00E9l\u00E8vement","cellules \u00E9pith\u00E9liales","raison","ad\u00E9novirus","efficacit\u00E9","specimen quality is","Many studies","bronchoalveolar lavage","conventional methods","some adenovirus","lavage bronchoalv\u00E9olaire","r\u00E9sultat rapide","types viraux","\u00E9vidence d\u0027antig\u00E8nes viraux","specific primers","missed","ICU","developed","major determinant","human metapneumovirus","ent\u00E9rovirus","enterovirus","trach\u00E9obronchique","analyse strain variation through genetic","service de r\u00E9animation","m\u00E9tapneumovirus humain","rapidit\u00E9","s\u00E9quen\u00E7age","souches","exigences prioritaires","technique immunoenzymatique","their performance","co\u00FBt mod\u00E9r\u00E9","priorit\u00E9 majeure","r\u00E9ponse tardive","th\u00E9orie","theoretically","recherches virales","d\u00E9veloppement des outils","Unfortunately","meilleur choix","laboratoire de virologie clinique","variabilit\u00E9 g\u00E9n\u00E9tique","futur","cas","cytom\u00E9galovirus","pr\u00E9l\u00E8vements","richesse","adulte","In the future","the development","the sequential","the methods","particularly in the clinical setting","the nucleic acids assays","where the speed","diagnosis to be","to be preserved","in late","multiplex PCR could be the best choice","It can be used also to quantify the viral load in clinical specimens","developed to get more rapidly the results","into the clinical course than is cultivable virus","respiratory virus infections in adults hospitalised in ICU","real-time multiplex PCR is likely to be top","PCR assays","viral nucleic acids","clinical virology laboratory","transportation conditions may be less critical","nucleic acid testing than","as viable virus","antigen detection tests","More recently real-time RT","culture or antigen detection","several days","potentially allowing","intact infected cells need","detectable","timing","low cost","required","high sensitivity","priority","Specimen quality","presenting patients"],"language":"fr"},

During the interval between February 19 and 23, 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases with eight deaths. Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting a underlying burden of disease in that country than is indicated by reported cases. A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19. We sought to estimate COVID-19 outbreak size in Iran based on known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in Iran may spread to next. We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using using International Air Transport Association (IATA) data. We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic that would result in cases being observed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada. Time at risk estimates were based on a presumed 6 week epidemic age, and length of stay data for visitors to Iran derived from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination country rankings on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . Scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. UAE, Lebanon, and Canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from Iran in February 2019. We estimated that 18,300 (95% confidence interval: 3770 to 53,470) COVID-19 cases would have had to occur in Iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these three internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing. Results were robust under varying assumptions about undiagnosed case numbers in Syria, Azerbaijan and Iraq. Even if it were assumed that all cases were identified in all countries with certainty, the \u0022best case\u0022 outbreak size was substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases), and far higher than reported case counts. Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics.","publish_time":"2020-02-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tuite, Ashleigh R.; Bogoch, Isaac; Sherbo, Ryan; Watts, Alexander; Fisman, David N.; Khan, Kamran","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ffbd7555a337706238c211197b221795e4e35146.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027375","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["International Air Transport Association","United Arab Emirates","UAE","United Nations World Tourism Organization"],"locations":["China","Canada","Lebanon","Syria","Iraq","Iran"],"keyphrases":["Iran","exported cases","identified cases of COVID","underlying epidemic","infectious disease outbreak","outbreak size","epidemic of significant size","neighbouring countries","large epidemic","air travel links","case counts","global dissemination of COVID","Canada","week epidemic age","best case","low volumes of air travel","outbound air travel volume","Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index","infectious outbreaks","Coronavirus Disease","outbreak duration","time of writing","strength of travel links","underlying burden of disease","undiagnosed case numbers","lower capacity","destination country rankings","greater capacity","infectious diseases epidemics","data","UAE","Lebanon","higher scores","International Air Transport Association","outward dissemination","risk estimates","Scores range","confidence interval","United Arab Emirates","United Nations World Tourism Organization","varying assumptions","Syria","IDVI","UNWTO","Azerbaijan","IATA","length","high likelihood","months","visitors","origin","validated metric","Results","Iraq","Wuhan","China","relationship","order","exportations","certainty","public health","infections","interconnectivity","methods of Fraser","deaths"],"language":"en"},

Decisions surrounding surveillance design parameters, such as the number and placement of surveillance sites, target populations, and case definitions, are often determined by expert opinion or deference to operational considerations, without formal analysis of the influence of design parameters on surveillance objectives. Here we propose a simulation framework to guide evidence-based surveillance network design to better achieve specific surveillance goals with limited resources. We define evidence-based surveillance design as a constrained, multi-dimensional, multi-objective, dynamic optimization problem, acknowledging the many operational constraints under which surveillance systems operate, the many dimensions of surveillance system design, the multiple and competing goals of surveillance, and the complex and dynamic nature of disease systems. We describe an analytical framework for the identification of optimal designs through mathematical representations of disease and surveillance processes, definition of objective functions, and the approach to numerical optimization. We then apply the framework to the problem of selecting candidate sites to expand an existing surveillance network under alternative objectives of: (1) improving spatial prediction of disease prevalence at unmonitored sites; or (2) estimating the observed effect of a risk factor on disease. Results of this demonstration illustrate how optimal designs are sensitive to both surveillance goals and the underlying spatial pattern of the target disease. The findings affirm the value of designing surveillance systems through quantitative and adaptive analysis of network characteristics and performance. The framework can be applied to the design of surveillance systems tailored to setting-specific disease transmission dynamics and surveillance needs, and can yield improved understanding of tradeoffs between network architectures.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheng, Qu; Collender, Philip A.; Heaney, Alexandra K.; Li, Xintong; Dasan, Rohini; Li, Charles; Lewnard, Joseph; Zelner, Jon; Liang, Song; Chang, Howard H.; Waller, Lance A.; Lopman, Benjamin A.; Yang, Changhong; Remais, Justin V.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57d42952a44eb0796f888a054af7c73ba71763ff.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20048231","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs2NDM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["surveillance objectives","design of surveillance systems","surveillance needs","surveillance processes","surveillance networks","surveillance design parameters","Infectious disease surveillance systems","specific surveillance goals","existing surveillance network","competing goals of surveillance","placement of surveillance sites","evidence-based surveillance design","dimensions of surveillance system design","evidence-based surveillance network design","target disease","dynamic nature of disease systems","guiding disease prevention","mathematical representations of disease","specific disease transmission dynamics","spatial prediction of disease prevalence","influence of design parameters","network architectures","analytical framework","simulation framework","multi-objective","adaptive analysis of network characteristics","unmonitored sites","candidate sites","dynamic optimization problem","identification of optimal designs","formal analysis","operational considerations","target populations","operational constraints","alternative objectives","numerical optimization","definition of objective functions","underlying spatial pattern","vital data","control policies","deference","improved understanding of tradeoffs","number","expert opinion","formalization of methods","case definitions","approach","demonstration","risk factor","performance","value","limited resources","observed effect","Decisions","Results","findings"],"language":"en"},

Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants.

Here, we successfully developed a SARS-CoV-2 hACE2 transgenic mouse (HFH4-hACE2 in C3B6 mice) infection model. The infected mice generated typical interstitial pneumonia and pathology that were similar to those of COVID-19 patients. Viral quantification revealed the lungs as the major site of infection, although viral RNA could also be found in the eye, heart, and brain in some mice. Virus identical to SARS-CoV-2 in full-genome sequences was isolated from the infected lung and brain tissues.

Whether antibodies are important for the adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be determined. Here, 26 cases of COVID-19 in Jinan, China, were examined and shown to be mild or with common clinical symptoms and no cases of severe symptoms were found among these patients. A striking feature of some patients is that SARS-CoV-2 could exist in patients who have virus-specific IgG antibodies for a very long period, with one case for up to 36 days. One COVID-19 patient who did not produce any SARS-CoV-2-bound IgG successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2 after 46 days of illness, revealing that without antibody-mediated adaptive immunity, innate immunity may still be powerful enough to eliminate SARS-CoV-2. Overall, this report may provide a basis for further analysis of both innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2 clearance, especially in non-severe cases. This study also has implications for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","publish_time":"2020-04-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, B.; Wang, L.; Kong, X.; Geng, J.; Xiao, D.; Ma, C.; Jiang, X.; Wang, P.-H.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.13.20040980v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs3MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV","treatment of SARS","adaptive immunity","patients","cases of severe symptoms","innate immunity","cases of COVID","non-severe cases","infection","adaptive immune responses","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","coronavirus disease","bound IgG","virus-specific IgG antibodies","days of illness","common clinical symptoms","clearance","long period","antibody","analysis","pathogenesis","implications","basis","Jinan","striking feature","China","study","report"],"language":"en"},

Population age distributions and prior morbidities differ markedly in these countries from those where large outbreaks have become established previously. We determined to predict likely impact of COVID-19 and the response on the Ugandan population, measure and compare these appropriately, to understand whether the benefits of the response could be outweighed by the costs. Design and setting We applied age-based COVID-19 mortality data from China to the population structures of Uganda and countries with previously established outbreaks, comparing theoretical mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. Based on recent Uganda health system data and on theoretical scenarios of program deterioration, we predicted potential mortality and DALYs lost for HIV/AIDS, malaria and maternal. Main outcome measures Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost, mortality. Results Based on population age structure alone, Uganda is predicted to have a relatively low COVID-19 burden, with 12% of the mortality and 19% of the lost DALYs predicted for equivalent transmission in the Italian population. Scenarios of lockdown impact predict comparable or higher burdens from HIV or malaria alone to that of an extensive COVID-19 outbreak. Emerging disease data presented from Uganda, including HIV case finding and maternal mortality, suggest early signs that such deterioration could be occurring. Conclusions The results indicate that COVID-19 impact on Uganda may be relatively light, while there is a high risk of a significant negative impact on other disease burden if the lockdown response to COVID-19 is prolonged. The results are likely to extend to other sub-Saharan populations, underlining the importance of tailoring COVID-19 responses according to population structure and potential disease vulnerabilities.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"BELL, D.; Schultz Hansen, K.; Kiragga, A.

The molecular mechanisms underlying these disparate outcomes are currently unknown. Glycosylation within the human host plays a critical role in influenza virus biology. However, the impact these modifications have on the severity of influenza disease has not been examined. Herein, we profile the glycomic host responses to influenza virus infection as a function of disease severity using a ferret model and our lectin microarray technology. We identify the glycan epitope high mannose as a marker of influenza virus-induced pathogenesis and severity of disease outcome. Induction of high mannose is dependent upon the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, a pathway previously shown to associate with lung damage and severity of influenza virus infection. Also, the mannan-binding lectin (MBL2), an innate immune lectin that negatively impacts influenza outcomes, recognizes influenza virus-infected cells in a high mannose dependent manner. Together, our data argue that the high mannose motif is an infection-associated molecular pattern on host cells that may guide immune responses leading to the concomitant damage associated with severity. SIGNIFICANCE Influenza virus infection causes a range of outcomes from mild illness to death. The molecular mechanisms leading to these differential host responses are currently unknown. Herein, we identify the induction of high mannose, a glycan epitope, as a key mediator of severe disease outcome. We propose a mechanism in which activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) upon influenza virus infection turns on expression of high mannose, which is then recognized by the innate immune lectin MBL2, activating the complement cascade and leading to subsequent inflammation. This work is the first to systematically study host glycomic changes in response to influenza virus infection, identifying high mannose as a key feature of differential host response.","publish_time":"2020-04-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Heindel, Daniel W.; Koppolu, Sujeethraj; Zhang, Yue; Kasper, Brian; Meche, Lawrence; Vaiana, Christopher; Bissel, Stephanie J.; Carter, Chalise E.; Kelvin, Alyson A.; Zhang, Bin; Zhou, Bin; Chou, Tsui-Wen; Lashua, Lauren; Ross, Ted M.; Ghedin, Elodie; Mahal, Lara K.","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e6218bc44d36a0a5c76d854181857170d071b1c2.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.21.054098","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["severity of influenza virus infection","influenza outcomes","Influenza virus infections","influenza virus biology","severity of influenza disease","SIGNIFICANCE Influenza virus infection","influenza virus-infected cells","Induction of high mannose","high mannose motif","expression of high mannose","marker of influenza virus-induced pathogenesis","glycan epitope high mannose","high mannose dependent manner","host cells","severity of disease outcome","differential host responses","glycomic host responses","function of disease severity","human host","mild disease","key feature of differential host response","host glycomic changes","immune responses","innate immune lectin MBL2","unfolded protein response","range of outcomes","disparate outcomes","molecular mechanisms","key mediator of severe disease outcome","wide variety of outcomes","UPR","lectin microarray technology","mannan-binding lectin","pathway","mild illness","molecular pattern","cases of severe illness","lung damage","concomitant damage","ferret model","critical role","complement cascade","activation","subsequent inflammation","modifications","data","impact","Glycosylation","deaths","work"],"language":"en"},

An increasing number of evidence indicate a relatively high prevalence of superinfections associated with COVID-19, including invasive aspergillosis, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be characterized. In the present study, to better understand the biological impact of superinfection we sought to determine and compare the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 versus Aspergillus superinfection, using a model of reconstituted humain airway epithelium. Our analyses reveal that both simple infection and superinfection induce a strong deregulation of core components of innate immune and inflammatory responses, with a stronger response to superinfection in the bronchial epithelial model compared to its nasal counterpart. Our results also highlight unique transcriptional footprints of SARS-CoV-2 Aspergillus superinfection, such as an imbalanced type I/type III IFN, and an induction of several monocyte- and neutrophil associated chemokines, that could be useful for the understanding of Aspergillus-associated COVID-19 and but also management of severe forms of aspergillosis in this specific context.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"de Lamballerie, Claire Nicolas; Pizzorno, Andr\u00E9s; Fouret, Julien; Szpiro, Lea; Padey, Blandine; Dubois, Julia; Julien, Thomas; Traversier, Aur\u00E9lien; Duli\u00E8re, Victoria; Brun, Pauline; Lina, Bruno; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Terrier, Olivier","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f5b0bcbcf793a5ae64cd098c88138e1896a3b324.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.103630","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4MTc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Aspergillus superinfection","associated COVID","biological impact of superinfection","SARS-CoV","understanding of Aspergillus","host transcriptional response","neutrophil associated chemokines","stronger response","unique transcriptional footprints of SARS","invasive aspergillosis","imbalanced type","Superinfections of bacterial","bronchial epithelial model","high prevalence of superinfections","management of severe forms of aspergillosis","model of reconstituted humain airway epithelium","strong deregulation of core components of innate immune","inflammatory responses","course","simple infection","severity of respiratory viral infections","induction","monocyte","IFN","fungal origin","specific context","nasal counterpart","increasing number of evidence","underlying mechanisms","results","analyses","present study"],"language":"en"},

Since the reported cases are typically only a fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, the model accounts for both reported and unreported cases. Also, the model allows for the time variation of both the transmission rate and the fraction of asymptomatic infectious that become reported symptomatic individuals, so as to reflect public health interventions, towards its control, along the course of the epidemic evolution. An analytical exponential behaviour for the accumulated reported cases evolution is assumed at the onset of the epidemy, for explicitly estimating initial conditions, while a Bayesian inference approach is adopted for parametric estimations employing the present direct problem model with the data from the known portion of the epidemics evolution, represented by the time series for the reported cases of infected individuals. The direct-inverse problem analysis is then employed with the actual data from China, with the first half been employed for the parametric estimation and the second half for validation of the predictive capability of the proposed approach. The full dataset for China is then employed in another parameter identification, including the average times that asymptomatic infectious individuals and that symptomatic individuals are infectious. Following this validation, the available data on reported cases in Brasil from February 15th till March 29th, 2020, is used for estimating parameters and then predict the epidemy evolution under these conditions. Finally, public health interventions are simulated, aimed at diminishing the effects of the disease spreading, by acting on both the transmission rate and the fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals, considering time variable exponential behaviours for these two parameters, usually assumed constant in epidemic evolutions without intervention. It is demonstrated that a combination of actions to affect both parameters can have a much faster and effective result in the control of the epidemy dynamics.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cotta, Renato Machado; Naveira-Cotta, Carolina Palma; magal, pierre","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/92acb561ba0ebfbeb8efb529279ae659dcd9a548.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.31.20049130","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs4NDE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["reported symptomatic individuals","asymptomatic infectious individuals","reported cases of infected individuals","infectious disease","accumulated reported cases evolution","fraction of asymptomatic infectious","epidemy evolution","control","unreported cases","public health interventions","model accounts","epidemics evolution","estimating parameters","present direct problem model","SIRU-type epidemic model","total number","time series","time variation","available data","half","actual data","transmission rate","epidemic evolutions","validation","influence of public health measures","epidemy dynamics","Brasil","proposed approach","China","time variable exponential behaviours","parametric estimations","direct-inverse problem analysis","initial conditions","assumed constant","analytical exponential behaviour","Bayesian inference approach","average times","predictive capability","known portion","parameter identification","effective result","course","onset","prediction of COVID","combination of actions","effects","dataset"],"language":"en"},

However, since the 1950s with the advent of precise and accurate analytical techniques, aided by fast computers, geochemists have been able to establish the link between geologic environment and incidence of disease in populations. Medical geology experienced a resurgence around the 1960s, leading to establishment of professional medical geology organizations, specialized courses at universities and colleges, national and international conferences, publication of textbooks, journals, and atlases. This article presents a historical review of medical geology, its evolution, scope and future prospects. Basic principles of medical geology are described and examples of various trace elements on human, and animal health presented. The role of clays in healing and ingestion of clays by humans and animals is examined.

Available evidence is limited to a few retrospective observational studies with small number of patients. Methods: We did a meta-analysis to assess the effect of ACEi/ARB in patients with COVID-19 on severity of disease, risk for hospitalisation, and death compared to those not on ACEi/ARB. We searched the Cochrane library, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrial.gov and medRxiv for studies published until 21.04.2020. Inclusion criteria included all studies with patients with confirmed COVID-19 either taking, or not taking, ACEi/ARB. Depending on degree of heterogeneity, fixed or random effect model was selected to calculate effect size (Odds ratio). Findings: Five studies were eligible for meta-analysis. These included 308 patients on ACEi/ARB, and 1172 not on ACEi/ARB. Compared to patients with COVID-19 not on ACEi/ARB, there was a statistically significant 44% reduction in odds of developing severe disease (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.34-1.89, I2=68.15), and 62% reduction in odds of death (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.19-0.74, I2=0.000) in those on ACEi/ARB. There was a non-significant 19% (OR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.42-1.55, I2: 0.000) reduction in odds of hospitalisation among those on ACEi/ARB. Interpretation: It is safe to use ACEi/ARB in patients with COVID-19 requiring these medications for associated comorbidities. Although limited by confounding factors typical of a meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies, our data suggests that use of these medications may reduce risk of developing severe disease and death.

We aimed to describe and analyse the clinical course, multi-strategy management, and respiratory support usage for the severe COVID-19 at the provincial level. Methods Using data from Sichuan Provincial Department of Health and the population-based multicentre cohort study, all microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 patients in Sichuan who met the national severe criteria were included from January 16 to March 15, 2020. All patients were followed-up from the day of inclusion, noted as Day one (D1), until discharge, death, or the end of the study. Findings Out of 539 COVID-19 patients, 81 severe cases (15.0%) were identified. The median (IQR) age was 50 (39-65) years, 37% were female, and 53.1% had chronic comorbidities. All severe cases were identified before requiring mechanical ventilation. Among the five predefined criteria for severe illness, low PaO2:FiO2 ratio (\u003C300 mmHg) was the most commonly reported, accounting for 87.7% of the severe diagnosed. By establishing provisional ICUs, all 81 patients were admitted to hospitals capable of providing critical care, among whom 51 (63.0%) were treated in provisional ICUs. On D1, 77 patients (95.1%) were admitted, 76 (93.8%) were administered by respiratory support, including 51 (67.9%) by conventional oxygen therapy (COT). By D28, 53 (65.4%) were discharged, three (3.7%) were deceased, and 25 (30.9%) were still hospitalized. COT, administered to 95.1% of the patients, was the most commonly used respiratory support and met 62.7% of the respiratory support needed, followed by high-flow nasal cannula (19.5%) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (10%). Interpretation The multi-strategy management for severe COVID-19 patients included early identification and timely critical care, including appropriate respiratory support in particular.

We developed a modified SEIR model, including confinement, asymptomatic transmission, quarantine and hospitalization. The population is subdivided into 9 age groups, resulting in a system of 72 coupled nonlinear differential equations. The rate of transmission is dynamic and derived from the observed delayed fatality rate; the parameters of the epidemics are derived with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We used Brazil as an example of middle income country, but the results are easily generalizable to other countries considering a similar strategy. We find that starting from 60% horizontal confinement, an exit strategy on May 1st of confinement of individuals older than 60 years old and full release of the younger population results in 400 000 hospitalizations, 50 000 ICU cases, and 120 000 deaths in the 50-60 years old age group alone. The health care system avoids collapse if the 50-60 years old are also confined, but our model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from contamination, so our numbers are a conservative lower bound. Our results discourage confinement by age as an exit strategy.","publish_time":"2020-04-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lyra, Wladimir; do Nascimento, Jose Dias; Belkhiria, Jaber; de Almeida, Leandro; Chrispim, Pedro Paulo; de Andrade, Ion","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c502d33d10bf1558e480d0ca3be97a81a373fbad.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20060053","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MTE1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil"],"keyphrases":["exit strategy","strategy of vertical confinement","age groups","similar strategy","horizontal confinement","years old age group","confinement of individuals older","middle income countries","epidemics","health care system capacity","specific groups","younger population results","rate of transmission","example of middle income country","ICU cases","number of cases","asymptomatic transmission","current lockdown","idealized lockdown","modified SEIR model","observed delayed fatality rate","particular challenge","increased risk of severe disease","SARS-CoV","parameters","ability","hospitalizations","release","Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm","numbers","quarantine","terms","collapse","nonlinear differential equations","Brazil","deaths","scenario","contact","ongoing COVID","infection","contamination","feasibility"],"language":"en"},

Interventions: Screening and management of patients using a hospital-specific protocol, which included fever triage, monitoring visitors and patients, emergency response, personnel training for healthcare team members, health education for patients and family, medical materials management, disinfection and wastes disposal protocols. Results: Between 23 January and 28 February 2020, 73 people were identified as having fever plus respiratory signs with/without a history of exposure and were tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by our hospital lab using RT PCR. Forty-five of these 73 people were subsequently excluded based on one negative RT PCR result plus positive results to quick screening tests for flu or other respiratory viruses. The remaining 28 people received a second RT PCR test 24 h later. Three people were confirmed positive for COVID-19 based on two consecutive positive RT PCR tests whilst 25 people were excluded based on two consecutive negative tests. The three COVID-19 confirmed cases received non-critical care. There were no new infections of medical staff or new infections of other hospital inpatients. Conclusions: All three cases were detected as a result of vigilant monitoring of hospital visitors. Whilst screening out-patients presenting to a fever clinic remains important, monitoring visitors must not be overlooked.","publish_time":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pu, Hong; Xu, Yujun; Doig, Gordon S.; Zhou, Yan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1f56fcb46c69a19f049da03321feba27fca39715.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20038679","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5MTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RT","PCR","RT PCR"],"locations":["Chengdu","China"],"keyphrases":["hospital inpatients","people","hospital lab","hospital-specific protocol","COVID","result of vigilant monitoring of hospital visitors","management of patients","consecutive positive RT PCR tests","negative RT PCR result","quick screening tests","bed tertiary care teaching hospital","positive results","experiences screening","confirmed cases","consecutive negative tests","fever triage","fever clinic","respiratory signs","respiratory viruses","new infections of medical staff","medical materials management","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","novel coronavirus","non-critical care","healthcare team members","personnel training","disinfection","health education","Chengdu","family","emergency response","flu","wastes disposal protocols","Sichuan","disease","SARS-CoV","concerns","Design","Longitudinal cohort study","Setting","adults","China","Interventions","history of exposure","Objectives","Participants","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Setting: Between 14 and 24 April 2020 we tested 161 staff at four locations: our cancer centres in Reading - Berkshire, Newport - S Wales, Liverpool - Merseyside, and Bedlington in Northumberland. Participants: Testing was available to all staff who were on site at the four locations named above at the time the study was carried out. 161 staff (80 men, 81 women) gave voluntary consent to have the tests and all testing gave rise to valid results. Interventions: We used the South Korean test for antibodies to SARS CoV-2: Sugentech SGTi-flex COVID-19 IgM/IgG1. For each test, blood was collected and added to the sample well of the test cassette and buffer solution added. The test result was legible after 15 minutes.

These extreme measures are associated with extraordinary economic costs. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of global isolation of the whole population to focused isolation of individuals at high risk of being exposed, augmented by thorough PCR testing. Design: We applied a modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model to compare two different strategies in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 spread. Data sources and target population: We modeled the dynamics in Israel, a small country with ~ 9 million people. Time horizon: 200 days. Interventions: 1. Global isolation of the whole population (strategy 1) 2. Focused isolation of people at high risk of exposure with extensive PCR testing (strategy 2). Outcome measures: Number of deaths and the cost per one avoided death in strategy 1 vs 2. Results of Base-Case analysis: The number of expected deaths is 389 in strategy 1 versus 432 in strategy 2. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in case of adhering to global isolation will be $ 102,383,282 to prevent one case of death. Results of sensitivity analysis: The ICER value is between $ 22.5 million to over $280 million per one avoided death. Conclusions: According to our model, global isolation will save ~43 more lives compared to a strategy of focused isolation and extensive screening. This benefit is implicated in tremendous costs that might result in overwhelming economic effects. Limitations: Compartment models do not necessarily fit to countries with heterogeneous populations. In addition, we rely on current published parameters that might not reliably reflect infection dynamics.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shlomai, A.; Leshno, A.; Sklan, E.

As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number Ro -- the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of Ro vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Here, we present a novel statistical framework for comparing and combining different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models by decomposing the basic reproductive number into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate $r$, the mean generation interval $\\bar G$, and the generation-interval dispersion $\\kappa$. We then apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We show that many early Ro estimates are overly confident. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of Ro, including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate Ro at the outset of an epidemic.","publish_time":"2020-02-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Park, Sang Woo; Bolker, Benjamin M.; Champredon, David; Earn, David J.D.; Li, Michael; Weitz, Joshua S.; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Dushoff, Jonathan","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0ff4ad5359ee2df3568605385a8616d8da66bf2c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019877","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI4LmNzdjs5OTM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1750624,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"xnCNJxvJcD\u002B33QIX874CMw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_28.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["early estimates of Ro","early Ro estimates","components of Ro","different estimates of Ro","basic reproductive number Ro","mean generation interval","generation-interval distribution","generation-interval dispersion","SARS-CoV","novel statistical framework","average number of secondary cases","epidemic progresses","novel coronavirus","key quantities","exponential growth rate","wide range of models","primary case","bar G","efforts","shape","importance of propagating uncertainties","disease modelers","susceptible population","results","kappa","outset","modeling approaches","similar data sources","outbreak","global threat"],"language":"en"},

We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies.

The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming. We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios. The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.","publish_time":"2020-02-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhu, Xiaolin; Zhang, Aiyin; Xu, Shuai; Jia, Pengfei; Tan, Xiaoyue; Tian, Jiaqi; Wei, Tao; Quan, Zhenxian; Yu, Jiali","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2913d91f13fd59c698f68ba63008d8e0550c0607.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.09.20021360","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszOQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["city-level model","city level","trained model","prefecture-level cities","city-level epidemical dynamics","mainland China","individual cities","current dynamics","new confirmed cases","current trend","explicit epidemic model","different scenarios","control efforts","Wuhan travel history","rate of virus transmission","future dynamics","person","nCoV","total infections","days","possible scenarios","disease","peak point of daily new infections","serious epidemic","decay rate","pressure of work","unique characteristics","local residents","prediction","number of individuals","self-isolation policy","novel coronavirus","mobile phone data","government","resources","study","spatial pattern","aim","IAs","date"],"language":"en"},

Viral genes, despite the fact that they require Pol II for transcription, escape this transcriptional repression. Protection is not governed by viral promoter sequences; instead, location on the viral genome is both necessary and sufficient to escape the transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay. We hypothesize that the ability to escape from transcriptional repression is linked to the conformation of viral DNA in replication compartments, providing a means for these viruses to counteract decay-induced viral transcript loss.","publish_time":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hartenian, Ella N; Glaunsinger, Britt A","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ab8ede53675e581fa858c7d5a7d1cebf21f43462.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/585984","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs1Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pol II"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["transcriptional repression effects of mRNA decay","MHV68-induced mRNA decay","viral genome","mRNA endonuclease","widespread RNA decay","Viral genes","conformation of viral DNA","viral promoter sequences","viral transcript loss","widespread acceleration of cytoplasmic mRNA degradation","genome-wide reduction of Pol","mammalian cells","mammalian promoters","impaired RNA polymerase","gammaherpesviruses","Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus","KSHV","replication compartments","occupancy","infection","location","murine gammaherpesvirus","means","fact","Protection","ability","exonuclease Xrn1"],"language":"en"},

Chest X- ray is an important diagnostic test to assess the lung for the damaging effects of COVID-19. Many other microbial pathogens can also cause damage to lungs leading to pneumonia but there are certain radiological features which can favor the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by COVID-19. With the rising number of cases of COVID-19, it would be imperative to develop computer programs which may assist the health professionals in the prevailing scenario. Materials \u0026 Methods : A total of two hundred and seventy eight (278) images of chest X-rays have been assessed by applying ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architectures in the present study. The digital images were acquired from the public repositories provided by University of Montreal and National Institutes of Health. These digital images of Chest X-rays were divided into three groups labeled as normal, pneumonia and COVID- 19. The third group contains digital images of chest X-rays of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection while the second group contains images of lung with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. Results : The radiological images included in the data set are 89 images of lungs with COVID-19 infection, 93 images of lungs without any radiological abnormality and 96 images of patient with pneumonia caused by other pathogens. In this data set, 80% of the images were employed for training, and 20% for testing. A pre-trained (on ImageNet data set) ResNet-50 architecture was used to diagnose the cases of COVID-19 infections on lung Xray images. The analysis of the data revealed that computer vision based program achieved diagnostic accuracy of 98.18 %, and F1-score of 98.19. Conclusion : The performance of convolutional neural network regarding the differentiation of pulmonary changes caused by COVID-19 from the other type of pneumonias on digital images of the chest X- rays is excellent and it may be an extremely useful adjunct tool for the health professionals.

However, no comprehensive evaluation of these molecules in the context of the achievable plasma pharmacokinetics after administration of approved doses and schedules to humans has been conducted. Moreover, most publications have focussed on 50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available publications up to 13th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of these drugs demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax/EC50 as a better indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50 by 3.1- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date is of variable quality and conducted under different conditions by different investigators. However, this analysis has prioritised candidates with the best chance for success in therapy or chemoprevention of Covid-19 based upon the currently available in vitro activity and human plasma pharmacokinetic data.

The disparate ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract have been demonstrated to influence the replication kinetics of common cold viruses as well as the associated host responses. Here, we employed the human airway epithelial cell (hAEC) culture model to investigate the impact of ambient temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract, 33\u00B0C and 37\u00B0C, respectively, on the viral replication kinetics and host innate immune response dynamics during SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2, in contrast to SARS-CoV, replicated more efficiently at temperatures encountered in the upper respiratory tract, and displayed higher sensitivity to type I and type III IFNs than SARS-CoV. Time-resolved transcriptome analysis highlighted a temperature-dependent induction of IFN-mediated antiviral response, whose amplitude inversely correlated with the replication kinetic efficiencies of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV at temperatures found in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Altogether, these data reflect clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and subsequently, their associated human-to-human transmission efficiencies. They provide crucial insights of the profound impact of ambient temperatures on viral replication and associated pivotal virus - host interaction dynamics.

SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been rapidly developed and quickly applied to clinical testing during the pandemic. However, studies evaluating the performance of these NAAT assays are limited. We evaluated the performance of four NAATs, which were marked by the Conformit\u00E9 Europ\u00E9enne and widely used in China during the pandemic. Results showed that the analytical sensitivity of the four assays was significantly lower than that claimed by the NAAT manufacturers. The limit of detection (LOD) of Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs was 3000 copies/mL, whereas the LOD of Bioperfectus NAATs was 4000 copies/mL. The results of the consistency test using 46 samples showed that Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs could detect the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity of 100% (16 /16), whereas Bioperfectus NAAT detected the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity 81.25% (13/16). The sensitivity of Bioperfectus NAAT was lower than that of the three other NAATs; this finding was consistent with the result that Bioperfectus NAAT had a higher LOD than the three other kinds of NAATs. The four above mentioned reagents presented high specificity; however, for the detection of the samples with low virus concentration, Bioperfectus reagent had the risk of missing detection. Therefore, the LOD should be considered in the selection of SARS-CoV-2 NAATs.","publish_time":"2020-03-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Xiong, Yujuan; Li, Zhen-Zhen; Zhuang, Qi-Zhen; Chao, Yan; Li, Fei; Ge, Yi-Yuan; Wang, Yi; Ke, Pei-Feng; Huang, Xian-Zhang","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2b3410564f2be7051199e6996bb69efc65cced47.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.010975","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs3MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Hybribio"],"organizations":["NAAT","Bioperfectus NAAT","LOD"],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["LOD of Bioperfectus NAATs","Hybribio NAATs","sensitivity of Bioperfectus NAAT","kinds of NAATs","samples","NAAT assays","Bioperfectus reagent","SARS-CoV","NAAT manufacturers","higher LOD","limit of detection","analytical sensitivity","Daan","risk of missing detection","Sansure","selection of SARS","copies","high specificity","Results","performance","pandemic","detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Coronavirus disease","low virus concentration","real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","nucleic acid amplification tests","consistency test","China","mentioned reagents","finding","Conformit\u00E9 Europ\u00E9enne","clinical testing","COVID","studies"],"language":"en"},

Trends in such reports over time are likely to reflect behaviour of the ongoing epidemic within the wider community, potentially capturing valuable information across a broader severity profile of cases than hospital admission data. We present a fully reproducible analysis of temporal trends in NHS Pathways reports until 14th May 2020, nationally and regionally, and demonstrate that rates of growth/decline and effective reproduction number estimated from these data may be useful in monitoring transmission.

There were significant relationships between predictor variables hours of sleep per night and physical activity time on reported weight gain (r=-.195, p = .021, r=-.155, p = .034, respectively). Conclusion Risk factors for weight gain during self-quarantine are inadequate sleep, snacking after dinner, lack of dietary restraint, eating in response to stress, and reduced physical activity.","publish_time":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zachary, Zeigler; Brianna, Forbes; Brianna, Lopez; Garrett, Pedersen; Jade, Welty; Alyssa, Deyo; Mikayla, Kerekes","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/cfe12cbe0fd1928d22c300afad2812c88830672f.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871403X20303781; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871403X20303781?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxMzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["reported weight gain","response","eating","physical activity time","self-quarantine","total sample","dinner","stress","surveys","behaviors","pounds","Conclusion Risk factors","inadequate sleep","Research announcement","possible participants","correlational research design","predictor variables hours of sleep","night","significant relationships","single Survey Monkey questionnaire","lack of dietary restraint","study","Facebook","impact","sight","smell","higher percentage","Abstract Objective","purpose","questions","Methods","home","COVID","Results"],"language":"en"},

Only way to respond against this critical condition is by practicing large-scale social distancing. India lock down for 21 days, however, till 7 April 2020, SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were growing exponentially, which raises the concerns if the number of reported and actual cases are similar. Methods: We use Lasso Regression with \u03B1=0.12 and Polynomial features of degree 2 to predict the growth factor. Also, we predicted Logistic curve using the Prophet Python. Further, using the growth rate to logistic, and carrying capacity is 20000 allowed us to calculate the maximum cases and new cases per day. Results: We found the predicted growth factor with a standard deviation of 0.3443 for the upcoming days. When the growth factor becomes 1.0, which is known as Inflection point, it will be safe to state that the rate is no longer exponential. The estimated time to reach the inflection point is between 15-20 April. At that time, the estimated number of total positive cases will be over 12500, if lockdown remains continue. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that there is an urgent need to take action to extend the period of lockdown and allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. Otherwise, the outbreak in India can reach the level of the USA or Italy or could be worse than these countries within a few days or weeks, given the size of the population and lack of resources.","publish_time":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh Virk, Jitender; Ali, Syed Azmal; Kaur, Gurjeet","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/90b87bfdea94ee0a26e8b7b9fdf0ac7ba773ba94.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.20053124","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsxNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Prophet Python"],"locations":["India"],"keyphrases":["maximum cases","new cases","actual cases","growth rate","predicted growth factor","upcoming days","estimated number of total positive cases","SARS-CoV","estimated time","Indian population","largest population","Inflection point","weeks","Logistic curve","lack of resources","period of lockdown","standard deviation","beds","critical condition","intensive care facilities","action","scenario","personnel","level","global pandemic","size","large-scale social distancing","Polynomial features of degree","Lasso Regression","devastating impact","USA","Italy","Prophet Python","situation","countries","urgent need","analysis","Methods","way","state","Abstract Background","world","outbreak","capacity","Results","Conclusions","concerns"],"language":"en"},

There are many publicly available databases and tools that offer appealing features to help with such a task. However, many applications lack exposure or are constrained with unfriendly or outdated user interfaces. Thus, it follows that there are many resources that are relevant to investigation of medical disorders that are underutilized. Results We developed an R Shiny web application, called Kaleidoscope, to address this challenge. The application offers access to several omics databases and tools to let users explore research questions in silico. The application is designed to be user- friendly with a unified user interface, while also scalable by offering the option of uploading user-defined datasets. We demonstrate the application features with a starting query of a single gene (Disrupted in schizophrenia 1, DISC1) to assess its protein-protein interactions network. We then explore expression levels of the gene network across tissues and cell types in the brain, as well as across 34 schizophrenia versus control differential gene expression datasets. Conclusion Kaleidoscope provides easy access to several databases and tools under a unified user interface to explore research questions in silico. The web application is open-source and freely available at https://kalganem.shinyapps.io/Kaleidoscope/.

However, with the increasing demand for protection, face masks are becoming limited in stock, and the concerned individuals and healthcare workers from many countries are now facing the issue of the reuse of potentially contaminated masks. Although various technologies already exist for the sterilization of medical equipment, most of them are not applicable for eliminating virus from face masks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a fast and easy method of disinfecting contaminated face masks. In this study, using a human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination on face masks, we show that the virus loses its infectivity to a human cell line (MRC-5) when exposed for a short period of time (1 min) to ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma generator. Scanning electron microscopy and particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) tests revealed that there was no structural or functional deterioration observed in the face masks even after they underwent excessive exposure to ozone (five 1-minute exposures). Interestingly, for face masks exposed to ozone gas for 5 min, the amplification of HCoV-229E RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction suggested a loss of infectivity under the effect of ozone, primarily owing to the damage caused to viral envelopes or envelope proteins. Ozone gas is a strong oxidizing agent with the ability to kill viruses on hard-to-reach surfaces, including the fabric structure of face masks. These results suggest that it may be possible to rapidly disinfect contaminated face masks using a plasma generator in a well-ventilated place.","publish_time":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lee, J.; Bong, C.; Bae, P.

We reported here the first clinical study using hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, danoprevir, to treat COVID-19 patients. Danoprevir (Ganovo) is a potent HCV protease (NS3/4A) inhibitor (IC50 = 0.29 nM), which was approved and marketed in China since 2018 to treat chronic hepatitis C patients. Ritonavir is a CYP3A4 inhibitor to enhance plasma concentration of danoprevir while it also acts as a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor at high doses. The chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 shares structure similarity with HCV and HIV proteases. In the current clinical study (NCT04291729) conducted at the Nineth Hospital of Nanchang, we evaluated therapeutic effects of danoprevir, boosted by ritonavir, on treatment naive and experienced COVID-19 patients. The data from this small-sample clinical study showed that danoprevir boosted by ritonavir is safe and well tolerated in all patients. After 4 to 12-day treatment of danoprevir boosted by ritonavir, all eleven patients enrolled, two naive and nine experienced, were discharged from the hospital as they met all four conditions as follows: (1) normal body temperature for at least 3 days; (2) significantly improved respiratory symptoms; (3) lung imaging shows obvious absorption and recovery of acute exudative lesion; and (4) two consecutive RT-PCR negative tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide acid (respiratory track sampling with interval at least one day).

In the simplest case, the population is given a smaller fraction of 10-20% with higher susceptibility and the balance of 80-90% with lower susceptibility. Susceptibility is taken to include the level of immunity to the virus combined with the societal circumstances of certain smaller groups within a population. This is programmed numerically by considering a realistic random rate of contacts, together with an assumed constant viral genome. The remaining major variable is the societal response of nations to the outbreak, with earlier or later application of various degrees of lockdown, tracing and sanitation. China, South Korea and other nations, including Germany, have stopped or greatly slowed the spread of the disease before it could run its course through a whole population. Using this model the extent of progress toward herd immunity is discussed, with an in-principle estimate of the remaining toll to be experienced.","publish_time":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGeoch, M.

The general objective of this research work is to obtain a global vision of the daily growth of scientific production on COVID-19 in different databases (Dimensions, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus-Elsevier, Pubmed and eight repositories). In relation to the results obtained, Dimensions indexes a total of 9435 publications (69% with peer review and 2677 preprints) well above Scopus (1568) and WoS (718). This is a classic biliometric phenomenon of exponential growth (R2 = 0.92). The global growth rate is 500 publications and the production doubles every 15 days. In the case of Pubmed the weekly growth is around 1000 publications. Of the eight repositories analysed, Pubmed Central, Medrxiv and SSRN are the leaders. Despite their enormous contribution, the journals continue to be the core of scientific communication. Finally, it has been established that three out of every four publications on the COVID-19 are available in open access.

This situation highlights the need for rapid, sensitive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays capable of high-throughput operation that can preferably utilize existing equipment to facilitate broad, large-scale screening efforts. We have developed a CRISPR-based assay that can meet all these criteria. This assay utilizes a custom CRISPR Cas12a/gRNA complex and a fluorescent probe to amplify target amplicons produced by standard RT-PCR or isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), to allow sensitive detection at sites not equipped with real-time PCR systems required for qPCR diagnostics. We found this approach allowed sensitive and robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, with a sample-to-answer time of \u223C50 min, and a limit of detection of 2 copies per sample. CRISPR assay diagnostic results obtained nasal swab samples of individuals with suspected COVID-19 cases were comparable to paired results from a CDC-approved qPCR assay performed in a state testing lab, and superior to those produced by same assay in a clinical lab, where the qPCR assay exhibited multiple invalid or inconclusive results. Our assay also demonstrated greater analytical sensitivity and more robust diagnostic performance than other recently reported CRISPR-based assays. Based on these findings, we believe that a CRISPR-based fluorescent application has potential to improve current COVID-19 screening efforts.","publish_time":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huang, Zhen; Tian, Di; Liu, Yang; Lin, Zhen; Lyon, Christopher; Lai, Weihua; Fusco, Dahlene; Drouin, Arnaud; Yin, Xiaoming; Hu, Tony; Ning, Bo","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c8e9fe46a5fe98d7cd224f08cfe79dc5ec518380.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566320303110; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566320303110?v=s5","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyNTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CRISPR assay diagnostic results","sensitive SARS-CoV","CDC-approved qPCR assay","sensitive detection","reported CRISPR-based assays","robust detection of SARS","infected individuals","custom CRISPR Cas12a","robust diagnostic performance","paired results","inconclusive results","qPCR diagnostics","limit of detection","nasal swab samples of individuals","diagnostic assays capable of high","large-scale screening efforts","suspected COVID","current COVID","positive samples","fluorescent probe","fluorescent application","clinical lab","infected person","standard RT-PCR","real-time PCR systems","state testing lab","isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification","throughput operation","RPA","gRNA complex","cases","target amplicons","greater analytical sensitivity","existing equipment","sites","potential","need","Recent research","copies","approach","situation","answer time","average","findings","criteria"],"language":"en"},

We suggest that a two-step sequential pooling procedure could identify positive subjects, ensuring at the same time significant benefits of costs and time.

Recent findings of substantial liver damage in patients and ACE2\u002B cholangiocytes in healthy liver tissues prompted us to hypothesize that human liver ductal organoids could serve as a model to determine the susceptibility and mechanisms underlining the liver damage upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that long-term liver ductal organoid culture preserved the human specific ACE2\u002B population of cholangiocytes. Moreover, human liver ductal organoids were permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and support robust replication. Notably, virus infection impaired the barrier and bile acid transporting functions of cholangiocytes through dysregulation of genes involved in tight junction formation and bile acid transportation, which could explain the bile acid accumulation and consequent liver damage in patients. These results indicate that control of liver damage caused directly by viral infection should be valued in treating COVID-19 patients.

While the global source sink dynamics of the different seasonal influenza viruses have been studied intensively, it\u2019s local spread remains less clear. In order to improve our understanding of how influenza is transmitted on a city scale, we collected an extremely densely sampled set of influenza sequences alongside patient metadata. To do so, we sequenced influenza viruses isolated from patients of two different hospitals, as well as private practitioners in Basel, Switzerland during the 2016/2017 influenza season. The genetic sequences reveal that repeated introductions into the city drove the influenza season. We then reconstruct how the effective reproduction number changed over the course of the season. We find trends in transmission dynamics correlated positively with trends in temperature, but not relative humidity nor school holidays. Alongside the genetic sequence data that allows us to see how individual cases are connected, we gathered patient information, such as the age or household status. Zooming into the local transmission outbreaks suggests that the elderly were to a large extent infected within their own transmission network, while school children likely drove the spread within the remaining transmission network. These patterns will be valuable to plan interventions combating the spread of respiratory diseases within cities given that similar patterns are observed for other influenza seasons and cities. Author summary As shown with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, respiratory diseases can quickly spread around the globe. While it can be hugely important to understand how diseases spread around the globe, local spread is most often the main driver of novel infections of respiratory diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 or influenza. We here use genetic sequence data alongside patient information to better understand what the drives the local spread of influenza by looking at the 2016/2017 influenza season in Basel, Switzerland as an example. The genetic sequence data allows us to reconstruct the how the transmission dynamics changed over the course of the season, which we correlate to changes, but not humidity or school holidays. Additionally, the genetic sequence data allows us to see how individual cases are connected. Using patient information, such as age and household status our analyses suggest that the elderly mainly transmit within their own transmission network. Additionally, they suggest that school aged children, but not pre-school aged children are important drivers of the local spread of influenza.","publish_time":"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"M\u00FCller, Nicola F.; W\u00FCthrich, Daniel; Goldman, Nina; Sailer, Nadine; Saalfrank, Claudia; Brunner, Myrta; Augustin, No\u00E9mi; Seth-Smith, Helena MB; Hollenstein, Yvonne; Syedbasha, Mohammedyaseen; Lang, Daniela; Neher, Richard A.; Dubuis, Olivier; Naegele, Michael; Buser, Andreas; Nickel, Christian H.; Ritz, Nicole; Zeller, Andreas; Lang, Brian M.; Hadfield, James; Bedford, Trevor; Battegay, Manuel; Schneider-Sliwa, Rita; Egli, Adrian; Stadler, Tanja","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0f24d0303ff578e21348ed633876175ad11c82a3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.052225","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjsyOTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Basel","Switzerland"],"keyphrases":["local spread of influenza","influenza seasons","spread of respiratory diseases","different seasonal influenza viruses","transmission dynamics","genetic sequence data","sampled set of influenza sequences","local transmission outbreaks","school children","patient information","genetic sequences","remaining transmission network","school holidays","globe","patient metadata","pre-school aged children","Switzerland","elderly","Basel","course","cities","household status","trends","individual cases","main driver of novel infections of respiratory diseases","global source sink dynamics","current SARS-CoV","different hospitals","global population","important drivers","similar patterns","relative humidity","large portions","large extent","city scale","major burden","pandemic","interventions","private practitioners","repeated introductions","temperature","analyses","societies","patients","drives","effective reproduction number","Author summary","example","understanding","order"],"language":"en"},

Immunotherapy and plasma therapy has been used with satisfactory efficacy over the past two decades in many viral infections like SARS (Systemic Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and H1N1. Limited data from China show clinical benefit, radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads, and improved survival. Our aim is to create a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission and then apply various control parameters to see their effects on recovery from COVID-19 disease. We have formulated a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations, calculated basic reproduction R0, and applied five different controls (self-isolation, quarantine, herd immunity, immunotherapy, plasma therapy) to test the effectiveness of control strategy. Control optimality was checked by Lagrangian functions. Numerical simulations and bifurcation analyses were carried out. The study concludes that the COVID-19 outbreak can be controlled up to a significant level three weeks after applying all the control strategies together. These strategies lead to a reduction in hospitalization and a rise in recovery from infection. Immunotherapy is highly effective initially in hospitalized infected individuals however better results were seen in the long term with plasma therapy.","publish_time":"2020-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shah, N.

Standard methods for assessing autochthonous (local) transmission risk make either indirect estimates based on ecological suitability or direct estimates only after local cases accumulate. However, an overlooked source of epidemiological data that can meaningfully inform risk assessments prior to outbreak emergence is the absence of transmission by imported cases. Here, we present a method for updating a priori ecological estimates of transmission risk using real-time importation data. We demonstrate our method using Zika importation and transmission data from Texas in 2016, a high-risk region in the southern United States. Our updated risk estimates are lower than previously reported, with only six counties in Texas likely to sustain a Zika epidemic, and consistent with the number of autochthonous cases detected in 2017.

ACE2 is a receptor protein of SARS- CoV-2, and TMPRSS2 promotes virus proliferation and transmission. Some patients developed multiple organ dysfunction syndromes other than lungs. Therefore, studying the viral susceptibility of other organs is important for a deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis. Methods The advantage of scRNA-seq data is the identification of cell types by clustering the gene expression of cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in AT2 of lungs, we compared the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels of cell types from 31 organs, with AT2 of lungs to evaluate the risk of the viral infection using scRNA-seq data. Findings For the first time, we found the brain, gall bladder, and fallopian tube are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Besides, the nose, heart, small intestine, large intestine, esophagus, testis and kidney are also identified to be high-risk organs with high expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Moreover, the susceptible organs are grouped into three risk levels based on the TMPRSS2 expression. As a result, the respiratory system, digestive system and reproductive system are at the top-risk level to COVID-19 infection.

In such cases, conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak to more effectively mitigate the spread of the disease. Using a simple epidemiological model we show that, however, there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire further investigations within the context of more complex and data-driven epidemiological models, and can ultimately help decision makers to improve temporal social distancing policies to mitigate the spread of epidemics.","publish_time":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Patterson-Lomba, Oscar","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c3dcba758cf86b373c6c440cc015c4b843b27f55.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048132","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszMzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["social distancing measures","temporal social distancing policies","temporal social distancing intervention","optimal time","pharmacological interventions","epidemic curve","optimal timing","spread of epidemics","contagious disease","simple epidemiological model","simple model","final epidemic size","effective way","R0 increases","epidemiological models","effective reproduction number","goal","conventional wisdom","decision makers","context","data","vaccine","novel pathogen","investigations","insights","cases","point","outbreak","fact","beginning","effectiveness"],"language":"en"},

We also found that a basic set of user features and event time summary statistics performs competitively in both classification and regression tasks, and that adding point process information to the feature set further improves predictions.

Methods Population studies with sample size of at least 500 and published as peer-reviewed papers or preprints as of May 12, 2020 were retrieved from PubMed, preprint servers, and communications with experts. Studies on blood donors were included, but studies on healthcare workers were excluded. The studies were assessed for design features and seroprevalence estimates. Infection fatality rate was estimated from each study dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths at a relevant time point by the number of estimated people infected in each relevant region. Correction was also attempted accounting for the types of antibodies assessed. Results Twelve studies were identified with usable data to enter into calculations. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.113% to 25.9% and adjusted seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.309% to 33%. Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.03% to 0.50% and corrected values ranged from 0.02% to 0.40%. Conclusions The infection fatality rate of COVID-19 can vary substantially across different locations and this may reflect differences in population age structure and case-mix of infected and deceased patients as well as multiple other factors. Estimates of infection fatality rates inferred from seroprevalence studies tend to be much lower than original speculations made in the early days of the pandemic.","publish_time":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ioannidis, J.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63ac855edf0d6628c7d57135c701107154ec2e40.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.13.20101253v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjszNzk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["data of seroprevalence studies","infection fatality rate of COVID","Estimates of infection fatality rates","Methods Population studies","adjusted seroprevalence estimates","infection fatality rate of coronavirus disease","number of COVID","number of estimated people","relevant region","usable data","relevant time point","population age structure","differences","case","deaths","preprint servers","communications","early days","original speculations","deceased patients","sample size","study","design features","Conclusions","accounting","peer-reviewed papers","preprints","PubMed","experts","blood donors","Objective","types of antibodies","factors","pandemic","different locations","calculations","healthcare workers","Results","corrected values","Correction"],"language":"en"},

Methods: Taking Hubei province of China as an example, where COVID-19 was first reported and there were the most cases, we collected 53 days of confirmed cases (total 67773 cases) and ten meteorological parameters up to March 10. Correlation analysis and linear regression were used to judge the relationship of meteorological factors and increment of COVID-19 confirmed cases. Results: Under 95% CI, the increment of confirmed cases in Hubei were correlated with four meteorological parameters of average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure (equivalent to absolute humidity).The average pressure was positively correlated with the increment (r=\u002B0.358).The negative correlations included average temperature (r=-0.306), minimum temperature (r=-0.347), and average water vapor pressure (r=-0.326). The linear regression results show if minimum temperature increases by 1\u2103, the incremental confirmed cases in Hubei decreases by 72.470 units on average. Conclusion: Statistically, the incidence of COVID-19 was correlated with average pressure, average temperature, minimum temperature and average water vapor pressure. It is positively correlated with the average pressure and negatively correlated with the other three parameters. Compared with relative humidity, 2019-nCov is more sensitive to water vapor pressure. The reason why the epidemic situation in Hubei expanded rapidly is significantly related to the climate characteristics of low temperature and dryness of Hubei in winter.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Jianfeng; Zhang, Linyuan; Ren, Zhihua; Xing, Caihong; Qiao, Peihuan; Chang, Bing","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/30a471ddef6335b88d487168148d283c0676806c.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050526","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0MTI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China"],"keyphrases":["average temperature","average water vapor pressure","meteorological parameters of average pressure","minimum temperature","increment of confirmed cases","days of confirmed cases","incremental confirmed cases","incidence of COVID","dryness of Hubei","outbreak of COVID","climate characteristics of low temperature","relationship of meteorological factors","Hubei province of China","effects of various meteorological factors","potential factors","linear regression results","absolute humidity","relative humidity","equivalent","nCov","example","negative correlations","Correlation analysis","reason","epidemic situation","Methods","winter","units","Objective","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

A better understanding of the pathophysiology associated with COVID-19 is crucial to improve treatment modalities and to develop effective prevention strategies. Transcriptomic and proteomic data on the host response against SARS-CoV-2 still have anecdotic character; currently available data from other coronavirus infections are therefore a key source of information. Methods We investigated selected molecular aspects of three human coronavirus (HCoV) infections, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, through a network based-approach. A functional analysis of HCoV-host interactome was carried out in order to provide a theoretic host-pathogen interaction model for HCoV infections and in order to translate the results in prediction for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. The 3D model of S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the structure of the corresponding SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression, triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells. Results Although the amino acid sequences of the S-glycoprotein were found to be different between the various HCoV, the structures showed high similarity, but the best 3D structural overlap shared by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the shared ACE2 predicted receptor. The host interactome, linked to the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mainly highlighted innate immunity pathway components, such as Toll Like receptors, cytokines and chemokines. Conclusions In this paper, we developed a network-based model with the aim to define molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes in HCoV infections. The resulting pattern may facilitate the process of structure-guided pharmaceutical and diagnostic research with the prospect to identify potential new biological targets.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Messina, Francesco; Giombini, Emanuela; Agrati, Chiara; Vairo, Francesco; Bartoli, Tommaso Ascoli; Moghazi, Samir Al; Piacentini, Mauro; Locatelli, Franco; Kobinger, Gary; Maeurer, Markus; Zumla, Alimuddin; Capobianchi, Maria R.; Lauria, Francesco Nicola; Ippolito, Giuseppe","journal":"bioRxiv","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.082487","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0MjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["corresponding SARS-CoV","glycoprotein of SARS","MERS-CoV S-glycoprotein","HCoV infections","HCoV S-glycoprotein","various HCoV","host interactome","pathogenetic characteristics of SARS","functional analysis of HCoV","host response","host cells","D model of S","coronavirus infections","theoretic host-pathogen interaction model","network-based model","order","results","selected molecular aspects","molecular aspects of pathogenic phenotypes","human coronavirus","published protein-protein interactions","available data","proteomic data","process of structure","shared ACE2","D structural overlap","prospect","Toll","PPI","aim","innate immunity pathway components","high similarity","treatment modalities","amino acid sequences","diagnostic research","potential new biological targets","gene co-expression","receptors","Background Epidemiological","structures","anecdotic character","effective prevention strategies","prediction","key source of information","pathophysiology","COVID","cytokines","chemokines","Methods","better understanding","resulting pattern","paper","evaluation","pathogenesis","Conclusions","approach"],"language":"en"},

Systematic appraisal of national expert consensus can be used to generate interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available. Hence, we aimed to collect and quantitatively appraise nationwide UK senior surgeons opinion on clinical decision making for patients requiring cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We mailed a web-based questionnaire to all consultant cardiac surgeons through the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland (SCTS) mailing list on the 17th April 2020 and we pre-determined to close the survey on the 21st April 2020. This survey was primarily designed to gather information on UK surgeons opinion using 12 items. Strong consensus was predefined as an opinion shared by at least 60% of responding consultants. Results: A total of 86 consultant surgeons undertook the survey. All UK cardiac units were represented by at least one consultant. Strong consensus was achieved for the following key questions:1) before hospital admission every patient should receive nasopharyngeal swab, PCR and chest CT; 2) the use of full PPE should to be adopted in every case by the theatre team regardless patients COVID-19 status; 3) the risk of COVID-19 exposure for patients undergoing heart surgery should be considered moderate to high and likely to increase mortality if it occurs; 4) cardiac procedure should be decided based on ad-hoc multidisciplinary team discussion for every patient. The majority believed that both aortic and mitral surgery should be considered in selected cases. The role of CABG surgery during the pandemic was more controversial. Conclusions: In the current unprecedented scenario, the present survey provides information for generating interim recommendations until data from clinical observations will become available.","publish_time":"2020-04-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Benedetto, U.; Goodwin, A.; Kendall, S.; Uppal, R.; Akowuah, E.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b5f862b139c6592e2c75fbae0f206798836e3a09.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.24.20078105v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0Mjk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["UK","PPE"],"locations":["Great Britain","Ireland"],"keyphrases":["cardiac surgery","consultant cardiac surgeons","Cardiothoracic Surgery","mitral surgery","heart surgery","consultant surgeons","UK surgeons opinion","UK cardiac units","cardiac procedure","pandemic","role of CABG surgery","clinical decision","clinical observations","interim recommendations","risk of COVID","present survey","Strong consensus","theatre team regardless patients COVID","nationwide UK senior surgeons opinion","data","information","firm recommendations","Systematic appraisal of national expert consensus","multidisciplinary team discussion","web-based questionnaire","Ireland","Society","nasopharyngeal swab","Great Britain","current unprecedented scenario","chest CT","SCTS","hospital admission","PCR","status","exposure","following key questions","mailing list","use","Conclusions","total","items","selected cases","mortality","majority","Results","Background","PPE","Methods","consultants"],"language":"en"},

The number of cases follows in its early stages an almost exponential expansion; we chose as a starting point in each country the first day with 30 cases and we used 12 days, capturing thus the early exponential growth. We looked then for linear correlations of the exponents with other variables, for a sample of 126 countries. We find a positive correlation, faster spread of COVID-19 , with high confidence level with the following variables, with respective p-value: low Temperature (4x10 -7), high ratio of old vs. working-age people (3x10 -6), life expectancy (8x10 -6), number of international tourists (1x10 -5), earlier epidemic starting date (2x10 -5), high level of physical contact in greeting habits (6x10 -5), lung cancer prevalence (6x10 -5), obesity in males (1x10 -4), share of population in urban areas (2x10 -4), cancer prevalence (3x10 -4), alcohol consumption (0.0019), daily smoking prevalence (0.0036), UV index (0.004, smaller sample, 73 countries), low Vitamin D serum levels (0.002-0.006, smaller sample, 50 countries).

We also find positive correlation with moderate confidence level (p-value of 0.02-0.03) with: CO2/SO emissions, type-1 diabetes in children, low vaccination coverage for Tuberculosis (BCG). Several of the above variables are correlated with each other and so they are likely to have common interpretations. Other variables are found to have a counterintuitive negative correlation, which may be explained due their strong negative correlation with life expectancy: slower spread of COVID-19 is correlated with high death-rate due to pollution, prevalence of anemia and hepatitis B, high blood pressure in females. We also analyzed the possible existence of a bias: countries with low GDP-per capita, typically located in warm regions, might have less intense testing and we discuss correlation with the above variables.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Notari, A.; Torrieri, G.","journal":null,"pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1cfd77f38b7693fad2e244c790f819d620390ddd.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20095083v1?rss=1","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI5LmNzdjs0NjA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1999608,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:36:07Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"sSxOe/LsVJrDi0AErcGbLA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_29.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["positive correlation","2x10","significant correlation","strong negative correlation","counterintuitive negative correlation","high confidence level","different countries","following variables","high blood pressure","high death-rate","high level of physical contact","low Temperature","low GDP-","prevalence of anemia","smaller sample","high ratio of old","lung cancer prevalence","recent COVID","blood type","low vaccination coverage","slower spread of COVID","moderate confidence level","6x10","faster spread of COVID","life expectancy","3x10","daily smoking prevalence","early exponential growth","1x10","number of cases","respective p-value","low Vitamin D serum levels","hepatitis B","initial transmission growth rate","early stages","exponential expansion","starting point","epidemic starting date","number of international tourists","diabetes","children","pollution","greeting habits","types RH","working-age people","Tuberculosis","bias","4x10","UV index","country","BCG","pandemic","females","risk factors","alcohol consumption","intense testing","emissions","obesity","exponents","urban areas","population","possible existence","days","8x10","warm regions","linear correlations","common interpretations","CO2"],"language":"en"},

Agriculture continues to be most important economic activity in Pakistan and former FATA is no exception. However, agriculture in the semi-arid Khyber District continues to suffer a decline due to excessive reliance on rainfall, which is drastically insufficient. Khyber District have large expanses of fertile land; however, farmers depend on unpredictable rain-fed agriculture, which has low productivity and food insecurity. There are a number of rivers in the region where great prospects exist for irrigated farming. Geographical information systems (GIS)-based multi-criteria analysis can be used to map areas with irrigation potential. The current study focused on different variables including soil texture, perennial rivers, land cover, topography, and dams. For this study, data was collected from diverse sources which include Google earth images, top sheets, land use land cover, soil texture map of FATA, and SRTM 30 Meter. The collected data was analyzed by using multi-criteria analysis in Arc GIS 10.2.2 by using MIF technique. The results of this research indicate that there is great potential for irrigated farming in the study area. Potential land for this purpose were divided into three categories, i.e., highly suitable which consisted of 678 km2, or 26% of the total area; 1044 km2 representing 40% were moderately suitable to irrigation; while the remaining 698 km2 representing 27% were considered least suitable for irrigation. Likewise, 204 km2 representing 7% were deemed unsuitable for irrigated agriculture mostly consisting of barren rocks. The results also illustrate how GIS as a tool can be used in the exploration of water resources in a scientific approach, thus making decision-making easier and more accurate.","publish_time":"2020-05-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Waleed, Muhammad; Ahmad, Sajid Rashid; Javed, Muhammad Asif; Samiullah, Saifullah","journal":"Environmental science and pollution research international","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08967-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388752/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs0ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Khyber District of Former Federally Administered Tribal Area","Google","SRTM","MIF","GIS"],"locations":["Khyber"],"keyphrases":["irrigated agriculture","Potential land","km2","study area","land use land cover","irrigated farming","irrigation potential","great potential","current study","soil texture map of FATA","large expanses of fertile land","Arc GIS","semi-arid Khyber District","multi-criteria analysis","Tribal Area","total area","collected data","results","perennial rivers","great prospects","number of rivers","sheets","different variables","Google earth images","scientific approach","diverse sources","Pakistan","decline","region","topography","opportunities","important economic activity","rainfall","exploration of water resources","low productivity","farmers","SRTM","Geographical information systems","food insecurity","excessive reliance","MIF technique","unpredictable rain","dams","research","purpose","barren rocks","areas","categories","tool","Meter","exception"],"language":"en"},

For initial-onset VKH disease, it is increasingly thought that corticosteroid therapy is not sufficient and additional non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapy is needed. At the 11th workshop on VKH, the disease was said to be well controlled with corticosteroids alone in Japanese patients. The aim of this study was to review the literature to determine whether different levels of severity exist in different geographical areas. METHODS Literature was reviewed for studies on the evolution of initial-onset VKH disease, looking at treatment modalities and proportion of cases with chronic evolution and/or sunset-glow fundus (SGF). RESULTS PubMed search yielded 1249 references containing the term of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada. Twenty references (15 from outside of Japan and 5 from Japan) contained information on the evolution of treated initial-onset disease. For the \u0022international\u0022 group, percentage of chronic evolution after systemic corticosteroid monotherapy was 61%, and after combined steroidal and non-steroidal therapy it fell to 2% (0% in 3/4 studies). In the Japanese studies where all patients received systemic corticosteroids alone, chronic evolution was reported in 25%; however, SGF amounted to 61%. CONCLUSION In the world at large, chronic evolution of initial-onset VKH disease treated with corticosteroids alone concerned two-thirds of patients. Japanese studies showed that chronic evolution was substantially less frequent, indicating possibly less severe disease in Japan. This proportion fell to almost zero when dual steroidal and non-steroidal immunosuppression was given at onset.","publish_time":"2020-05-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Herbort, Carl P; Tugal-Tutkun, Ilknur; Khairallah, Moncef; Abu El Asrar, Ahmed M; Pav\u00E9sio, Carlos E; Soheilian, Masoud","journal":"International ophthalmology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-020-01417-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418076/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SGF"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["chronic evolution of initial","initial-onset VKH disease","evolution of treated initial-onset disease","percentage of chronic evolution","severe disease","non-steroidal therapy","Japanese studies","non-steroidal immunosuppression","Japanese patients","additional non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapy","systemic corticosteroids","corticosteroid therapy","Koyanagi-Harada","references","thirds of patients","SGF","systemic corticosteroid monotherapy","Purpose Vogt-Koyanagi","term of Vogt","proportion of cases","METHODS Literature","different levels of severity","different geographical areas","treatment modalities","primary autoimmune stromal choroiditis","spill","sunset-glow fundus","group","world","information","RESULTS PubMed search","Background","panuveitis","study","CONCLUSION","workshop","aim"],"language":"en"},

This study compares the impacts of standard air purifying respirators and powered air purifying respirators during simulated difficult airway scenarios. Twenty-five anaesthetists carried out four different standardised difficult intubation drills, either unprotected (control), or wearing a standard, or a powered respirator. Treatment times and wearer comfort were determined and compared. In the wearer comfort evaluation form, operators rated mobility, noise, heat, vision, and speech intelligibility. All anaesthetists accomplished the treatment objectives of all study arms without adverse events. Total mean (SD) intubation times for the four interventions did not show significant differences between the powered and the standard respirator groups, being 16.4 (8.6) vs. 19.2 (5.2) seconds with the Airtraq\u2122, 11.4 (3.4) vs. 10.0 (2.1) seconds with the videolaryngoscope, 39.2 (4.5) vs. 40.1 (4.8) seconds with the fibreoptic bronchoscope scope, and 15.4 (5.7) vs. 15.1 (5.0) seconds for standard endotracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy, respectively. Videolaryngoscopy achieved the shortest intubation times regardless of the respiratory protective device used.

In this study, we determined the capacity of the rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS), also known as intelligent knife (iKnife), to discriminate between healthy, preinvasive, and invasive cervical tissue. Cervical tissue samples were collected from women with healthy, human papilloma virus (HPV) \u00B1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), or cervical cancer. A handheld diathermy device generated surgical aerosol, which was transferred into a mass spectrometer for subsequent chemical analysis. Combination of principal component and linear discriminant analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was employed to study the spectral differences between groups. Significance of discriminatory m/z features was tested using univariate statistics and tandem MS performed to elucidate the structure of the significant peaks allowing separation of the two classes. We analyzed 87 samples (normal = 16, HPV \u00B1 CIN = 50, cancer = 21 patients). The iKnife discriminated with 100% accuracy normal (100%) vs. HPV \u00B1 CIN (100%) vs. cancer (100%) when compared to histology as the gold standard. When comparing normal vs. cancer samples, the accuracy was 100% with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 83.9 to 100) and specificity 100% (79.4 to 100). Univariate analysis revealed significant MS peaks in the cancer-to-normal separation belonging to various classes of complex lipids.

This case emphasizes the risks of discharge location in the COVID-19 era as well as the importance of clinical suspicion, early isolation practices for those presumed positive, and repeat testing, given the marginal sensitivity of available COVID-19 RT-PCR.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Fisher, Bryant; Seese, Laura; Sultan, Ibrahim; Kilic, Arman","journal":"Journal of cardiac surgery","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32400044/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs1ODU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cluster of COVID","RT-PCR","marginal sensitivity of available COVID","urgent indications","following discharge","coronavirus disease","risks of discharge location","urgent coronary artery bypass","initial reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction","early isolation practices","year-old female","importance of clinical suspicion","resource utilization","patients","repeat testing","tests","nursing facility","surgery","transmission","elective cardiac surgeries","postoperative recovery","symptomatology","imaging","cases"],"language":"en"},

Computed tomography (CT) has been described as a diagnostic modality in the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan. We present a case series with virologically confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Variable CT features were observed: consolidation with ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with subpleural reticular bands, and an anterior-posterior gradient of lung abnormalities resembling that of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In one patient, we noted evolution of CT findings, where there was interval resolution of bilateral lung consolidation with development of bronchiolectasis and subpleural fibrotic bands. While sensitive for detecting lung parenchymal abnormalities in COVID-19 pneumonia, CT for initial diagnosis is discouraged and should be reserved for specific clinical indications. Interpretation of chest CT findings should be correlated with duration of symptoms to better determine the disease stage and aid in patient management.","publish_time":"2020-04-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lim, Zhan Ye; Khoo, Hau Wei; Hui, Terrence Chi Hong; Kok, Shawn Shi Xian; Kwan, Kenneth Eng Ling; Young, Barnaby Edward; Tan, Cher Heng; Kaw, Gregory Jon Leng","journal":"Singapore medical journal","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2020066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32312025/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzI2LmNzdjs2MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1244318,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:51Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"RWtfhXQF5D47irDNVihxgQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_26.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["evolution of CT findings","confirmed COVID","Variable CT features","Interpretation of chest CT findings","ground-glass opacities","lung parenchymal abnormalities","pneumonia","subpleural reticular bands","subpleural fibrotic bands","interval resolution of bilateral lung consolidation","anterior-posterior gradient of lung abnormalities","disease stage","specific assays","patient management","initial diagnosis","coronavirus disease","upper respiratory tract","specific clinical indications","acute respiratory distress syndrome","development of bronchiolectasis","viral nucleic acid","aid","case series","duration of symptoms","treatment plan","diagnostic modality","infections","lower airways","Computed tomography"],"language":"en"},

In an umbrella review, we aim to systematically summarize existing systematic reviews examining the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in people with a psychiatric disorder. When information is available in the identified systematic reviews, comparisons with control groups without a psychiatric disorder will be made. Furthermore, we aim to assess the quality of the included systematic reviews. METHODS The umbrella review will be based on a comprehensive systematic search of systematic reviews of observational (cross-sectional or longitudinal) studies investigating the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in people with a psychiatric disorder. Four electronic databases (Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) will be searched. Retrieved papers will be screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Furthermore, the reference lists of all included publications will be screened. Data will be extracted by using an a priori developed data extraction form and two independent reviewers will assess the risk of bias in the included systematic reviews using with the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool. A narrative data-synthesis and a subsequent meta-analysis based on the primary studies will be made. DISCUSSION For each psychiatric disorder, the data regarding the prevalence of type 2 diabetes will be summarized and discussed. When possible, comparisons with control groups will be reported and discussed. Finally, future implications and recommendations for clinical care will be presented.

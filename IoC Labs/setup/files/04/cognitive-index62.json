Eighty percent and 59% of impounded cats developed URI, 71% and 54% of cats developed diarrhea, and 91% and 83% of cats had at least one disease in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Uses of multiple drug administration (more than five drugs) was associated with prolonged URI and diarrhea. Multiple antibiotics, antihistamines, interferon, and steroids were associated with relapse of and prolonged URI.

However, investigation of the ADCC epitopes on the highly immunogenic influenza hemagglutinin (HA) head region has been rarely reported. In this study, we determined the ADCC and antiviral activities of two putative ADCC epitopes, designated E1 and E2, on the HA head of a pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in vitro and in a lethal mouse model. Our data demonstrated that sera from the E1-vaccinated mice could induce high ADCC activities. Importantly, the induction of ADCC response modestly decreased viral load in the lungs of H1N1-infected mice. However, the elevated ADCC significantly increased mouse alveolar damage and mortality than that of the PBS-vaccinated group (P \u003C 0.0001). The phenotype was potentially due to an exaggerated inflammatory cell infiltration triggered by ADCC, as an upregulated release of cytotoxic granules (perforin) was observed in the lung tissue of E1-vaccinated mice after H1N1 influenza virus challenge. Overall, our data suggested that ADCC elicited by certain domains of HA head region might have a detrimental rather than protective effect during influenza virus infection. Thus, future design of universal influenza vaccine shall strike a balance between the induction of protective immunity and potential side effects of ADCC.","publish_time":"2017-03-21T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ye, Zi-Wei; Yuan, Shuofeng; Poon, Kwok-Man; Wen, Lei; Yang, Dong; Sun, Zehua; Li, Cun; Hu, Meng; Shuai, Huiping; Zhou, Jie; Zhang, Mei-Yun; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Chu, Hin; Yuen, Kwok-Yung","journal":"Front Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d04f10a35adf7daa66ebda57b141ed79abac0a2c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5359280.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28377769/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00317","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjs2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ADCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["elevated ADCC","effects of ADCC","putative ADCC epitopes","high ADCC activities","induction of ADCC response","influenza virus infection","pandemic H1N1 influenza virus","H1N1 influenza virus challenge","E1-vaccinated mice","design of universal influenza vaccines","immunogenic influenza hemagglutinin","infected mice","future design of universal influenza vaccine","virus-infected cells","designated E1","certain domains of HA head region","lungs of H1N1","antiviral activities","data","lung tissue of E1","PBS-vaccinated group","induction of protective immunity","protective effect","secretion of antiviral cytokines","lethal mouse model","increased mouse alveolar damage","exaggerated inflammatory cell infiltration","antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity","balance","E2","viral load","perforin","mortality","upregulated release of cytotoxic granules","sera","important features","chemokines","investigation","phenotype","study"],"language":"en"},

These guidelines were designed to: (1) educate clinicians and patients (or patients\u2019 families) about the differences between viral and bacterial rhinosinusitis; (2) reduce the use of antibiotics for nonbacterial nasal/sinus disease; (3) provide recommendations for the diagnosis and optimal treatment of ABRS; (4) promote the use of appropriate antibiotic therapy when bacterial infection is likely; and (5) describe the current understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics and how they relate to the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. The original guidelines are updated here to include the most recent information on management principles, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and therapeutic options. Burden of disease An estimated 20 million cases of ABRS occur annually in the United States. According to National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data, sinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed. Sinusitis accounted for 9% and 21% of all pediatric and adult antibiotic prescriptions, respectively, written in 2002. The primary diagnosis of sinusitis results in expenditures of approximately $3.5 billion per year in the United States. Definition and diagnosis of ABRS ABRS is most often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Allergy, trauma, dental infection, or other factors that lead to inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses may also predispose individuals to developing ABRS. Patients with a \u201Ccommon cold\u201D (viral URI) usually report some combination of the following symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, facial pressure, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough, ear fullness, fever, and myalgia. A change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of a bacterial infection. Bacterial superinfection may occur at any time during the course of a viral URI. The risk that bacterial superinfection has occurred is greater if the illness is still present after 10 days. Because there may be cases that fall out of the \u201Cnorm\u201D of this typical progression, practicing clinicians need to rely on their clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with symptoms of a viral URI that have not improved after 10 days or worsen after 5 to 7 days. There may be some or all of the following signs and symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness. Physical examination provides limited information in the diagnosis of ABRS. While sometimes helpful, plain film radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging scans are not necessary for cases of ABRS. Microbiology of ABRS The most common bacterial species isolated from the maxillary sinuses of patients with ABRS are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, the latter being more common in children. Other streptococcal species, anaerobic bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus cause a small percentage of cases. Bacterial resistance in ABRS The increasing prevalence of penicillin nonsusceptibility and resistance to other drug classes among S pneumoniae has been a problem in the United States, with 15% being penicillin-intermediate and 25% being penicillin-resistant in recent studies. Resistance to macrolides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is also common in S pneumoniae. The prevalence of \u03B2-lactamase-producing isolates of H influenzae is approximately 30%, while essentially all M catarrhalis isolates produce \u03B2-lactamases. Resistance of H influenzae to TMP/SMX is also common. Antimicrobial treatment guidelines for ABRS These guidelines apply to both adults and children. When selecting antibiotic therapy for ABRS, the clinician should consider the severity of the disease, the rate of progression of the disease, and recent antibiotic exposure. The guidelines now divide patients with ABRS into two general categories: (1) those with mild symptoms who have not received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks, and (2) those with mild disease who have received antibiotics within the past 4 to 6 weeks or those with moderate disease regardless of recent antibiotic exposure. The difference in severity of disease does not imply infection with a resistant pathogen. Rather, this terminology indicates the relative degree of acceptance of possible treatment failure and the likelihood of spontaneous resolution of symptoms\u2014patients with more severe symptoms are less likely to resolve their disease spontaneously. The primary goal of antibiotic therapy is to eradicate bacteria from the site of infection, which, in turn, helps (1) return the sinuses back to health; (2) decrease the duration of symptoms to allow patients to resume daily activities more quickly; (3) prevent severe complications such as meningitis and brain abscess; and (4) decrease the development of chronic disease. Severe or life-threatening infections with or without complications are rare, and are not addressed in these guidelines. Prior antibiotic use is a major risk factor associated with the development of infection with antimicrobial-resistant strains. Because recent antimicrobial exposure increases the risk of carriage of and infection due to resistant organisms, antimicrobial therapy should be based upon the patient\u2019s history of recent antibiotic use. The panel\u2019s guidelines, therefore, stratify patients according to antibiotic exposure in the previous 4 to 6 weeks. Lack of response to therapy at \u226572 hours is an arbitrary time established to define treatment failures. Clinicians should monitor the response to antibiotic therapy, which may include instructing the patient to call the office or clinic if symptoms persist or worsen over the next few days. The predicted bacteriologic and clinical efficacy of antibiotics in adults and children has been determined according to mathematical modeling of ABRS developed by Michael Poole, MD, PhD, based on pathogen distribution, resolution rates without treatment, and in vitro microbiologic activity. Antibiotics can be placed into the following relative rank order of predicted clinical efficacy for adults: 90% to 92% = respiratory fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), ceftriaxone, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg/day), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.75 g/250 mg/day); 83% to 88% = high-dose amoxicillin (4 g/day), amoxicillin (1.5 g/day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime (based on H influenzae and M catarrhalis coverage), cefuroxime axetil, cefdinir, and TMP/SMX; 77% to 81% = doxycycline, clindamycin (based on gram-positive coverage only), azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin, and telithromycin; 65% to 66% = cefaclor and loracarbef. The predicted spontaneous resolution rate in patients with a clinical diagnosis of ABRS is 62%. Antibiotics can be placed into the following relative rank order of predicted clinical efficacy in children with ABRS: 91% to 92% = ceftriaxone, high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/6.4 mg per kg per day) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (45 mg/6.4 mg per kg per day); 82% to 87% = high-dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg per day), amoxicillin (45 mg/kg per day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefixime (based on H influenzae and M catarrhalis coverage only), cefuroxime axetil, cefdinir, and TMP/SMX; and 78% to 80% = clindamycin (based on gram-positive coverage only), cefprozil, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin; 67% to 68% = cefaclor and loracarbef. The predicted spontaneous resolution rate in untreated children with a presumed diagnosis of ABRS is 63%. Recommendations for initial therapy for adult patients with mild disease (who have not received antibiotics in the previous 4 to 6 weeks) include the following choices: amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.75 to 4 g/250 mg per day), amoxicillin (1.5 to 4 g/day), cefpodoxime proxetil, cefuroxime axetil, or cefdinir. While TMP/SMX, doxycycline, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, or telithromycin may be considered for patients with \u03B2-lactam allergies, bacteriologic failure rates of 20% to 25% are possible. Failure to respond to antimicrobial therapy after 72 hours should prompt either a switch to alternate antimicrobial therapy or reevaluation of the patient (see Table 4).When a change in antibiotic therapy is made, the clinician should consider the limitations in coverage of the initial agent. Recommendations for initial therapy for adults with mild disease who have received antibiotics in the previous 4 to 6 weeks or adults with moderate disease include the following choices: respiratory fluoroquinolone (eg, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) or high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (4 g/250 mg per day). The widespread use of respiratory fluoroquinolones for patients with milder disease may promote resistance of a wide spectrum of organisms to this class of agents. Ceftriaxone (parenteral, 1 to 2 g/day for 5 days) or combination therapy with adequate gram-positive and negative coverage may also be considered. Examples of appropriate regimens of combination therapy include high-dose amoxicillin or clindamycin plus cefixime, or high-dose amoxicillin or clindamycin plus rifampin.

The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that the Type A trichothecene T-2 toxin interferes with the gut mucosal immune response to enteric reovirus infection. Mice were exposed i.p. first to 1.75 mg/kg bw T-2 and then 2 h later with 3 \u00D7 107 plaque-forming units of reovirus serotype 1, strain Lang (T1/L). As compared to vehicle-treated control, T-2-treated mice had dramatically elevated intestinal plaque-forming viral titers after 5 days and failed to completely clear the virus from intestine by 10 days. Levels of reovirus \u03BB2 core spike (L2 gene) RNA in feces in T-2-treated mice were significantly higher at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days than controls. T-2 potentiated L2 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner with as little as 50 \u03BCg/kg of the toxin having a potentiative effect. T-2 exposure transiently suppressed induction of reovirus-specific IgA in feces (6 and 8 days) as well as specific IgA and IgG2a in serum (5 days). This suppression corresponded to decreased secretion of reovirus-specific IgA and IgG2a in Peyer\u0027s patch (PP) and lamina propria fragment cultures prepared 5 days after infection. T-2 suppressed IFN-\u03B3 responses in PP to reovirus at 3 and 7 days as compared to infected controls whereas IL-2 mRNA concentrations were unaffected. PP IL-6 mRNA levels were increased 2-fold 2 h after T-2 treatment, but no differences between infected T-2-exposed and infected vehicle-treated mice were detectable over the next 7 days. Overall, the results suggest that T-2 toxin increased both the extent of GI tract reovirus infection and fecal shedding which corresponded to both suppressed immunoglobulin and IFN-\u03B3 responses.","publish_time":"2006-08-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Li, Maoxiang; Cuff, Christopher F.; Pestka, James J.","journal":"Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0a9d2f9ee8975ebde7f6ad413e94aebde6b26746.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7125810.xml.json","url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041008X06000305; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X06000305","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxMDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Lang"],"organizations":["T1/L"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["days","infected T","trichothecene T","bw T","secretion of reovirus","suppressed induction of reovirus","enteric reovirus infection","infected vehicle-treated mice","units of reovirus serotype","extent of GI tract reovirus infection","specific IgA","toxin","mRNA levels","PP IL","infected controls","Levels of reovirus \u03BB2 core spike","vehicle-treated control","suppressed IFN-\u03B3 responses","suppressed immunoglobulin","IgG2a","mRNA concentrations","feces","potentiated L2 mRNA expression","L2 gene","intestinal plaque","gut immunity","gut mucosal immune response","Peyer\u0027s patch","fecal shedding","lamina propria fragment cultures","dose-dependent manner","strain Lang","leukocytes","hypothesis","viral titers","treatment","fold","serum","exposure","T1","differences","Abstract Trichothecenes","research","potentiative effect","\u03BCg","suppression","intestine","results","purpose"],"language":"en"},

It starts by tracing three phases in schistosomiasis control: disease elimination strategy through snail control (1950s-early 1980s); morbidity control strategy based on chemotherapy (mid 1980s to 2003); integrated control strategy (2004\u002B). Each one of these phases took place in distinct policy-making environments. The paper partly draws on these phases to set out five issues of disease control and discusses them in the context of the health system and its recent trends. These cover the policy-making process, intersectoral action for health, equity and access to health services, funding for public goods and externalities, and strengthening resource management and planning. These issues form the basis of an agenda for integrating research and capacity strengthening in the Chinese health system with a view to creating a more positive enabling environment for schistosomiasis control. In so doing it is important to emphasize the role and integrity of the public sector against its commercialization, the underlying value of equity, a systems wide perspective, and the role of advocacy.","publish_time":"2012-11-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Collins, Charles; Xu, Jing; Tang, Shenglan","journal":"Infect Dis Poverty","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c98f64c50d8a1c2d378db2e8da009c2dbc7936b1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3710143.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/2049-9957-1-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23849320/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxMDc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["P.R.

Here we carried out a study of the evolution of protein molecules by investigating homologous relationships among residue segments. The motive was to identify detailed topological features of homologous relationships for short residue segments in the whole protein universe. Based on the data of a large number of non-redundant proteins, the universe of non-membrane polypeptide was analyzed by considering both residue mutations and structural conservation. By connecting homologous segments with edges, we obtained a homologous relationship network of the whole universe of short residue segments, which we named the graph of polypeptide relationships (GPR). Since the network is extremely complicated for topological transitions, to obtain an in-depth understanding, only subgraphs composed of vital nodes of the GPR were analyzed. Such analysis of vital subgraphs of the GPR revealed a donut-shaped fingerprint.

While hand hygiene has been widely promoted within Australia, primary care providers\u2019 (PCPs) and parents\u2019 understanding of hand hygiene importance, and their views on hand hygiene in reducing transmission of diseases in the community are unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the views of PCPs and parents of young children on their knowledge and practice of hand hygiene in disease transmission. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional qualitative research design, we conducted 30 in-depth interviews with PCPs and five focus groups with parents (n = 50) between June 2014 and July 2015 in Melbourne, Australia. Data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: Participants agreed that hand hygiene practice was important in reducing disease transmissions. However, barriers such as variations of hand hygiene habits, relating visibility to transmission; concerns around young children being obsessed with washing hands; children already being \u2018too clean\u2019 and the need to build their immunity through exposure to dirt; and scepticism that hand hygiene practice was achievable in young children, all hindered participants\u2019 motivation to develop good hand hygiene behaviour in young children. CONCLUSION: Despite the established benefits of hand hygiene, sustained efforts are needed to ensure its uptake in routine care. To overcome the barriers identified in this study a multifaceted intervention is needed that includes teaching young children good hand hygiene habits, PCPs prompting parents and young children to practice hand hygiene when coming for an RTI consultation, reassuring parents that effective hand hygiene practice will not lead to abnormal psychological behaviour in their children, and community health promotion education campaigns.","publish_time":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Biezen, Ruby; Grando, Danilla; Mazza, Danielle; Brijnath, Bianca","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4465b8957219de75fb5b7f7ed57069405572cf00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6460784.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30975108/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-6729-x","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsxMTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Australia","Melbourne"],"keyphrases":["practice of hand hygiene","hand hygiene importance","Effective hand hygiene practice","good hand hygiene behaviour","variations of hand hygiene habits","established benefits of hand hygiene","teaching young children good hand hygiene habits","parents of young children","views of PCPs","transmission of diseases","reassuring parents","Australia","study","barriers","gastrointestinal infections","disease transmissions","routine care","respiratory tract infections","abnormal psychological behaviour","primary care providers\u2019","community health promotion education campaigns","hindered participants\u2019 motivation","scepticism","parents\u2019","RTI consultation","visibility","focus groups","knowledge","in-depth interviews","RTIs","dirt","sustained efforts","cross-sectional qualitative research design","exposure","multifaceted intervention","concerns","washing hands","BACKGROUND","need","METHODS","immunity","uptake","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","aim","Melbourne","Data"],"language":"en"},

To explore these interactions a functional high throughput small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen targeting 6719 druggable cellular genes was undertaken to identify host factors (HF) influencing the replication and spread of an eGFP-tagged VACV. The experimental design incorporated a low multiplicity of infection, thereby enhancing detection of cellular proteins involved in cell-to-cell spread of VACV. The screen revealed 153 pro- and 149 anti-viral HFs that strongly influenced VACV replication. These HFs were investigated further by comparisons with transcriptional profiling data sets and HFs identified in RNAi screens of other viruses. In addition, functional and pathway analysis of the entire screen was carried out to highlight cellular mechanisms involved in VACV replication. This revealed, as anticipated, that many pro-viral HFs are involved in translation of mRNA and, unexpectedly, suggested that a range of proteins involved in cellular transcriptional processes and several DNA repair pathways possess anti-viral activity. Multiple components of the AMPK complex were found to act as pro-viral HFs, while several septins, a group of highly conserved GTP binding proteins with a role in sequestering intracellular bacteria, were identified as strong anti-viral VACV HFs.

NiV can cause Acute Lung Injury (ALI) in humans, and human-to-human transmission has been observed in recent outbreaks of NiV. While the exact route of transmission to humans is not known, we have previously shown that NiV can efficiently infect human respiratory epithelial cells. The molecular mechanisms of NiV-associated ALI in the human respiratory tract are unknown. Thus, there is an urgent need for models of henipavirus infection of the human respiratory tract to study the pathogenesis and understand the host responses. Here, we describe a novel human lung xenograft model in mice to study the pathogenesis of NiV. Following transplantation, human fetal lung xenografts rapidly graft and develop mature structures of adult lungs including cartilage, vascular vessels, ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, and primitive \u201Cair\u201D spaces filled with mucus and lined by cuboidal to flat epithelium. Following infection, NiV grows to high titers (10(7) TCID(50)/gram lung tissue) as early as 3 days post infection (pi). NiV targets both the endothelium as well as respiratory epithelium in the human lung tissues, and results in syncytia formation. NiV infection in the human lung results in the production of several cytokines and chemokines including IL-6, IP-10, eotaxin, G-CSF and GM-CSF on days 5 and 7 pi. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that NiV can replicate to high titers in a novel in vivo model of the human respiratory tract, resulting in a robust inflammatory response, which is known to be associated with ALI. This model will facilitate progress in the fundamental understanding of henipavirus pathogenesis and virus-host interactions; it will also provide biologically relevant models for other respiratory viruses.","publish_time":"2014-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valbuena, Gustavo; Halliday, Hailey; Borisevich, Viktoriya; Goez, Yenny; Rockx, Barry","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8d8faf148d930bc5d0b5908b0069c770123109e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3974875.xml.json","url":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24699832/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzczLmNzdjsyMDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":504915,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:06Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fqDvT1BLoPtxVOnL08E\u002BdA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_73.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["ALI"],"organizations":["NiV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["NiV infection","human respiratory tract","pathogenesis of NiV","human lung results","human transmission","human lung tissues","NiV targets","respiratory epithelium","human respiratory epithelial cells","human fetal lung xenografts","novel human lung xenograft model","respiratory viruses","molecular mechanisms of NiV","recent outbreaks of NiV","lethal respiratory illness","models of henipavirus infection","humans","study","Acute Lung Injury","gram lung tissue","high titers","associated ALI","days post infection","genus Henipavirus","fundamental understanding of henipavirus pathogenesis","flat epithelium","high mortality rates","virus-host interactions","ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium","G-CSF","GM-CSF","Nipah virus","relevant models","host responses","exact route of transmission","cartilage","vascular vessels","encephalitis","mice","mature structures of adult lungs","air","member","production","family Paramyxoviridae","mucus","chemokines","eotaxin","cytokines","progress","urgent need","transplantation","endothelium","syncytia formation","spaces","robust inflammatory response","TCID","conclusion"],"language":"en"},

By fluorescent microscopic analysis of the fusion-from-within, we found that fragments of target cells are internalized into Env-expressing cells.

The endocytosis inhibitor also attenuated the fusion-from-without.

A 2 \u00D7 2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used in a switchback design. From December 1 to February 28, cows grazed dormant upland range in 8 pastures (32 \u00B1 2 ha each). The equivalent of 0.45 kg of supplement/cow per d (42% CP) was provided to half of the cows on a pasture basis 3 d/wk. For 30 d before the beginning of breeding (May 1 to May 31), half of the cows grazed a common subirrigated meadow (58 ha), and the remainder was fed grass hay in a drylot. Cow BW and BCS were monitored throughout the year, and steer calf performance was determined until slaughter. Feeding supplement prepartum improved (P = 0.01 to P \u003C 0.001) BCS precalving (5.1 vs. 4.7) and prebreeding (5.1 vs. 4.9) and increased (P = 0.02) the percentage of live calves at weaning (98.5 vs. 93.6%) but did not affect (P = 0.46) pregnancy rate (93 vs. 90%).

This study does not support the hypothesis that magnetic field exposure can promote breast cancer in this rat model.","publish_time":"1999-05-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Boorman, Gary A.; Anderson, Larry E.; Morris, James E.; Sasser, Lyle B.; Mann, Peter C.; Grumbein, Sondra L.; Hailey, James R.; McNally, Alan; Sills, Robert C.; Haseman, Joseph K.","journal":"Carcinogenesis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109974.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109974/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzEwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DMBA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hz fields","Hz groups","Hz magnetic fields","Hz exposure group","mammary tumors","effect of magnetic field exposure","breast cancer initiation","induced breast cancer","ambient fields","Dawley rats","DMBA controls","presence of tumors","Mammary gland masses","female Sprague","field intensity","mammary gland carcinoma incidence","weeks","promotion study","days of age","lowest number","number of fibroadenomas","vehicle control group","body weight gains","time of appearance","difference","sham","dimethylbenz","tumor size","animals","conditions","Gauss","hypothesis","evidence","gavage dose","anthracene","rat model","total numbers of carcinomas","end","Measurement","assay","studies"],"language":"en"},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of Monascus pigment derivatives, which were derived from a microbial secondary metabolite synthesized from polyketides by Monascus spp., as HCV antiviral agents. METHODS: We performed an in vitro RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) assay to screen for HCV RdRp inhibitors. The anti-HCV activity of RdRp inhibitors in HCV-replicating cells was evaluated by quantification of the RNA viral genome. Molecular docking analysis was performed to predict the binding sites of the selected RdRp inhibitors. RESULTS: We have identified a Monascus pigment and its derivatives as inhibitors of the HCV NS5B RdRp. A group of Monascus orange pigment (MOP) amino acid derivatives, in which the reactive oxygen moiety was changed to amino acids, significantly inhibited HCV replication. Further, combination of the MOP derivatives (Phe, Val or Leu conjugates) with interferon (IFN)-\u03B1 inhibited HCV replication more than IFN-\u03B1 treatment alone. Lastly, molecular docking studies indicate the inhibitors may bind to a thumb subdomain allosteric site of NS5B. The antiviral activity of the MOP derivatives was related to a modulation of the mevalonate pathway, since the mevalonate-induced increase in HCV replication was suppressed by the MOP compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify amino acid derivatives of MOP as potential anti-HCV agents and suggest that their combination with IFN-\u03B1 might offer an alternative strategy for the control of HCV replication.","publish_time":"2011-11-09T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sun, Ji-Min; Kim, Seong-Jun; Kim, Geon-Woo; Rhee, Jin-Kyu; Kim, Nam Doo; Jung, Heeyong; Jeun, Jungae; Lee, Seung-Hoon; Han, Seung Hyun; Shin, Chul Soo; Oh, Jong-Won","journal":"J Antimicrob Chemother","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c593559fe08dd809232108172f214205d1b3a436.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7109977.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109977/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzEwNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV","MOP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV RdRp inhibitors","HCV NS5B RdRp","MOP derivatives","control of HCV replication","\u03B1 inhibited HCV replication","anti-HCV activity of RdRp inhibitors","HCV antiviral agents","potential anti-HCV agents","amino acid derivatives of MOP","potential of Monascus pigment derivatives","selected RdRp inhibitors","MOP compounds","IFN-\u03B1 treatment","group of Monascus orange pigment","amino acids","RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","combination","antiviral activity","RESULTS","RNA viral genome","Molecular docking analysis","molecular docking studies","mevalonate pathway","mevalonate-induced increase","thumb subdomain allosteric site of NS5B","assay","infection","chronic liver disease","interferon","Phe","screen","Leu conjugates","Hepatitis C virus","polyketides","alternative strategy","reactive oxygen moiety","major public health problem","binding sites","quantification","OBJECTIVES","modulation","cells","microbial secondary metabolite","CONCLUSIONS","study","aim","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The barrier, a plastic collar wrapped around building support posts, proved highly effective at preventing movement of adult lesser mealworms. Significantly more lesser mealworm larvae were recovered from cardboard collar beetle traps placed below both washed and unwashed barriers than from traps placed above washed and unwashed barriers. Similarly, significantly more adult Dermestes were recovered from traps placed below washed barriers than from above both washed and unwashed barriers. The level of fly specking on the barrier was found to have no significant impact on the numbers of adult lesser mealworms and adult and larval Dermestes recovered either above or below barriers. Fly specking level did significantly impact the numbers of lesser mealworm larvae recovered above the barrier. Although washed barriers provided the greatest deterrent to adult lesser mealworms, the presence of the barrier, regardless of the level of fly specking, provided a significant deterrent to beetle climbing success. Washed barriers further reduced climbing success by lesser mealworm larvae by 17%, Dermestes adults by 7\u201328%, and Dermestes larvae by 33\u201338%. The high level of climbing observed by adult lesser mealworms suggests that the impact of adult beetle movement toward birds should be considered in its importance in building damage, disease transmission, feed infestation, and bird productivity and health.

Amer J Epidem 93: 480\u2013486, 1971.\u2014Monovalent killed influenza A(2) Hong Kong vaccine in doses (400 CCA units) recommended for civilian use was given to insurance company employees and elderly psychiatric patients by injection, nasal spray, or a combination of both methods. Vaccinees and controls were then studied for evidence of immunity to influenza during the 1968\u20131969 epidemic Parenteral vaccination was well tolerated and effective in reducing influenza infection and illness rates in both groups. Vaccine had no effect on total respiratory illness in the insurance group, although total absenteeism was lowered because of the greater effect of influenza over that of colds in causing time lost from work. Vaccine given by spray into the respiratory tract was ineffective. The addition of spray to parenteral vaccination provided no additional advantage over parenteral vaccination alone.","publish_time":"1971-06-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"EDMONDSON, WILLIAM P.; ROTHENBERG, RICHARD; WHITE, PAUL W.; GWALTNEY, JACK M.","journal":"Am J Epidemiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b73b23caf3af4314454807a1d6eab8a555aa6a39.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7110229/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzIyNg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Edmondson","W.

Abstracts were reviewed, and articles discussing use of laboratory tests selected for review. Additional articles were selected from the references. Guideline Preparation and Review: Drafts of the guidelines were posted on the Internet, presented at the AACC Annual Meeting in 1999, and reviewed by experts.

Specific recommendations were made based on analysis of published data and evaluated for strength of evidence and clinical impact. Recommendations: Although many specific recommendations are made in the guidelines, only some summary recommendations are listed here. In acute hepatic injury, prothrombin time and, to a lesser extent, total bilirubin are the best indicators of severity of disease. Although ALT is useful for detecting acute and chronic hepatic injury, it is not related to severity of acute hepatic injury and only weakly related to severity of chronic hepatic injury.

Patients were stratified into groups based on the type of surgery (brain and spine), the occurrence of PPCs and the assess respiratory risk in surgical patients in Catalonia (ARISCAT) score risk for PPCs. RESULTS: Seven hundred eighty-four patients were included in the analysis; 408 patients (52%) underwent spine surgery and 376 patients (48%) brain surgery. Median tidal volume (V(T)) was 8 ml [Interquartile Range, IQR = 7.3\u20139] per predicted body weight; median positive end\u2013expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 5 [3 to 5] cmH(2)0. Planned recruitment manoeuvres were used in the 6.9% of patients. No differences in ventilator settings were found among the sub-groups. PPCs occurred in 81 patients (10.3%). Duration of anaesthesia (odds ratio, 1.295 [95% confidence interval 1.067 to 1.572]; p = 0.009) and higher age for the brain group (odds ratio, 0.000 [0.000 to 0.189]; p = 0.031), but not intraoperative ventilator settings were independently associated with development of PPCs. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical patients are ventilated with low V(T) and low PEEP, while recruitment manoeuvres are seldom applied. Intraoperative ventilator settings are not associated with PPCs.","publish_time":"2020-04-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robba, Chiara; Hemmes, Sabrine N.

The possible development of PI-IBS or PI-FD depends on factors related to both the infection and the host. Microinflammation has been found in patients with post-infectious FGID. Studies performed in animal models show that infection and acute inflammation permanently change gastrointestinal motility and sensitivity. The role of AGE in the development of FGID is important not only because this entity provides an excellent natural model for pathogenic study but also because it provides an opportunity for preventive action.","publish_time":"2011-06-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mearin, Ferm\u00EDn; Balboa, Agust\u00EDn","journal":"Gastroenterol Hepatol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115640.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115640/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzQxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["PI-IBS","PI-FD","development of FGID","possible development of PI","GI infection","post-infectious FGID","Functional gastrointestinal disorders","gastrointestinal motility","studies","development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome","risk of developing IBS","acute inflammation","acute gastroenteritis","functional dyspepsia","role of AGE","excellent natural model","infections","animal models","entity","pathogenic study","patients","sensitivity","factors","opportunity","preventive action","gastroenterology practice","data","Microinflammation","host"],"language":"en"},

Higher levels of both specific (51)Cr release and IFN were obtained in the assays containing PK-15-TGE cells. Co-cultivation of PBL from newborn piglets with PK-15-TGE cells yielded similar levels of IFN to those produced by co-cultivation of adult PBL and PK-15-TGE cells, but lower levels of IFN were produced by co-cultivation with uninfected PK-15 cells. Pretreatment of adult PBL with IFN augmented their SCMC effector activity for both PK-15 and PK-15-TGE cells in the (51)Cr release assay. Pretreatment of the PK-15-TGE target cells with IFN did not affect their release of (51)Cr in the SCMC reaction, while IFN pretreatment of PK-15 targets protected them against SCMC. In a single cell cytotoxicity assay the effects of IFN pretreatment on the effector adult PBL and on the PK-15 and PK-15-TGE target cells were confirmed, and SCMC incompetent PBL from neonatal piglets were rendered cytotoxic by pretreatment with IFN.

This qualitative study employs a social-ecological framework to examine how macro (historical, legislative, political, socio-economic factors), meso (sources of information, social support, social mobilization) and micro level factors (individual actions, behavioral changes) interacted to influence the response and behavior of women with respect to Zika in different contexts. METHODS: A qualitative study was carried out. Women were recruited through the snowball sampling technique from various locations in Brazil, Puerto Rico, and the United States. They were of different nationalities and ethnicities. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The data transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Women in this study deemed the information provided as insufficient, which led them to actively reach out and access a variety of media sources. Social networks played a vital role in sharing information but also resulted in the spread of hoaxes or rumors. Participants in our research perceived socio-economic inequities but focused on how to remedy their microenvironments. They did not engage in major social activities. Lack of trust in governments placed women in vulnerable situations by preventing them to follow the guidance of health authorities. These impacts were also a result of the response tactics of health and government administrations in their failed attempts to ensure the well-being of their countries\u2019 populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings call for public health interventions that go beyond individual level behavioral change campaigns, to more comprehensively address the broader meso and macro level factors that influence women\u2019 willingness and possibility to protect themselves.","publish_time":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Linde-Arias, Ana Rosa; Roura, Maria; Siqueira, Eduardo","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/470f5305c205bb7eccd88eaa208140c0ceefe29e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118940.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7118940/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzUyMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Brazil","United States"],"keyphrases":["macro level factors","social mobilization","public health response","social support","Social networks","behavior of women","micro level factors","response tactics of health","socio-economic factors","sources of information","qualitative study","public health interventions","social-ecological framework","major social activities","individual level preventative measures","individual level behavioral change campaigns","individual actions","sharing information","guidance of health authorities","Zika outbreak","behavioral changes","broader meso","socio-economic inequities","data transcripts","different contexts","different nationalities","variety of media sources","various locations","vector control","Puerto Rico","Brazil","government administrations","respect","snowball sampling technique","epidemiological surveillance","governments","vital role","failed attempts","well-being","findings","willingness","Lack of trust","vulnerable situations","United States","semi-structured interviews","thematic analysis","Participants","research","BACKGROUND","spread of hoaxes","rumors","countries\u2019 populations","ethnicities","CONCLUSIONS","possibility","METHODS","RESULTS","impacts","microenvironments"],"language":"en"},

The acute phase response is comprised of reactions localized at the site of infection, as well as the initiation of systemic responses, which include a rapid increase in the serum concentration of some proteins, known as acute phase proteins (APP). Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we detected two APP of approximately 22 and 37 kDa molecular weight in sera obtained from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Based on their presence in the sera of sick, but not normal animals, the molecular weights, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and the ability to bind hemoglobin, we identified these proteins as the \u03B1 and \u03B2 subunits of haptoglobin. The haptoglobin molecule and the \u03B1 subunit were isolated from serum, purified, and used to produce monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. With these reagents, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure the concentration of haptoglobin in bovine serum. Using an experimental model of BRD induced by a sequential challenge of calves with bovine herpesvirus type-1 and Pasteurella haemolytica, we observed a temporal relationship between the increase in haptoglobin concentration in serum and the onset of bacterial infection. The haptoglobin concentration ranged from undetectable in the serum of most calves prior to challenge, to greater than 1 mgml(\u22121) in over one-third of the calves at the height of disease. Furthermore, the concentration of haptoglobin was associated significantly with other measures of the severity of disease. Together, these results indicate that quantification of acute phase proteins in animals with BRD could be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic aid.","publish_time":"1996-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Godson, Dale L.; Campos, Manuel; Attah-Poku, Samuel K.; Redmond, Mark J.; Cordeiro, Daphne M.; Sethi, Manjeet S.; Harland, Richard J.; Babiuk, Lorne A.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119716/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzYwOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pasteurella"],"organizations":["BRD"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["concentration of haptoglobin","haptoglobin concentration","serum concentration","bovine serum","acute phase response","haptoglobin molecule","quantification of acute phase proteins","\u03B2 subunits of haptoglobin","bovine respiratory disease","sequential challenge of calves","host response","APP","severity of disease","height of disease","bovine herpesvirus type","experimental model of BRD","molecular weights","normal animals","rapid increase","sera of sick","\u03B1 subunit","site of infection","kDa molecular weight","onset of bacterial infection","N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis","cattle","infectious agents","Pasteurella haemolytica","temporal relationship","reactions","valuable diagnostic","number of physiologic changes","ability","immunosorbent assay","early stages","initiation of systemic responses","reagents","enzyme","prognostic aid","measures","results","polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis","polyclonal antibodies","presence","mgml","hemoglobin"],"language":"en"},

Based upon our current understanding of this rather complex disease, the knowledge that is currently being generated in the basic science of stone disease offers the promise of minimizing patient suffering. But the technology and information are expanding at incomprehensible rates. METHODS: This is a history of technology and information systems themselves. This history is absolutely fascinating and deserves a spot in the lexicon of the history of urolithiasis because it is the future of management of this ancient malady and best hope for the future. A review of the errors of complex systems and the application to medicine and surgery centers on the notion of six sigma (six standard deviations from the norm). This is a statistical reference to improving outcomes. RESULTS: This chapter jumps to the history of modern electronics, computers, the rise of the Internet, and artificial intelligence and how it might be applied to urolithiasis. By necessity, complex systems in turn tend to focus on the complications and unintended consequences of the technology. Therefore, some attention will be paid to complications, medical malpractice, and the notion of human error. CONCLUSIONS: This concluding chapter brings us up-to-date in the technologies that will evolve and modify our current perceptions of stone disease. This includes the surgical and medical methods that will evolve in conjunction with the technologies that will drive all of the future of medicine, intelligent technology. The notion of convergence will be developed and presented and why such luminaries as Bill Joy have become so pessimistic about the future.","publish_time":"2013-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moran, Michael E.","journal":"Urolithiasis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/884fd0f693eff81c503385b485fa117087366c9b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7120875.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120875/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Bill"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["history of technology","complex disease","fascinating history","history of urolithiasis","future of medicine","future of management","bright future","current perceptions of stone disease","information systems","intelligent technology","history of modern electronics","errors of complex systems","basic science of stone disease","complications","chapter","notion of convergence","medical methods","technologies","notion of human error","medical malpractice","current understanding","ancient malady","rise","computers","application","best hope","promise of minimizing patient suffering","Internet","sigma","turn","OBJECTIVE","standard deviations","surgery centers","Bill Joy","unintended consequences","conjunction","lexicon","review","necessity","spot","INTRODUCTION","artificial intelligence","incomprehensible rates","statistical reference","outcomes","luminaries","norm","knowledge","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","attention"],"language":"en"},

Recognition that the sphingomyelin/ceramide transducer calibrates extent of tissue injury, ultimately acting as a molecular switch that determines organ fate, is driving development of new pharmacologic concepts and tools to intervene therapeutically.","publish_time":"2012-11-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hua, Guoqiang; Kolesnick, Richard","journal":"Sphingolipids in Disease","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/397176c0ed002268a316e8a0051edb16400c5ef1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121422.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121422/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2OzY5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Recognition"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ceramide transducer","ceramide signal transduction","ceramide generation governing injury","key initiator of sphingomyelin","clinical relevance of sphingomyelin","numerous diseases","stress stimuli","extent of tissue injury","transduction of organotypic responses","ASMase knockout mice","evolutionary conservation of sphingolipid stress","gut","tumor","brain","ovary","mammalian adaptations","heart","lung","development of new pharmacologic concepts","organ fate","disease states","liver","tools","pathway","chapter","molecular switch","Recognition","Acid sphingomyelinase","decades"],"language":"en"},

Proteins also serve as the predominant target class for the design of small molecule drugs to modulate their activity. Knowledge of the shape and form of proteins, by means of their three-dimensional structures, is therefore instrumental to understanding their roles in disease and their potentials for drug development.

We summarize how the wealth of structure information, contributed to a large extent by the technological advances in structure determination to date, serves as a useful tool to decipher the molecular basis of genetic variations for disease characterization and diagnosis, particularly in the emerging era of genomic medicine, and becomes an integral component in the modern day approach towards rational drug development.","publish_time":"2012-05-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yue, Wyatt W.; Froese, D.

The complications covered in this chapter generally occur within 100 days post HSCT and are thus classified as early complications. Two of the most common early complications are oral complications/mucositis and sepsis. Some other relatively rare complications are also covered here: haemorrhagic cystitis (HC), endothelial damage (ED) syndromes including engraftment syndrome (ES), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH), transplant-associated microangiopathy (TAM) and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (SOS/VOD).

The plasma membrane-bound carboxypeptidase activity which occurs at neutral optimum pH levels was found to be enhanced by CoCl(2) and inhibited by guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid, o-phenanthroline, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and cadmium acetate; whereas the soluble carboxypeptidase activity which occurs at an optimum pH level of 5.0 was not activated by CoCl(2) and only slightly inhibited by o-phenanthroline, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, NiCl(2) and CdCl(2). The latter activity was presumably due to lysosomal cathepsin B, which is known to be present in the soluble fraction of hog intestinal mucosa. Although the membrane-bound enzyme was evenly distributed along the small intestine, it was not anchored in the phospholipidic bilayer via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moiety, as carboxypeptidase M from human placenta is. The enzyme was not solubilized by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, but was solubilized to practically the same extent by several detergents. The purified trypsin-solubilized form is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 200 kDa, as determined by performing SDS\u2013PAGE and gel filtration, which differs considerably from the molecular mass of human placental carboxypeptidase M (62 kDa). It was found to cleave lysyl bonds more rapidly than arginyl bonds, which is not so in the case of carboxypeptidase M, and immunoblotting analysis provided further evidence that hog intestinal and human placental membrane-bound carboxypeptidases do not bear much resemblance to each other. Since the latter enzyme has been called carboxypeptidase M, it is suggested that the former might be carboxypeptidase D, the recently described new member of the carboxypeptide B-type family.","publish_time":"1999-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dalle Ore, Florence; Ajandouz, El Hassan; Giardina, Thierry; Puigserver, Antoine","journal":"Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7124209.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124209/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozc2MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["soluble carboxypeptidase activity","carboxypeptidase D","case of carboxypeptidase","plasma membrane-bound carboxypeptidase activity","molecular mass of human placental carboxypeptidase","membrane-bound enzyme","human placental membrane-bound carboxypeptidases","ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid","soluble fraction of hog intestinal mucosa","o-phenanthroline","guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid","kDa","CoCl","neutral optimum pH levels","lysyl bonds","arginyl bonds","purified trypsin-solubilized form","glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol moiety","lysosomal cathepsin B","carboxypeptide B-type family","phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C","cadmium acetate","release of basic COOH-terminal amino acids","new member","glycoprotein","evidence","NiCl","short peptides","SDS","immunoblotting analysis","phospholipidic bilayer","PAGE","gel filtration","distinct enzymes","resemblance","small intestine","extent","detergents","CdCl"],"language":"en"},

The 1000-fold improvement in resolution provided by electron microscopy (EM) has allowed visualization of viruses, the existence of which had previously only been suspected as the causative agents of transmissible infectious disease. Viruses are grouped into families based on their morphology. Viruses from different families look different and these morphological variances are the basis for identification of viruses by EM. Electron microscopy initially came to prominence in diagnostic microbiology in the late 1960s when it was used in the rapid diagnosis of smallpox, by differentiating, on a morphological basis, poxviruses from the less problematic herpesviruses in skin lesions. Subsequently, the technique was employed in the diagnosis of other viral infections, such as hepatitis B and parvovirus B19. Electron microscopy has led to the discovery of many new viruses, most notably the various viruses associated with gastroenteritis, for which it remained the principal diagnostic method until fairly recent times. Development of molecular techniques, which offer greater sensitivity and often the capacity to easily process large numbers of samples, has replaced EM in many areas of diagnostic virology. Hence the role of EM in clinical virology is evolving with less emphasis on diagnosis and more on research, although this is likely only to be undertaken in specialist centres. However, EM still offers tremendous advantages to the microbiologist, both in the speed of diagnosis and the potential for detecting, by a single test, any viral pathogen or even multiple pathogens present within a sample. There is continuing use of EM for the investigation of new and emerging agents, such as SARS and human monkeypox virus. Furthermore, EM forms a vital part of the national emergency response programme of many countries and will provide a frontline diagnostic service in the event of a bioterrorism incident, particularly in the scenario of a deliberate release of smallpox virus. In the field of bacteriology, EM is of little use diagnostically, although some bacterial pathogens can be identified in biopsy material processed for EM examination. Electron microscopy has been used, however, to elucidate the structure and function of many bacterial features, such as flagellae, fimbriae and spores and in the study of bacteriophages. The combined use of EM and gold-labelled antibodies provides a powerful tool for the ultrastructural localisation of bacterial and viral antigens.","publish_time":"2005-11-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Curry, Alan; Appleton, Hazel; Dowsett, Barry","journal":"Micron","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126980.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126980/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozg1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EM","SARS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["EM examination","role of EM","combined use of EM","continuing use of EM","new viruses","identification of viruses","various viruses","visualization of viruses","Transmission electron microscopy","bacterial pathogens","diagnostic microbiology","speed of diagnosis","areas of diagnostic virology","rapid diagnosis of smallpox","viral pathogen","bacterial features","viral antigens","viral infections","principal diagnostic method","frontline diagnostic service","morphological basis","little use","different families","ultrastructural localisation of bacterial","emerging agents","morphological variances","investigation of new","clinical virology","deliberate release of smallpox virus","multiple pathogens present","human monkeypox virus","causative agents of transmissible infectious disease","powerful tool","countries","gold-labelled antibodies","scenario","hepatitis B","event","SARS","national emergency response programme","prominence","resolution","problematic herpesviruses","profound impact","biopsy material","spores","capacity","greater sensitivity","fimbriae","flagellae","recent times","poxviruses","knowledge","emphasis","discovery","bioterrorism incident","single test","fold improvement","Development of molecular techniques","large numbers of samples","microbiologist","skin lesions","parvovirus B19","structure","function","research","potential","tremendous advantages","field of bacteriology","study of bacteriophages","gastroenteritis","existence","specialist centres","morphology"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: The LAMP primer set was designed from E. histolytica hemolysin gene HLY6. Genomic DNA of E. histolytica trophozoites strain HK9 was used to optimize the LAMP mixture and conditions. Amplification of DNA in the LAMP mixture was monitored through visual inspection for turbidity of the LAMP mix as well as addition of fluorescent dye. RESULTS: Positive LAMP reactions turned turbid while negative ones remained clear. Upon addition of a fluorescent dye, all positive reactions turned green while the negative control remained orange under ambient light. After elecrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels, a ladder of multiple bands of different sizes can be observed in positive samples while no bands were detected in the negative control. The sensitivity of the assay was found to be 5 parasites per reaction which corresponds to approximately 15.8 ng/\u03BC L DNA. The specificity of the assay was verified by the absence of amplified products when DNA from other gastrointestinal parasites such as the morphologically similar but non-pathogenic species, Entamoeba dispar 39, and other diarrhea-causing organisms such as Blastocystis hominis and Escherichia coli were used. CONCLUSIONS: The LAMP assay we have developed enables the detection of E. histolytica with rapidity and ease, therefore rendering it is suitable for laboratory and field diagnosis of amebiasis.","publish_time":"2013-05-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rivera, Windell L.; Ong, Vanissa A.","journal":"Asian Pac J Trop Med","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7128414/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzguY3N2Ozk1NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1224389,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:52Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"3BNQpGdkcF6wZitC2IaIgg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_8.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LAMP"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["LAMP mixture","Positive LAMP reactions","assay","detection of Entamoeba histolytica","LAMP primer set","Amplification of DNA","positive reactions","negative control","Genomic DNA of","histolytica trophozoites strain HK9","negative ones","histolytica hemolysin gene HLY6","positive samples","addition of fluorescent dye","Entamoeba dispar","gastrointestinal parasites","isothermal amplification","causative agent of amebiasis","field diagnosis of amebiasis","ladder of multiple bands of different sizes","orange","visual inspection","Blastocystis hominis","agarose gels","absence of amplified products","organisms","laboratory","diarrhea","non-pathogenic species","ambient light","loop","RESULTS","Escherichia coli","ease","METHODS","turbidity","rapidity","elecrophoresis","conditions","OBJECTIVE","sensitivity","specificity","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Six and twelve hours after inoculation, before diarrhea, extensive specific viral immunofluorescence and viral particles on electron microscopy were seen in villus but not crypt enterocytes in jejunum, mid-intestine, and ileum. At 24 and 40 hr, when diarrhea was most severe, immunofluorescence was patchy; villus blunting (P \u003C 0.001) and increased crypt depth (P \u003C 0.001) were observed by light microscopy in all segments; radioautographically labeled enterocytes showed accelerated migration and shortened life span; and cells on villi were deficient in sucrose activity (P \u003C 0.001) and rich in thymidine kinase activity (P \u003C 0.005), suggesting relative immaturity. Villus structure recovered by 72 and 144 hr, although deeper crypts (P \u003C 0.001) and accelerated migration still persisted. We conclude that extensive, almost simultaneous direct viral invasion of villus enterocytes can occur along the entire length of the small intestine after a single exposure to virus, and thus can cause shedding of mature villus cells and proliferation and accelerated migration of cells from the crypts. At the height of diarrhea, when enterocyte turnover is maximal, the epithelium consists predominantly of immature virus-free cells which have migrated to the villi in a relatively undifferentiated state.","publish_time":"2020-02-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Shepherd, R.W.; Butler, D.G.; Cutz, E.; Gall, D.G.; Hamilton, J.R.","journal":"Gastroenterology","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130309/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzI3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Villus structure","accelerated migration of cells","villus blunting","height of diarrhea","shedding of mature villus cells","simultaneous direct viral invasion of villus enterocytes","viral particles","small intestine","crypt enterocytes","extensive specific viral immunofluorescence","immature virus-free cells","extent of epithelial viral invasion","mid-intestine","villi","hr","single oral inoculum of virus","sucrose activity","electron microscopy","single exposure","mucosal structure","light microscopy","deeper crypts","thymidine kinase activity","increased crypt depth","proliferation","shortened life span","timing","jejunum","piglets","infection","differentiation","epithelium","enterocyte turnover","entire length","TGE","human rotavirus enteritis","documented abnormalities of ion transport","alterations","kinetics","findings","inoculation","segments","transmissible gastroenteritis","ileum","undifferentiated state","hours","relative immaturity"],"language":"en"},

Such vaccines are practical and effective because (1) most fatal ETEC infections in farm animals occur in the early neonatal period when the antibody titres in colostrum and milk are highest; (2) more than 90% of the ETEC in farm animals belong to a small family of fimbrial antigen types: (3) fimbriae consist of good protein antigens on the bacterial surface where they are readily accessible to antibody; (4) fimbriae are required for a critical step (adhesion-colonization) early in the pathogenesis of the disease. ETEC infections continue to be a significant clinical problem in farm animals in spite of extensive use of fimbriae-based vaccines. Definitive data on the efficacy of the commercial vaccines in field use are not available. The prevailing perception among animal health professionals is that the vaccines are effective, that the problem occurs chiefly among non-vaccinated animals, and that in some herds vaccination moves peak prevalence of disease from the first to the second or third week after birth, when mortality is lower. It has been suggested that extensive use of vaccines will rapidly select for the emergence of novel or previously low prevalence fimbrial antigen types. There is no evidence that this has happened after a decade of routine vaccine use in the United States. However, there is no active direct surveillance for such emergence. In contrast to the rational development of vaccines to provide passive lacteal protection against ETEC in suckling neonates, comparatively little progress has been made in providing the knowledge required for development of vaccines to protect against postweaning ETEC infections in swine.","publish_time":"2002-11-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Moon, Harley W.; Bunn, Thomas O.","journal":"Vaccine","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130883/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzM2OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Escherichia coli"],"organizations":["ETEC"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["Fimbrial vaccines","extensive use of vaccines","commercial vaccines","based vaccines","rational development of vaccines","fatal ETEC infections","postweaning ETEC infections","farm animals","spite of extensive use of fimbriae","field use","non-vaccinated animals","swine","low prevalence fimbrial antigen types","small family of fimbrial antigen types","decade of routine vaccine use","peak prevalence of disease","suckling neonates","antibody titres","emergence of novel","suckling newborn calves","significant clinical problem","early neonatal period","pigs","lambs","passive lacteal protection","enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli","animal health professionals","bacterial surface","colostrum","good protein antigens","sheep","efficacy","herds vaccination","prevailing perception","milk","critical step","United States","adhesion-colonization","little progress","pregnant cattle","birth","mortality","active direct surveillance","contrast","Definitive data","week","pathogenesis","knowledge","evidence"],"language":"en"},

The disappearance of these structures observed under scanning electron microscopy or in cryofracture preparations in vivo and in vitro cannot be reversed by the action of cytochalasin B on the microfilament network. The decrease in the porosity seems to be related directly to the productive infection of the endothelial cells, because it was not observed in A/J mice resistant to the virus and in susceptible BALB/c mice immunized with a thermosensitive mutant in which no viral replication occurs.

A similar response was seen in situ at 12\u00B0C and 16\u00B0C where fusion of transition vesicles with cis Golgi apparatus, but not their formation, was blocked and transition vesicles accumulated in large numbers. At 18\u00B0C and below and especially at 8\u00B0C and 12\u00B0C, the cells responded by accumulating smooth tubular transitional membranes near the cis Golgi apparatus face. With cells and tissue slices at 20\u00B0C neither transition vesicles nor the smooth tubular elements accumulated. Those transition vesicles which formed at 37\u00B0C were of a greater diameter than those formed at 4\u00B0C both in situ and in vitro. The findings show parallel responses between the temperature dependency of transition vesicle formation in vitro and in situ and suggest that a subpopulation of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum may be morphologically and functionally homologous to the 16\u00B0C compartment observed in virally-infected cell lines grown at low temperatures.","publish_time":"2006-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Morr\u00E9, D.

There is a corresponding diversity in the pathological lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) produced by acute virus infection. Infection can be pictured as a race between virus and host defenses, where many factors, acting through different mechanisms, can influence the outcome. Outcome is always determined by multiple virus and host variables, although single variables can be independently studied under experimentally controlled conditions in the laboratory. The chapter demonstrates that in many virus-host combinations, the immune response plays an important role in recovery from primary infections.

No exposure-related cytogenetic effects were present in male or female rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm.

Minimal histopathologic effects were present in the livers of rats exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm. Decreased amyloidosis was observed in the liver and other organs in hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm.

DI particles and related satellite genomes of the plant RNA viruses are generated by a wide variety of animal, plant, and fungal viruses. The ubiquity of DI viruses was first clearly recognized by Huang and Baltimore. They proposed and defined the term \u201CDI particle\u201D to include defective viruses containing only some portion of the infectious virus genome, requiring homologous parental virus as a helper for the replication, containing virus structural proteins and antigens, and exhibiting the capacity to replicate preferentially at the expense of infectious helper virus in cells infected by both. Satellite RNAs of plants are small RNAs that usually share little or no homology with their helper viruses, although some do exhibit some sequence homology with their helper viruses, and thus resemble DI particles in at least a portion of their genomes. Depending on the leaving sites and resumption sites, DI particles can be produced that are simple internal deletions of the virus genome, simple deletions with a new terminus, or complex or bizarre genomes with multiple rearrangements of the virus segments. DI viruses and defective viruses generally are widespread in nature. Laboratory studies show that they can sometimes exert powerful disease-modulating effects (either attenuation or intensification of symptoms).

It focuses on the interplay between viral and cellular mRNAs and the translational machinery. That interplay, together with the intrinsic structure of viral mRNAs, determines the patterns of translation in infected cells. It also points out some possibilities for translational regulation that can only be glimpsed at present, but are likely to come into focus in the future. The mechanism of selecting the initiation site for protein synthesis appears to follow a single formula. The translational machinery displays a certain flexibility that is exploited more frequently by viral than by cellular mRNAs. Although some of the parameters that determine efficiency have been identified, how efficiently a given mRNA will be translated cannot be predicted by summing the known parameters.","publish_time":"2008-03-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kozak, Marilyn","journal":"Adv Virus Res","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131717/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzUxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["translation of viral mRNAs","cellular mRNAs","intrinsic structure of viral mRNAs","translational machinery","protein synthesis","translational regulation","interplay","patterns of translation","given mRNA","known parameters","initiation site","structural features","infected cells","certain flexibility","single formula","focus","chapter","mechanism","possibilities","present","future","proteins","efficiency"],"language":"en"},

Simulation is a cost- and time-effective way of predicting the evolution of the infection as the joint influence of many different factors: interaction patterns, personal characteristics, travel patterns, meteorological conditions, previous vaccination, etc. The work presented in this paper extends EpiGraph, our influenza epidemic simulator, by introducing a meteorological model as a modular component that interacts with the rest of EpiGraph\u2019s modules to refine our previous simulation results. Our goal is to estimate the effects of changes in temperature and relative humidity on the patterns of epidemic influenza based on data provided by the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System (SISSS) and the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET). METHODS: Our meteorological model is based on the regression model developed by AB and JS, and it is tuned with influenza surveillance data obtained from SISSS. After pre-processing this data to clean it and reconstruct missing samples, we obtain new values for the reproduction number of each urban region in Spain, every 10 minutes during 2011. We simulate the propagation of the influenza by setting the date of the epidemic onset and the initial influenza-illness rates for each urban region. RESULTS: We show that the simulation results have the same propagation shape as the weekly influenza rates as recorded by SISSS. We perform experiments for a realistic scenario based on actual meteorological data from 2010-2011, and for synthetic values assumed under simplified predicted climate change conditions. Results show that a diminishing relative humidity of 10% produces an increment of about 1.6% in the final infection rate. The effect of temperature changes on the infection spread is also noticeable, with a decrease of 1.1% per extra degree.Conclusions: Using a tool like ours could help predict the shape of developing epidemics and its peaks, and would permit to quickly run scenarios to determine the evolution of the epidemic under different conditions. We make EpiGraph source code and epidemic data publicly available.","publish_time":"2020-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Singh, David E.; Marinescu, Maria-Cristina; Carretero, Jesus; Delgado-Sanz, Concepcion; Gomez-Barroso, Diana; Larrauri, Amparo","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f4de27e0660ffd7f15e0336a349a68539f1cf2a5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132999.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7132999/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU0MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EpiGraph","Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System","AB","SISSS"],"locations":["Spain"],"keyphrases":["epidemic data","patterns of epidemic influenza","influenza epidemic simulator","influenza surveillance data","meteorological conditions","meteorological model","actual meteorological data","epidemic onset","weekly influenza rates","SISSS","infection propagation effects","previous simulation results","initial influenza-illness rates","Spanish Meteorological Agency","Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System","different conditions","propagation shape","infection spread","travel patterns","interaction patterns","regression model","effects of changes","urban region","evolution","final infection rate","diminishing relative humidity","effect of temperature changes","different factors","new values","previous vaccination","synthetic values","simplified predicted climate change conditions","EpiGraph source code","shape of developing epidemics","personal characteristics","better plan","reproduction number","joint influence","realistic scenario","prediction","health institutions","rest of EpiGraph\u2019s modules","time-effective way","cost","Spain","work","modular component","paper","extra degree","missing samples","Conclusions","decrease","peaks","JS","AEMET","date","response capabilities","tool","experiments","minutes","details","METHODS","BACKGROUND","scenarios","goal","increment"],"language":"en"},

The intestinal epithelium represents a good model system in which the glycosylation process can be studied. The intestinal epithelium is composed of two basic epithelial cell types: the absorptive enterocyte and the mucus-producing goblet cell. Gastrointestinal epithelial renewal ensues through the processes of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. This renewal occurs in discrete proliferative zones along the gastrointestinal tract. In the small intestine, this proliferative zone is restricted to the base of the crypts, whereas in the large intestine it is less restrictive, occurring in the basal two thirds of the crypt. A longitudinal section along the crypt-to-surface axis, cells in various degrees of differentiation is observed, providing a unique in vivo system in which to investigate differentiation-related glycosylation events. The glycoconjugate repertoire displayed by a given cell reflects its endogenous expression of glycosyltransferases. The role played by terminal oligosaccharide structures in cell\u2013cell recognition phenomena and the expression of glycosyltransferases occupy a key position in the post-translational processing of glycoconjugates and thus influence cellular function.","publish_time":"2008-02-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Taatjes, Douglas J.; Roth\u2020, J\u00FCrgen","journal":"Int Rev Cytol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133219/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzU2MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["given cell","goblet cell","intestinal epithelium","cell recognition phenomena","processes of cell proliferation","basic epithelial cell types","Gastrointestinal epithelial renewal","glycosylation reactions","glycosylation process","differentiation-related glycosylation events","endogenous expression of glycosyltransferases","various degrees of differentiation","gastrointestinal tract","large intestine","small intestine","discrete proliferative zones","good model system","key position","absorptive enterocyte","terminal oligosaccharide structures","post-translational processing of glycoconjugates","surface axis","cells","mucus","migration","role","crypts","base","glycoconjugate repertoire","cellular function","longitudinal section","thirds","chapter"],"language":"en"},

The complete nucleotide sequence of the \u201CP\u2253 gene has been obtained and is found to contain two open reading frames, neither of which is large enough to encode the P protein. We have shown that the P and V proteins are translated from two mRNAs that differ by the presence of two nontemplated G residues in the P mRNA. These two additional nucleotides convert the two open reading frames to one of 392 amino acids. The P and V proteins are amino coterminal and have 164 amino acids in common. The unique C terminus of V consists of a cysteine-rich region that resembles a cysteine-rich metal binding domain.

Four of the nine previously challenge-exposed cats were negative for virus-neutralizing antibodies against FIPV at the time of intradermal (ID) testing for DTH. Two other cats tested for DTH when acutely ill with clinical FIP did not have cutaneous DTH responses to FIPV. Gross skin reactions to FIPV injected ID were observed in six of nine asymptomatic cats (67%) at postintradermal inoculation hours (PIH) 24, 48, and/or 72. The reactions consisted of focal, 1\u20135-mm to 2.5-cm diameter indurated or semi-firm, nonerythematous, slightly raised nodules. Microscopically, DTH-like reactions were observed in biopsies taken from the FIPV-inoculated skin of asymptomatic cats at PIH 24 to 72. The lesions consisted of perivascular and diffuse dermal infiltrations by macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). The dermal infiltrates, which were maximal at PIH 48 or 72, were predominantly mixed inflammatory cells (five of nine cats) or PMN (four of nine cats) at PIH 24, but later were predominantly mononuclear cells (six of nine cats) or mixed inflammatory cells (two of nine cats) at PIH 72. Five of nine cats (56%) with positive DTH skin responses had increased survival times after lethal ID challenge-exposure with FIPV compared to mean survival times in FIPV-naive, non-immune control cats that were DTH-negative when ID challenge-exposed. Four of nine DTH-positive cats (44%) resisted an ID challenge-exposure dose of FIPV that was fatal in both control cats, and two of the four remaining DTH-positive cats survived a third challenge-exposure with highly lethal doses of FIPV given intraperitoneally. Four of the six DTH-positive cats (67%) that died after re-challenge and were necropsied had lesions of noneffusive FIP, suggesting that cellular immunity may also be involved in the pathogenesis of noneffusive disease, whereas both control cats and both DTH-negative cats with clinical disease succumbed to effusive FIP.

Monoclonal antibodies to bovine immunoglobulin isotypes of proven specificity were used as conjugated or catching antibody. Five days after oral inoculation (dpi) of a 5-day-old gnotobiotic calf with rotavirus, IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted in faeces, followed 5 days later by IgA rotavirus antibodies. The increase in IgM rotavirus antibody titre coincided with the inability to detect further rotavirus excretion. Faeces IgM and IgA rotavirus antibody titres fell to low levels within 3 weeks post infection. IgG(1) and IgG(2) rotavirus antibodies were not detected in faecal samples. In serum, antibodies to rotavirus of all four isotypes were detected, starting with IgM at 5 dpi. Two SPF-calves, which were fed colostrum free of rotavirus antibodies, were vaccinated with a modified live rotavirus vaccine and challenged with virulent rotavirus 6 days later. Upon vaccination, the calves showed an antibody response similar to the response of the infected gnotobiotic calf. Intestinal IgM rotavirus antibodies were excreted before or on the day of challenge and appeared to be associated with protection against challenge infection with virulent virus and rotavirus-induced diarrhoea. In 3 control calves, which were challenged only, the antibody patterns also resembled that of the gnotobiotic calf and again the appearance of IgM rotavirus antibodies coincided with the end of the rotavirus detection period. Two other groups of 3 SPF-calves were treated similarly, but the calves were fed colostrum with rotavirus antibodies during the first 48 h of life. These calves excreted passively acquired IgG(1) and IgG(2) rotavirus antibodies in their faeces from 2 to 6 days after birth. After vaccination, no IgM or IgA antibody activity in serum or faeces was detectable. Upon challenge, all calves developed diarrhoea and excreted rotavirus. Seven to 10 days after challenge low levels of IgM rotavirus antibody were detected for a short period. These data indicate that the intestinal antibody response of young calves to an enteric viral infection is associated with the excretion of IgM antibodies, immediately followed by IgA antibodies. This response is absent or diminished in calves with passively acquired specific antibodies which may explain the failure to induce a protective intestinal immune response by oral vaccination with modified live rotavirus of calves fed colostrum containing rotavirus antibodies.","publish_time":"2002-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Van Zaane, Dick; Ijzerman, Johan; De Leeuw, Peter W.","journal":"Vet Immunol Immunopathol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133758/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY2NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["IgA rotavirus antibodies","excreted rotavirus","Intestinal IgM rotavirus antibodies","virulent rotavirus","rotavirus excretion","appearance of IgM rotavirus antibodies","IgM rotavirus antibody titre","colostrum free of rotavirus antibodies","IgA antibodies","IgA rotavirus antibody titres","modified live rotavirus of calves","rotavirus detection period","excretion of IgM antibodies","rotavirus-induced diarrhoea","specific antibodies","challenge low levels of IgM rotavirus antibody","Monoclonal antibodies","modified live rotavirus vaccine","Faeces IgM","systemic antibody response of calves","SPF-calves","intestinal antibody response of young calves","control calves","antibody response similar","IgA antibody activity","antibody patterns","days","detection of IgG","challenge infection","protective intestinal immune response","oral vaccination","day of challenge","infected gnotobiotic calf","day-old gnotobiotic calf","serum","enteric viral infection","virulent virus","oral inoculation","short period","isotype-specific ELISAs","bovine immunoglobulin isotypes of proven specificity","end","failure","inability","protection","increase","weeks","data","faecal samples","h of life","groups","birth"],"language":"en"},

Digestive disorders connected with BHV1 are in general only observed in calves and mainly in Belgium. Virus strains causing abortion or encephalitis are only present in a few countries. The same is true for BHV1 induced mastitis. Dermatitis and lesions in the interdigital space seem to be a rare event. BHV1 infections are frequently complicated by bacterial secondary infections, but there is evidence that BHV1 infections can occur simultaneously with bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD) and/or parainfluenza-3 (PI 3) virus. The biggest problem associated with BHV1 infection is the ability of the agent to become latent following a primary infection. The genome of the virus probably remains during the life of the animal in the ganglia of the region where the primary infection occurred. No vaccination can overcome this latent stage. By prophylactic vaccination it is possible to prevent an outbreak of clinical disease but it is impossible to prevent infection followed by the establishment of latency. Eradication programmes in Austria, Denmark and Switzerland have removed most of the seropositive cattle from the bovine populations. Currently a sanitary programme is also being conducted in Germany.","publish_time":"2002-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Straub, Otto Christian","journal":"Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133897/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2OzY4NQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Europe","Belgium","Austria","Denmark","Switzerland","Germany"],"keyphrases":["BHV1 infections","primary infection","BHV1 induced mastitis","Virus strains","bovine virus diarrhoea","bacterial secondary infections","disease pattern","respiratory tract","genital tract","bovine populations","latent stage","prophylactic vaccination","outbreak of clinical disease","encephalitis","interdigital space","Austria","Denmark","Switzerland","ganglia","diseases","abortion","BVD","region","agent","Europe","ability","evidence","Eradication programmes","seropositive cattle","Dermatitis","lesions","animal","intensity","prevalence","life","biggest problem","rare event","Digestive disorders","calves","parainfluenza","countries","establishment of latency","sanitary programme","Germany","Belgium","genome"],"language":"en"},

The present work addressed the effects of IDPN on tasks requiring the use of spatial information. Separate groups of male rats were dosed with IDPN (IP, in 1 ml/kg saline) for 3 consecutive days and tested in the following procedures: (a) step-through passive avoidance conditioning (0, 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg/day); (b) Morris water maze (MWM) acquisition and retention (0, 125, 150, 175, and 200 mg/kg/day); (c) radial arm maze (RAM) acquisition (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (d) RAM steady-state performance (0, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (e) repeated acquisition in the RAM (0, and 200 mg/kg/day). The vestibular toxicity of IDPN resulted in alterations in spontaneous behavior or swimming deficits in 5 of 8 rats treated with 175 mg/kg/day and in all the animals dosed with 200 or 400 mg/kg/day. IDPN increased step-through PA latencies at 200 mg/kg/day but not at lower doses. In the MWM, no performance deficits were observed at the dose levels preserving the swimming ability of the animals. In both the acquisition and the steady-state RAM tasks, IDPN (400 mg/kg/day) induced an increase in both choice errors and perseverative errors. In the RAM repeated acquisition paradigm, IDPN (200 mg/kg/day) induced performance deficits that included a decreased rate of within-session reduction in errors. The present data show that IDPN disrupts performance of tasks requiring spatial learning and memory and indicate that these deficits can be in part caused by an acquisition deficit.","publish_time":"2002-11-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Llorens, Jordi; Crofton, Kevin M.; Peele, David B.","journal":"Neurotoxicol Teratol","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134946/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozg5OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["IDPN","RAM"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["effects of IDPN","performance deficits","IDPN increased step","performance of tasks","RAM repeated acquisition paradigm","acquisition deficit","vestibular toxicity of IDPN","RAM steady-state performance","steady-state RAM tasks","swimming deficits","MWM","spatial learning","choice errors","perseverative errors","memory","animals","swimming ability","Separate groups of male rats","present work","present data","Morris water maze","radial arm maze","use of spatial information","alterations","decreased rate","spontaneous behavior","dose levels","session reduction","PA latencies","consecutive days","following procedures","passive avoidance conditioning","retention","saline","lower doses","Iminodipropionitrile"],"language":"en"},

Six nursing home norovirus outbreaks occurring in South Carolina, U.S. from 2014 to 2016 were examined. We aimed to quantify the contribution of symptoms and other case characteristics in norovirus transmission using the reproduction number (R(Ei)) as an estimate of individual case infectivity and to examine how transmission changes over the course of an outbreak. Individual estimates of R(Ei) were calculated using a maximum likelihood procedure to infer the average number of secondary cases generated by each case. The associations between case characteristics and R(Ei) were estimated using a weighted multivariate mixed linear model. Outbreaks began with one to three index case(s) with large estimated R(Ei)\u2019s (range: 1.48 to 8.70) relative to subsequent cases. Of the 209 cases, 155 (75%) vomited, 164 (79%) had diarrhea, and 158 (76%) were nursing home residents (vs. staff). Cases who vomited infected 2.12 (95% CI: 1.68, 2.68) times the number of individuals as non-vomiters, cases with diarrhea infected 1.39 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.87) times the number of individuals as cases without diarrhea, and resident-cases infected 1.53 (95% CI: 1.15, 2.02) times the number of individuals as staff-cases. Index cases tended to be residents (vs. staff) who vomited and infected considerably more secondary cases compared to non-index cases. Results suggest that individuals, particularly residents, who vomit are more infectious and tend to drive norovirus transmission in U.S. nursing home norovirus outbreaks. While diarrhea also plays a role in norovirus transmission, it is to a lesser degree than vomiting in these settings. Results lend support for prevention and control measures that focus on cases who vomit, particularly if those cases are residents.","publish_time":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Adams, Carly; Young, David; Gasta\u00F1aduy, Paul A.; Paul, Prabasaj; Marsh, Zach; Hall, Aron J.; Lopman, Benjamin A.","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/88449101d4c40d01dc551a4a46f259654cbf953a.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dc45d351db0fb2527a9804ed3afb51f9b7893e6d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7135310.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135310/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzkuY3N2Ozk4Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":764588,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:43Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"NF43zkQYpLczHQHVS8onXA==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_9.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Carolina","U.S."],"keyphrases":["staff-cases","resident-cases","subsequent cases","non-index cases","average number of secondary cases","norovirus transmission","number of individuals","diarrhea","nursing home norovirus outbreaks","norovirus transmissibility","role of individual case characteristics","nursing home residents","reproduction number","times","estimate of individual case infectivity","Individual estimates of R","transmission changes","large estimated R","Results","non-vomiters","contribution of symptoms","control measures","South Carolina","weighted multivariate mixed linear model","support","prevention","maximum likelihood procedure","demographics","course","range","associations","lesser degree","settings"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: Rice-based diets, containing 60% ordinary grocery rice, MingHui63, or TT51 by weight, were given to parental rats (15 males/30 females each group) for 70 days prior mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. After weaning, eight male offspring rats were randomly selected at each group and fed with diets correspondent to their parents\u2019 for 70 days. The effects of exposure to TT51 on male reproductive system of offspring rats were assessed through sperm parameters, testicular function enzyme activities, serum hormones (FSH, LH, and testosterone levels), testis histopathological examination, and the relative expression levels of selected genes along the hypothalamic-pituitary- testicular (HPT) axis. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in body weight, food intake, organ/body weights, serum hormone, sperm parameters, testis function enzyme ACP, LDH, and SDH activities, testis histopathological changes, and relative mRNA expression levels of GnRH-R, FSH-R, LH-R, and AR along the HPT axis.

However, the mechanism of viral sensing in the liver that promotes these cytokine and cellular responses has remained unclear. Studies here were undertaken to investigate the role of nucleic acid-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in initiating antiviral immunity in the liver during infection with MCMV. We examined the host response of UNC93B1 mutant mice, which do not signal properly through TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9, to acute MCMV infection to determine whether liver antiviral defense depends on signaling through these molecules. Infection of UNC93B1 mutant mice revealed reduced production of systemic and liver proinflammatory cytokines including IFN-\u03B1, IFN-\u03B3, IL-12 and TNF-\u03B1 when compared to wild-type. UNC93B1 deficiency also contributed to a transient hepatitis later in acute infection, evidenced by augmented liver pathology and elevated systemic alanine aminotransferase levels. Moreover, viral clearance was impaired in UNC93B1 mutant mice, despite intact virus-specific CD8\u002B T cell responses in the liver. Altogether, these results suggest a combined role for nucleic acid-sensing TLRs in promoting early liver antiviral defense during MCMV infection.","publish_time":"2012-06-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Crane, Meredith J.; Gaddi, Pamela J.; Salazar-Mather, Thais P.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/acb470a7f8d734e4f257454a90cbb1d933d8bebf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3377622.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3377622/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["acute infection","acute MCMV infection","early liver antiviral defense","Infection of UNC93B1 mutant mice","augmented liver pathology","liver proinflammatory cytokines","UNC93B1 deficiency","host response of UNC93B1 mutant mice","nucleic acid-sensing TLRs","IFN-\u03B1","role of nucleic acid-sensing Toll","initiating antiviral immunity","mechanism of viral sensing","cellular responses","IFN-\u03B3","TNF-\u03B1","complex cytokine","combined role","cellular interactions","viral clearance","reduced production of systemic","T cell responses","hepatotropic virus murine cytomegalovirus","intact virus-specific CD8","elevated systemic alanine aminotransferase levels","receptors","TLR9","transient hepatitis","TLR7","results","wild-type","TLR3","molecules","Studies"],"language":"en"},

Genome sequences from other Mtb strains and closely related bacteria present an opportunity to apply the power of comparative genomics to understand the evolution of Mtb pathogenesis. We conducted a comparative analysis using 31 genomes from the Tuberculosis Database (TBDB.org), including 8 strains of Mtb and M. bovis, 11 additional Mycobacteria, 4 Corynebacteria, 2 Streptomyces, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, Nocardia farcinia, Acidothermus cellulolyticus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bifidobacterium longum. RESULTS: Our results highlight the functional importance of lipid metabolism and its regulation, and reveal variation between the evolutionary profiles of genes implicated in saturated and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. It also suggests that DNA repair and molybdopterin cofactors are important in pathogenic Mycobacteria. By analyzing sequence conservation and gene expression data, we identify nearly 400 conserved noncoding regions. These include 37 predicted promoter regulatory motifs, of which 14 correspond to previously validated motifs, as well as 50 potential noncoding RNAs, of which we experimentally confirm the expression of four. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of protein evolution highlights gene families that are associated with the adaptation of environmental Mycobacteria to obligate pathogenesis. These families include fatty acid metabolism, DNA repair, and molybdopterin biosynthesis. Our analysis reinforces recent findings suggesting that small noncoding RNAs are more common in Mycobacteria than previously expected. Our data provide a foundation for understanding the genome and biology of Mtb in a comparative context, and are available online and through TBDB.org.","publish_time":"2012-03-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"McGuire, Abigail Manson; Weiner, Brian; Park, Sang Tae; Wapinski, Ilan; Raman, Sahadevan; Dolganov, Gregory; Peterson, Matthew; Riley, Robert; Zucker, Jeremy; Abeel, Thomas; White, Jared; Sisk, Peter; Stolte, Christian; Koehrsen, Mike; Yamamoto, Robert T; Iacobelli-Martinez, Milena; Kidd, Matthew J; Maer, Andreia M; Schoolnik, Gary K; Regev, Aviv; Galagan, James","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/28bec3efe92c8567992ee35baecf2dc42bbc34ae.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3388012.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3388012/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzUzNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBDB.org"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Mtb strains","strains of Mtb","biology of Mtb","evolution of Mtb pathogenesis","comparative analysis","pathogenic Mycobacteria","additional Mycobacteria","DNA repair","unsaturated fatty acid metabolism","small noncoding RNAs","adaptation of environmental Mycobacteria","potential noncoding RNAs","comparative context","gene expression data","RESULTS","analysis of protein evolution highlights gene families","pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis","power of comparative genomics","conserved noncoding regions","molybdopterin cofactors","functional importance of lipid metabolism","molybdopterin biosynthesis","sequence conservation","Tuberculosis Database","Genome sequences","validated motifs","predicted promoter regulatory motifs","Nocardia farcinia","Acidothermus cellulolyticus","Rhodobacter sphaeroides","Rhodococcus jostii RHA1","Propionibacterium acnes","Streptomyces","strain H37Rv","Corynebacteria","recent findings","evolutionary profiles of genes","variation","opportunity","regulation","related bacteria","genomes","bovis","Bifidobacterium longum","CONCLUSIONS","foundation","decade","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients with laboratory confirmed Penicilliummarneffei infection admitted to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi, Vietnam, between July 2006 and September 2009. RESULTS: 127 patients with P. marneffei infection were identified. All were HIV-infected; median CD4\u002B T-cell count was 24 cells/\u03BCl (IQR:12-48); 76% were men. Common clinical features were fever (92.9%), skin lesions (82.6%), hepatomegaly (61.4%), lymphadenopathy (40.2%), weight loss (59.1%) and cough (49.6%). Concurrent opportunistic infections were present in 22.0%; half of those had tuberculosis.

Here, we report a synergic effect between Flt3L and low-dose rapamycin (Rapa) in the protection of allograft rejction. It was found that Flt3L combined with Rapa significantly prolonged murine cardiac allograft survival time as compared with that of untreated recipients or recipients treated with Rapa or Flt3L alone. Mechanistic studies revealed that Flt3L combined with low-dose of Rapa induced the generation of tolerogenic DCs along with the production of CD25(\u002B) Foxp3(\u002B) regulatory T cells and IL-10 secretion. We also observed enhanced autophagy in the cardiac allograft, which could be another asset contributing to the enhanced allograft survival.

While some viruses are capable of causing morphological changes to infected cells (e.g. cytopathic effect)which are detectable by microscopy some viral contaminations result in the integration of the viral genome as provirus, this causes no visual evidence, by means of modification of the cellular morphology. Virus production from such cell lines, are potentially dangerous for other cell cultures (in research labs)by cross contaminations, or for operators and patients (in the case of the production of injectable biologicals) because of potential infection. The only way to keep cell cultures for research, development, and the biotech industry virus-free is the prevention of such contaminations. Cell cultures can become contaminated by the following means: firstly, they may already be contaminated as primary cultures (because the source of the cells was already infected), secondly, they were contaminated due to the use of contaminated raw materials, or thirdly, they were contaminated via an animal passage. This overview describes the problems and risks associated with viral contaminations in animal cell culture, describes the origins of these contaminations as well as the most important virsuses associated with viral contaminations in cell culture. In addition, ways to prevent viral contaminations as well as measures undertaken to avoid and assess risks for viral contaminations as performed in the biotech industry are briefly described.","publish_time":"2002-01-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Merten, O.-W.","journal":"Cytotechnology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec779809dc042024897aa083f3fe46212af59946.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463984/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYxMw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["viral contaminations","infected cell cultures","cross contaminations","viral genome","cell lines","animal cell culture","primary cultures","infected cells","risks","Virus production","viruses","use of contaminated raw materials","biotech industry virus-free","research labs","animal passage","following means","production of injectable biologicals","development","morphological changes","lack of effective methods","case","provirus","cytopathic effect","integration","modification","operators","serious threat","prevention","source","microscopy","problems","origins","important virsuses","potential infection","visual evidence","contrast","microbes","mycoplasma","difficulty","patients","addition","ways","measures","cellular morphology","overview"],"language":"en"},

Wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses, which may occasionally result in novel infections of domestic animals and/or the human population. Given this background, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of wild Suid known to move between national parks and farmland, in Uganda. RESULTS: Application of 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a GB Hepatitis C\u2013like virus, and a Sclerotinia hypovirulence-associated-like virus in sera from the bushpigs. PCR assays for each specific virus combined with Sanger sequencing revealed two TTSuV-1 variants, one TTSuV-2 variant as well as PPV4 in the serum samples and thereby confirming the findings from the 454 sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Using a viral metagenomic approach we have made an initial analysis of viruses present in bushpig sera and demonstrated for the first time the presence of PPV4 in a wild African Suid.

In this study, we used African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and Ixodes scapularis tick cells (ISE6) to compare virus-induced changes in mammalian and arthropod cells. Using confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron tomography (ET), we examined viral protein distribution and the ultrastructural changes that occur during TBFV infection. Within host cells, flaviviruses cause complex rearrangement of cellular membranes for the purpose of virus replication. Virus infection was accompanied by a marked expansion in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) staining and markers for TBFV replication were localized mainly to the ER in both cell lines. TEM of Vero cells showed membrane-bound vesicles enclosed in a network of dilated, anastomosing ER cisternae. Virions were seen within the ER and were sometimes in paracrystalline arrays. Tubular structures or elongated vesicles were occasionally noted. In acutely and persistently infected ISE6 cells, membrane proliferation and vesicles were also noted; however, the extent of membrane expansion and the abundance of vesicles were lower and no viral particles were observed. Tubular profiles were far more prevalent in persistently infected ISE6 cells than in acutely infected cells. By ET, tubular profiles, in persistently infected tick cells, had a cross-sectional diameter of 60\u2013100 nm, reached up to 800 nm in length, were closed at the ends, and were often arranged in fascicle-like bundles, shrouded with ER membrane. Our experiments provide analysis of viral protein localization within the context of both mammalian and arthropod cell lines as well as both acute and persistent arthropod cell infection. Additionally, we show for the first time 3D flavivirus infection in a vector cell line and the first ET of persistent flavivirus infection.","publish_time":"2012-10-24T00:00:00Z","authors":"Offerdahl, Danielle K.; Dorward, David W.; Hansen, Bryan T.; Bloom, Marshall E.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8b13309e21cd13564b46ef8d78bf927cf558f6f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3480448.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3480448/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYyNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBFV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["infected cells","arthropod cells","infected ISE6 cells","infected tick cells","host cells","ER membrane","TEM of Vero cells","TBFV infection","Ixodes scapularis tick cells","persistent arthropod cell infection","mammalian","membrane-bound vesicles","ET of persistent flavivirus infection","arthropod cell lines","D flavivirus infection","African green monkey kidney cells","abundance of vesicles","elongated vesicles","membrane proliferation","TBFV replication","Tubular profiles","extent of membrane expansion","anastomosing ER cisternae","vector cell line","virus-induced changes","viral protein distribution","tick hosts","viral particles","purpose of virus replication","Tubular structures","nm","analysis of viral protein localization","transmission electron microscopy","ultrastructural changes","confocal microscopy","marked expansion","electron tomography","Tick-borne flaviviruses","flaviviruses cause complex rearrangement of cellular membranes","staining","context","endoplasmic reticulum","network of dilated","markers","cross-sectional diameter","experiments","cycling","nature","study","time","bundles","length","paracrystalline arrays","ends","fascicle","Virions"],"language":"en"},

The mechanism of PM-mediated pathophysiology remains unknown. However, PM is proinflammatory to the endothelium and increases vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo via ROS generation. OBJECTIVES: We explored the role of tight junction proteins as targets for PM-induced loss of lung endothelial cell (EC) barrier integrity and enhanced cardiopulmonary dysfunction. METHODS: Changes in human lung EC monolayer permeability were assessed by Transendothelial Electrical Resistance (TER) in response to PM challenge (collected from Ft. McHenry Tunnel, Baltimore, MD, particle size \u003E0.1 \u03BCm). Biochemical assessment of ROS generation and Ca(2\u002B) mobilization were also measured. RESULTS: PM exposure induced tight junction protein Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) relocation from the cell periphery, which was accompanied by significant reductions in ZO-1 protein levels but not in adherens junction proteins (VE-cadherin and \u03B2-catenin). N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC, 5 mM) reduced PM-induced ROS generation in ECs, which further prevented TER decreases and atteneuated ZO-1 degradation. PM also mediated intracellular calcium mobilization via the transient receptor potential cation channel M2 (TRPM2), in a ROS-dependent manner with subsequent activation of the Ca(2\u002B)-dependent protease calpain. PM-activated calpain is responsible for ZO-1 degradation and EC barrier disruption. Overexpression of ZO-1 attenuated PM-induced endothelial barrier disruption and vascular hyperpermeability in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that PM induces marked increases in vascular permeability via ROS-mediated calcium leakage via activated TRPM2, and via ZO-1 degradation by activated calpain. These findings support a novel mechanism for PM-induced lung damage and adverse cardiovascular outcomes.","publish_time":"2012-08-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ting; Wang, Lichun; Moreno-Vinasco, Liliana; Lang, Gabriel D; Siegler, Jessica H; Mathew, Biji; Usatyuk, Peter V; Samet, Jonathan M; Geyh, Alison S; Breysse, Patrick N; Natarajan, Viswanathan; Garcia, Joe G N","journal":"Part Fibre Toxicol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c7381949988848cde1902400531425daad42d6b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3489700.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3489700/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzYzNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Zona"],"organizations":["ROS","EC","Ft.

However, several lines of evidence suggest that UL44 might have additional roles during virus life cycle. To shed light on this, we searched for cellular partners of UL44 by yeast two-hybrid screenings. Intriguingly, we discovered the interaction of UL44 with Ubc9, an enzyme involved in the covalent conjugation of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier) to cellular and viral proteins. We found that UL44 can be extensively sumoylated not only in a cell-free system and in transfected cells, but also in HCMV-infected cells, in which about 50% of the protein resulted to be modified at late times post-infection, when viral genome replication is accomplished. Mass spectrometry studies revealed that UL44 possesses multiple SUMO target sites, located throughout the protein. Remarkably, we observed that binding of UL44 to DNA greatly stimulates its sumoylation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we showed that overexpression of SUMO alters the intranuclear distribution of UL44 in HCMV-infected cells, and enhances both virus production and DNA replication, arguing for an important role for sumoylation in HCMV life cycle and UL44 function(s). These data report for the first time the sumoylation of a viral processivity factor and show that there is a functional interplay between the HCMV UL44 protein and the cellular sumoylation system.","publish_time":"2012-11-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sinigalia, Elisa; Alvisi, Gualtiero; Segr\u00E9, Chiara V.; Mercorelli, Beatrice; Muratore, Giulia; Winkler, Michael; Hsiao, He-Hsuan; Urlaub, Henning; Ripalti, Alessandro; Chiocca, Susanna; Pal\u00F9, Giorgio; Loregian, Arianna","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9fb9a39c7e68fd9c32ab53a6a6ce9af6f1fd2e09.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3499415.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3499415/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY0MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SUMO","HCMV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCMV UL44 protein","binding of UL44","UL44 function","interaction of UL44","cellular partners of UL44","viral DNA polymerase subunit UL44","intranuclear distribution of UL44","DNA replication","HCMV-infected cells","HCMV life cycle","viral genome replication","cellular sumoylation system","viral proteins","viral processivity factor","virus life cycle","overexpression of SUMO","transfected cells","polymerase catalytic subunit","covalent conjugation of SUMO","replication of human cytomegalovirus","key role","important role","multiple SUMO target sites","virus production","cell-free system","Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier","late times post-infection","additional roles","yeast","Mass spectrometry studies","functional interplay","Ubc9","hybrid screenings","data report","lines of evidence","holoenzyme","light"],"language":"en"},

Several Salmonella serovars seem to be able to infect water buffalo, but Salmonella isolates collected from this animal species have been poorly characterized. In the present study, the prevalence of Salmonella spp. in water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis was assessed, and a polyphasic characterization of isolated strains of S. Typhimurium was performed. RESULTS: The microbiological analysis of the intestinal contents obtained from 248 water buffalo calves affected by lethal gastroenteritis exhibited a significant prevalence of Salmonella spp. (25%), characterized by different serovars, most frequently Typhimurium (21%), Muenster (11%), and Give (11%). The 13 S. Typhimurium isolates were all associated with enterocolitis characterized by severe damage of the intestine, and only sporadically isolated with another possible causative agent responsible for gastroenteritis, such as Cryptosporidium spp., Rotavirus or Clostridium perfringens. Other Salmonella isolates were mostly isolated from minor intestinal lesions, and often (78% of cases) isolated with other microorganisms, mainly toxinogenic Escherichia coli (35%), Cryptosporidium spp. (20%) and Rotavirus (10%). The S. Typhimurium strains were characterized by phage typing and further genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of 24 virulence genes. The isolates exhibited nine different phage types and 10 different genetic profiles. Three monophasic S. Typhimurium (B:4,12:i:-) isolates were also found and characterized, displaying three different phage types and three different virulotypes. The molecular characterization was extended to the 7 S. Muenster and 7 S. Give isolates collected, indicating the existence of different virulotypes also within these serovars. Three representative strains of S. Typhimurium were tested in vivo in a mouse model of mixed infection. The most pathogenic strain was characterized by a high number of virulence factors and the presence of the locus agfA, coding for a thin aggregative fimbria. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that Salmonella is frequently associated with gastroenteritis in water buffalo calves, particularly S. Typhimurium. Moreover, the variety in the number and distribution of different virulence markers among the collected S. Typhimurium strains suggests that within this serovar there are different pathotypes potentially responsible for different clinical syndromes.","publish_time":"2012-10-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borriello, Giorgia; Lucibelli, Maria G; Pesciaroli, Michele; Carullo, Maria R; Graziani, Caterina; Ammendola, Serena; Battistoni, Andrea; Ercolini, Danilo; Pasquali, Paolo; Galiero, Giorgio","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/854e623d1f875e4605b2ffd3f72599d063a56cc0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3514206.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3514206/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY1Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Salmonella","S.

Using a mouse model of hepatitis C, we examined the therapeutic effects of a recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) that encodes an HCV protein. We generated immunocompetent mice that each expressed multiple HCV proteins via a Cre/loxP switching system and established several distinct attenuated rVV strains. The HCV core protein was expressed consistently in the liver after polyinosinic acid\u2013polycytidylic acid injection, and these mice showed chronic hepatitis C-related pathological findings (hepatocyte abnormalities, accumulation of glycogen, steatosis), liver fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunization with one rVV strain (rVV-N25), which encoded nonstructural HCV proteins, suppressed serum inflammatory cytokine levels and alleviated the symptoms of pathological chronic hepatitis C within 7 days after injection. Furthermore, HCV protein levels in liver tissue also decreased in a CD4 and CD8 T-cell-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, we showed that rVV-N25 immunization induced a robust CD8 T-cell immune response that was specific to the HCV nonstructural protein 2. We also demonstrated that the onset of chronic hepatitis in CN2-29((\u002B/\u2212))/MxCre((\u002B/\u2212)) mice was mainly attributable to inflammatory cytokines, (tumor necrosis factor) TNF-\u03B1 and (interleukin) IL-6. Thus, our generated mice model should be useful for further investigation of the immunological processes associated with persistent expression of HCV proteins because these mice had not developed immune tolerance to the HCV antigen. In addition, we propose that rVV-N25 could be developed as an effective therapeutic vaccine.","publish_time":"2012-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sekiguchi, Satoshi; Kimura, Kiminori; Chiyo, Tomoko; Ohtsuki, Takahiro; Tobita, Yoshimi; Tokunaga, Yuko; Yasui, Fumihiko; Tsukiyama-Kohara, Kyoko; Wakita, Takaji; Tanaka, Toshiyuki; Miyasaka, Masayuki; Mizuno, Kyosuke; Hayashi, Yukiko; Hishima, Tsunekazu; Matsushima, Kouji; Kohara, Michinori","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c24570f542d59b0d17450b1bd83c708f9401ca9c.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3524174.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3524174/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzY2OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HCV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["HCV antigen","HCV protein levels","HCV nonstructural protein","nonstructural HCV proteins","HCV core protein","multiple HCV proteins","hepatitis C virus","onset of chronic hepatitis","rVV-N25 immunization","symptoms of pathological chronic hepatitis C","persistent expression of HCV proteins","mouse model of hepatitis C","chronic hepatitis C-related pathological findings","immunocompetent mice","generated mice model","distinct attenuated rVV strains","liver fibrosis","liver tissue","robust CD8 T-cell immune response","polycytidylic acid injection","inflammatory cytokines","polyinosinic acid","immune tolerance","therapeutic effects","suppressed serum inflammatory cytokine levels","recombinant vaccinia virus","effective therapeutic vaccine","hepatocyte abnormalities","tumor necrosis factor","accumulation of glycogen","TNF-\u03B1","immunological processes","steatosis","system","loxP","CD4","days","investigation","dependent manner","infection","interleukin","hepatocellular carcinoma","CN2","global health problem","IL","results","addition","MxCre"],"language":"en"},

Recurrence of the disease is likely and cornea transplantation, therefore, might not be the ideal therapeutic solution. This paper will focus on the current situation of ocular gene therapy research against herpetic keratitis, including the use of viral and nonviral vectors, routes of delivery of therapeutic genes, new techniques, and key research strategies. Whereas the correction of inherited diseases was the initial goal of the field of gene therapy, here we discuss transgene expression, gene replacement, silencing, or clipping. Gene therapy of herpetic keratitis previously reported in the literature is screened emphasizing candidate gene therapy targets. Commonly adopted strategies are discussed to assess the relative advantages of the protective therapy using antiviral drugs and the common gene therapy against long-term HSV-1 ocular infections signs, inflammation and neovascularization.

Our current understanding of the epidemiology of these infections is limited by reliance on data from decades ago performed using low-sensitivity laboratory methods, and recent studies reporting severe, hospital-managed disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) study is an ongoing study enrolling a dynamic birth cohort to document the community-based epidemiology of viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in early childhood. Women are recruited antenatally, and their healthy newborn is followed for the first 2 years of life. Parents keep a daily symptom diary for the study child, collect a weekly anterior nose swab and dirty nappy swab and complete a burden diary when a child meets pre-defined illness criteria. Specimens will be tested for a wide range of viruses by real-time PCR assays. Primary analyses involves calculating incidence rates for acute respiratory illness (ARI) and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) for the cohort by age and seasonality. Control material from children when they are without symptoms will allow us to determine what proportion of ARIs and AGE can be attributed to specific pathogens. Secondary analyses will assess the incidence and shedding duration of specific respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens.

Wistar rats and C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized by sevoflurane inhalation. Lung fragments were then collected and incubated at 37\u00B0C in a continuously gassed (with 95% O(2):5% CO(2)) Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) or Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Phosphorescence O(2) analyzer that measured dissolved O(2) concentration as a function of time was used to monitor the rate of cellular mitochondrial O(2) consumption. Cellular ATP content was measured using the luciferin/luciferase system. The caspase-3 substrate N-acetyl-asp-glu-val-asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) was used to monitor intracellular caspase activity; cleaved AMC moieties (reflecting caspase activity) were separated on HPLC and detected by fluorescence. Lung histology and immunostaining with anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody were also performed. RESULTS: For Wistar rats, the values of k(c) and ATP for 0 \u003C t \u2264 7 h (mean \u00B1 SD) were 0.15 \u00B1 0.02 \u03BCM O(2) min(-1) mg(-1) (n = 18, coefficient of variation, Cv = 13%) and 131 \u00B1 69 pmol mg(-1) (n = 16, Cv = 53%), respectively. The AMC peak areas remained relatively small despite a ~5-fold rise over 6 h. Good tissue preservation was evident despite time-dependent increases in apoptotic cells. Lung tissue bioenergetics, caspase activity and structure were deleterious in unoxygenated or intermittently oxygenated solutions. Incubating lung tissue in O(2) depleted MEM for 30 min or anesthesia by urethane had no effect on lung bioenergetics, but produced higher caspase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Lung tissue bioenergetics and structure could be maintained in vitro in oxygenated buffer for several hours and, thus, used as biomarkers for investigating respiratory pathogens or toxins.","publish_time":"2013-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Alsuwaidi, Ahmed R; Alsamri, Mohammed T; Alfazari, Ali S; Almarzooqi, Saeeda; Albawardi, Alia; Othman, Aws R; Pramathan, Thachillath; Hartwig, Stacey M; Varga, Steven M; Souid, Abdul-Kader","journal":"BMC Res Notes","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5a6799cac3abf5a147241dc238dba56b9cb0b3fb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3557141.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3557141/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzcxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ATP","AMC","HPLC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["lung bioenergetics","lung tissue bioenergetics","intracellular caspase activity","reflecting caspase activity","higher caspase activity","Incubating lung tissue","Lung histology","Lung fragments","dissolved O","\u03BCM O","Phosphorescence O","anti-cleaved caspase","rate of cellular mitochondrial O","Cellular ATP content","Good tissue preservation","cleaved AMC moieties","structure","toxins","cellular respiration","Wistar rats","oxygenated buffer","Cv","effects of respiratory pathogens","AMC peak areas","substrate N-acetyl","val-asp","asp-glu","function of time","depleted MEM","oxygenated solutions","luciferase system","time-dependent increases","Krebs-Henseleit buffer","mice","immunostaining","anesthesia","apoptotic cells","methylcoumarin","fold rise","concentration","luciferin","urethane","analyzer","CONCLUSIONS","Minimal Essential Medium","Ac-DEVD","SD","mean","C57Bl","coefficient of variation","values","biomarkers","antibody","consumption","HPLC","study","sevoflurane inhalation","hours","RESULTS","BACKGROUND","fluorescence","pmol"],"language":"en"},

HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) gene has a critical role in HTLV-1 infectivity and the development of ATL and HAM/TSP. However, little is known about the immune response against HBZ in HTLV-1-infected individuals. In this study, we examined antibody responses against HBZ in serum/plasma samples from 436 subjects including HTLV-1 seronegative donors, asymptomatic carriers (AC), ATL, and HAM/TSP patients using the luciferase immunoprecipitation system. RESULTS: Immunoreactivity against HBZ was detected in subsets of all HTLV-1-infected individuals but the test did not discriminate between AC, ATL and HAM/TSP. However, the frequency of detection of HBZ-specific antibodies in the serum of ATL patients with the chronic subtype was higher than in ATL patients with the lymphomatous subtype. Antibody responses against HBZ were also detected in cerebrospinal fluid of HAM/TSP patients with anti-HBZ in serum. Antibody responses against HBZ did not correlate with proviral load and HBZ mRNA expression in HAM/TSP patients, but the presence of an HBZ-specific response was associated with reduced CD4(\u002B) T cell activation in HAM/TSP patients. Moreover, HBZ-specific antibody inhibited lymphoproliferation in the PBMC of HAM/TSP patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report demonstrating humoral immune response against HBZ associated with HTLV-I infection.

There is essentially no understanding of how combinations of genotypes affect symptom expression and disease severity. We know little about the evolution of the genotypes that have been characterized to date, little about the biological role of their diversity and particularly, about the effects of recombination. Additionally, genotype grouping has not been standardized. In this study we utilized an extensive array of CTV genomic information to classify the major genotypes, and to determine the major evolutionary processes that led to their formation and subsequent retention. Our analyses suggest that three major processes act on these genotypes: (1) ancestral diversification of the major CTV lineages, followed by (2) conservation and co-evolution of the major functional domains within, though not between CTV genotypes, and (3) extensive recombination between lineages that have given rise to new genotypes that have subsequently been retained within the global population.

In the present study, an RNA agonist of RIG-I was synthesized in vitro and shown to stimulate RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses at concentrations in the picomolar range. In human lung epithelial A549 cells, 5\u2032pppRNA specifically stimulated multiple parameters of the innate antiviral response, including IRF3, IRF7 and STAT1 activation, and induction of inflammatory and interferon stimulated genes - hallmarks of a fully functional antiviral response. Evaluation of the magnitude and duration of gene expression by transcriptional profiling identified a robust, sustained and diversified antiviral and inflammatory response characterized by enhanced pathogen recognition and interferon (IFN) signaling. Bioinformatics analysis further identified a transcriptional signature uniquely induced by 5\u2032pppRNA, and not by IFN\u03B1-2b, that included a constellation of IRF7 and NF-kB target genes capable of mobilizing multiple arms of the innate and adaptive immune response. Treatment of primary PBMCs or lung epithelial A549 cells with 5\u2032pppRNA provided significant protection against a spectrum of RNA and DNA viruses. In C57Bl/6 mice, intravenous administration of 5\u2032pppRNA protected animals from a lethal challenge with H1N1 Influenza, reduced virus titers in mouse lungs and protected animals from virus-induced pneumonia. Strikingly, the RIG-I-specific transcriptional response afforded partial protection from influenza challenge, even in the absence of type I interferon signaling. This systems approach provides transcriptional, biochemical, and in vivo analysis of the antiviral efficacy of 5\u2032pppRNA and highlights the therapeutic potential associated with the use of RIG-I agonists as broad spectrum antiviral agents.","publish_time":"2013-04-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goulet, Marie-Line; Olagnier, David; Xu, Zhengyun; Paz, Suzanne; Belgnaoui, S.

In an alternate model, baicalein was administered to male Balb/c mice which were given either IL-4 or IL-13 intranasally. Features of asthma were determined by estimating airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), histopathological changes and biochemical assays of key inflammatory molecules. Airway injury was determined with apoptotic assays, transmission electron microscopy and assessing key mitochondrial functions. Baicalein treatment reduced AHR and inflammation in both experimental models. TGF-\u03B2(1), sub-epithelial fibrosis and goblet cell metaplasia, were also reduced. Furthermore, baicalein treatment significantly reduced 12/15-LOX activity, features of mitochondrial dysfunctions, and apoptosis of bronchial epithelia.

Its zoonotic nature and wide-spread distribution in industrialized countries calls for a quick and reliable diagnostic tool. Antibody-based detection presents a suitable means to identify pathogenic bacteria. However, the knowledge about immunodominant targets is limited. Thus, an approach is presented, which allows for the rapid screening of numerous cDNA derived expression clones to identify novel antigens. The deeper understanding of immunodominant proteins assists in the design of diagnostic tools and furthers the insight into the bacterium\u2019s pathogenicity as well as revealing potential candidates for vaccination. We have successfully screened 1536 clones of an expression library to identify 22 proteins that have not been described as immunodominant before. After subcloning the corresponding 22 genes and expression of full-length proteins, we investigated the immunodominant character by microarrays and ELISA. Subsequently, seven proteins were selected for epitope mapping. For cj0669 and cj0920c linear epitopes were identified. For cj0669, specificity assays revealed a specific linear epitope site. Consequently, an eleven amino acid residue sequence TLIKELKRLGI was analyzed via alanine scan, which revealed the glycine residue to be significant for binding of the antibody. The innovative approach presented herein of generating cDNAs of prokaryotes in combination with a microarray platform rendering time-consuming purification steps obsolete has helped to illuminate novel immunodominant proteins of C.jejuni. The findings of a specific linear epitope pave the way for a plethora of future research and the potential use in diagnostic applications such as serological screenings. Moreover, the current approach is easily adaptable to other highly relevant bacteria making it a formidable tool for the future discovery of antigens and potential biomarkers. Consequently, it is desirable to simplify the identification of structural epitopes, as this would extend the spectrum of novel epitopes to be detected.","publish_time":"2013-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hoppe, Sebastian; Bier, Frank F.; Nickisch-Rosenegk, Markus v.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8deca5b29c3d3c0b11f1c9032a981f95dc8d1619.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3667084.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3667084/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzgyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TLIKELKRLGI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["novel immunodominant proteins of C","expression of full-length proteins","immunodominant character","deeper understanding of immunodominant proteins","immunodominant targets","novel antigens","cj0920c linear epitopes","spectrum of novel epitopes","specific linear epitope site","potential use","expression library","diagnostic applications","potential biomarkers","reliable diagnostic tool","potential candidates","epitope mapping","cj0669","innovative approach","current approach","future discovery of antigens","design of diagnostic tools","identification of structural epitopes","glycine residue","formidable tool","relevant bacteria","pathogenic bacteria","Campylobacter jejuni","rapid screening of numerous cDNA derived expression clones","plethora of future research","Antibody-based detection","amino acid residue sequence TLIKELKRLGI","microarray platform","time-consuming purification steps obsolete","way","suitable means","specificity assays","distribution","combination","alanine scan","genes","industrialized countries","major gut pathogens","cDNAs of prokaryotes","insight","binding","bacterium\u2019s pathogenicity","serological screenings","zoonotic nature","subcloning","microarrays","ELISA","findings","vaccination","knowledge"],"language":"en"},

A dynamic model incorporating social distancing can provide a mechanism to consider complex scenarios to support decisions regarding antiviral stockpile size while considering uncertainty around behavioural interventions. We have examined the impact of social distancing measures on the demand for limited healthcare resources such as antiviral drugs from a central stockpile during a severe pandemic. METHODS: We used an existing age-structured model for pandemic influenza in Canada and biologically plausible scenarios for severe influenza transmission within the population. We incorporated data from published reports regarding stated intentions to change behaviour during a pandemic as well as the magnitude and duration of time that individuals expected to maintain the behavioural change. We ran simulations for all combinations of parameter values to identify the projected antiviral requirements in each scenario. RESULTS: With 12 weeks of distancing, the effect is relatively small for the lowest R0 of 1.6 with a projected stockpile to treat 25.6% being required (IQR = 21.7 \u2013 28.7%) unless the proportion of people involved (81%) and magnitude of the behaviour change is large (69% reduction in contacts). If 24 weeks of distancing occurs, with only a low to moderate reduction in contacts (38% or less), it is not possible to bring treatment requirements below 20% regardless of what proportion of the population engages in distancing measures when transmissibility is high (R0 = 2.0; stockpile size = 31%, IQR = 29.2 \u2013 33.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the magnitude and duration of social distancing behaviours during a severe pandemic have an impact on the need for antiviral drugs. However, significant investments over a long period of time (\u003E16 weeks) are required to decrease the need for antiviral treatment to below 10% of the total population for a highly transmissible viral strain (R0 \u003E 1.8). Encouraging individuals to adopt behaviours that decrease their daily contact rate can help to control the spread of the virus until a vaccine becomes available however; relying on these measures to justify stockpiling fewer courses of treatment will not be sufficient in the case of a severe pandemic.","publish_time":"2013-07-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Greer, Amy L","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0c945e8af07a857b9ca130cf85c36b8e170561b3.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3723680.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3723680/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg3NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Canada"],"keyphrases":["severe pandemic","weeks of distancing","pandemic influenza","antiviral treatment","antiviral stockpile size","antiviral drugs","impact of social distancing measures","duration of social distancing behaviours","projected stockpile","projected antiviral requirements","magnitude","individuals","behaviour change","central stockpile","treatment requirements","behavioural change","severe influenza transmission","lowest R0","duration of time","total population","case","need","contacts","RESULTS","IQR","plausible scenarios","complex scenarios","dynamic model","stockpiling fewer courses of treatment","moderate reduction","behavioural interventions","proportion of people","long period of time","existing age-structured model","Canada","limited healthcare resources","demand","stated intentions","uncertainty","decisions","transmissibility","combinations of parameter values","transmissible viral strain","published reports","data","effect","mechanism","significant investments","daily contact rate","virus","vaccine","spread","simulations","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

For control measures to be more effective, a measure of the heterogeneity of the parameters is desirable. METHODS: We propose a novel extension of a network-based approach to estimating the reproductive number. With this we can incorporate spatial and/or demographic information through a similarity matrix. We apply this to the 2009 Influenza pandemic in South Africa to understand the spatial variability across provinces. We explore the use of five similarity matrices to illustrate their impact on the subsequent epidemic parameter estimates. RESULTS: When treating South Africa as a single entity with homogeneous transmission characteristics across the country, the basic reproductive number, R(0), (and imputation range) is 1.33 (1.31, 1.36). When fitting a new model for each province with no inter-province connections this estimate varies little (1.23-1.37). Using the proposed method with any of the four similarity measures yields an overall R(0) that varies little across the four new models (1.33 to 1.34). However, when allowed to vary across provinces, the estimated R(0) is greater than one consistently in only two of the nine provinces, the most densely populated provinces of Gauteng and Western Cape. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of influenza transmission was compelling in South Africa during the 2009 pandemic. This variability makes a qualitative difference in our understanding of the epidemic. While the cause of this fluctuation might be partially due to reporting differences, there is substantial evidence to warrant further investigation.","publish_time":"2013-07-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"White, Laura F; Archer, Brett; Pagano, Marcello","journal":"Int J Health Geogr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/09561ed721369a7a9e077f7bea9022499c12b13d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3735474.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735474/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg4MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["South Africa","Gauteng"],"keyphrases":["South Africa","disease transmission","spatial heterogeneity of influenza transmission","spatial variability","similarity measures","Estimates of parameters","Influenza pandemic","populated provinces of Gauteng","similarity matrices","similarity matrix","estimated R","overall R","RESULTS","homogeneous transmission characteristics","basic reproductive number","subsequent epidemic parameter estimates","control measures","new models","inter-province connections","large-scale infectious disease outbreaks","impact","country","single entity","network-based approach","novel extension","average","substantial evidence","Western Cape","demographic information","reporting differences","qualitative difference","large groups of people","understanding","BACKGROUND","fluctuation","diverse area","investigation","METHODS","proposed method","imputation range","cause","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

Current molecular influenza virus tests were designed for use in diagnostic testing facilities, where sophisticated equipment and highly trained technicians are available. A longer turnaround time for the centralized testing than when testing near the sample source could delay the initiation of medical intervention, thereby reducing the efficacy of antiviral treatment. The new assay, the SAMBA (simple amplification-based assay) Flu duplex test, is a dipstick-based molecular assay developed to provide a simple, accurate, and cost-effective solution for the diagnosis of influenza A/B viruses intended for near-patient testing. The test presents an alternative format of influenza virus molecular testing that utilizes isothermal amplification and visual detection of nucleic acid on a test strip. The entire test procedure (extraction, amplification, and detection) is integrated into an enclosed semiautomated system. Analytically, the SAMBA Flu duplex test detects 95 and 85 copies of viral genomes for influenza A and B viruses, respectively, with no cross-reactivity observed against other common respiratory pathogens. The clinical performance was established by blind testing of 328 nasal/throat and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the United Kingdom and Belgium and comparing the results with the quantitative reverse transcription-PCR method routinely used in two public health laboratories. The SAMBA Flu duplex test showed a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 97.9% for influenza virus A and 100% and 100% for influenza virus B. The test provides a new technology that could facilitate simple and timely identification of influenza virus infection, potentially resulting in more efficient control measures.","publish_time":"2013-09-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Liang-Ta; Thomas, Isabelle; Curran, Martin D.; Ellis, Joanna S.; Parmar, Surendra; Goel, Neha; Sharma, Pia I.; Allain, Jean-Pierre; Lee, Helen H.","journal":"J Clin Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d604b2fa9328520de1cb77b550803b82b6bbbe87.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3754654.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3754654/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozg5NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["B.

The purposes of this study were to detect respiratory viruses in hospitalized children younger than six years and identify the influence of temperature and relative air humidity on the detected viruses. Samples of nasopharyngeal washes were collected from hospitalized children between May/2004 and September/2005. Methods of viral detection were RT-PCR, PCR and HRV amplicons were confirmed by hybridization. Results showed 54% (148/272) of viral positivity. HRSV was detected in 29% (79/272) of the samples; HRV in 23.1% (63/272); HPIV3 in 5.1% (14/272); HMPV in 3.3% (9/272); HPIV1 in 2.9% (8/272); FLUB in 1.4% (4/272), FLUA in 1.1% (3/272), and HPIV2 in 0.3% (1/272).

There are currently no licensed vaccines for CHIKV and current anti-inflammatory drug treatment is often inadequate. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of two human monoclonal antibodies, C9 and E8, from CHIKV infected and recovered individuals. C9 was determined to be a potent virus neutralizing antibody and a biosensor antibody binding study demonstrated it recognized residues on intact CHIKV VLPs. Shotgun mutagenesis alanine scanning of 98 percent of the residues in the E1 and E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV envelope showed that the epitope bound by C9 included amino-acid 162 in the acid-sensitive region (ASR) of the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein. The ASR is critical for the rearrangement of CHIKV E2 during fusion and viral entry into host cells, and we predict that C9 prevents these events from occurring. When used prophylactically in a CHIKV mouse model, C9 completely protected against CHIKV viremia and arthritis. We also observed that when administered therapeutically at 8 or 18 hours post-CHIKV challenge, C9 gave 100% protection in a pathogenic mouse model. Given that targeting this novel neutralizing epitope in E2 can potently protect both in vitro and in vivo, it is likely to be an important region both for future antibody and vaccine-based interventions against CHIKV.","publish_time":"2013-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Selvarajah, Suganya; Sexton, Nicole R.; Kahle, Kristen M.; Fong, Rachel H.; Mattia, Kimberly-Anne; Gardner, Joy; Lu, Kai; Liss, Nathan M.; Salvador, Beatriz; Tucker, David F.; Barnes, Trevor; Mabila, Manu; Zhou, Xiangdong; Rossini, Giada; Rucker, Joseph B.; Sanders, David Avram; Suhrbier, Andreas; Sambri, Vittorio; Michault, Alain; Muench, Marcus O.; Doranz, Benjamin J.; Simmons, Graham","journal":"PLoS Negl Trop Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6c9d5c49fd907d0380d25e4df6cac63b00bce66b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3772074.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3772074/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzkxNw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CHIKV","ASR"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CHIKV infected","CHIKV viremia","C9","rearrangement of CHIKV E2","CHIKV E2 glycoprotein","CHIKV mouse model","intact CHIKV VLPs","E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV envelope","hours post-CHIKV challenge","future antibody","residues","ASR","chikungunya virus","potent virus","acid-sensitive region","pathogenic mouse model","novel neutralizing epitope","biosensor antibody binding study","important region","amino-acid","current anti-inflammatory drug treatment","percent","viral entry","E8","E1","human monoclonal antibodies","vaccine-based interventions","protection","host cells","licensed vaccines","Shotgun mutagenesis alanine scanning","cases of acute","chronic rheumatic disease","characterization","alphavirus","isolation","largest epidemic","mosquito","arthritis","individuals","events"],"language":"en"},

The base excision repair pathway is one of the most important cellular protection mechanisms that responds to oxidative DNA damage. Lesion-specific DNA repair enzymes include hOgg1, hMYH, hNTH and hMTH. METHODS: The above lesion-specific DNA repair enzymes were expressed in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) using the pSF91.1 retroviral vector. Cells were exposed to a 95% oxygen environment, ionizing radiation (IR), or H(2)O(2). Cell growth analysis was performed under non-toxic conditions. Western blot analysis was performed to verify over-expression and assess endogenous expression under toxic and non-toxic conditions. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student\u0027s t test with significance being accepted for p \u003C 0.05. RESULTS: Cell killing assays demonstrated cells over-expressing hMYH had improved survival to both increased oxygen and IR. Cell growth analysis of A549 cells under non-toxic conditions revealed cells over-expressing hMYH also grow at a slower rate. Western blot analysis demonstrated over-expression of each individual gene and did not result in altered endogenous expression of the others. However, it was observed that O(2 )toxicity did lead to a reduced endogenous expression of hNTH in A549 cells. CONCLUSION: Increased expression of the DNA glycosylase repair enzyme hMYH in A549 cells exposed to O(2 )and IR leads to improvements in cell survival. DNA repair through the base excision repair pathway may provide an alternative way to offset the damaging effects of O(2 )and its metabolites.","publish_time":"2004-09-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kremer, Ted M; Rinne, Mikael L; Xu, Yi; Chen, Xian Ming; Kelley, Mark R","journal":"Respir Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4df2c6eecb985fcb20da3c5ed46e3b910c7077ab.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC521691.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC521691/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzUx0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["over-expression","Cell growth analysis of A549 cells","cells over-expressing hMYH","Increased expression","DNA glycosylase repair enzyme hMYH","Lesion-specific DNA repair enzymes","non-toxic conditions","base excision repair pathway","reduced endogenous expression of hNTH","Statistical analysis","cell survival","Western blot analysis","human alveolar epithelial cells","increased oxygen","Oxygen toxicity","oxidative DNA damage","oxygen environment","damaging effects of O","hOgg1","assays","alternative way","significance","paired Student\u0027s t test","important cellular protection mechanisms","major cause of lung injury","ionizing radiation","pSF91","individual gene","BACKGROUND","hMTH","improvements","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","slower rate","retroviral vector","METHODS","metabolites"],"language":"en"},

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Nine hundred forty-nine samples of nasopharyngeal secretions from children under 3 y of age with LRTIs were analysed by a quantitative HCoV-NL63-specific real-time PCR. The samples had been collected from hospitalised patients and outpatients from December 1999 to October 2001 in four different regions in Germany as part of the prospective population-based PRI.DE study and analysed for RNA from respiratory viruses. Forty-nine samples (5.2%), mainly derived from the winter season, were positive for HCoV-NL63 RNA. The viral RNA was more prevalent in samples from outpatients (7.9%) than from hospitalised patients (3.2%, p = 0.003), and co-infection with either respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus 3 was observed frequently. Samples in which only HCoV-NL63 RNA could be detected had a significantly higher viral load than samples containing additional respiratory viruses (median 2.1 \u00D7 10(6) versus 2.7 \u00D7 10(2) copies/ml, p = 0.0006). A strong association with croup was apparent: 43% of the HCoV-NL63-positive patients with high HCoV-NL63 load and absence of co-infection suffered from croup, compared to 6% in the HCoV-NL63-negative group, p \u003C 0.0001. A significantly higher fraction (17.4%) of samples from croup patients than from non-croup patients (4.2%) contained HCoV-NL63 RNA.

These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations. CONCLUSION: Chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection.

RESULTS: The stability of six potential reference genes was examined in eight tissues of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), to determine the most suitable genes to be used in quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses. The relative transcription levels of genes encoding 18S rRNA, S20 ribosomal protein, \u03B2-actin, glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and two paralog genes encoding elongation factor 1A (EF1A(A )and EF1A(B)) were quantified in gills, liver, head kidney, spleen, thymus, brain, muscle, and posterior intestine in six untreated adult fish, in addition to a group of individuals that went through smoltification.

Critical to the succesful application of real-time PCR is careful assay design, reaction optimization and validation to maximize sensitivity and accuracy. In most of the studies published GAPD, ACTB or 18S rRNA have been used as a single reference gene without prior verification of their expression stability. Normalization of the data using unstable controls can result in erroneous conclusions, especially when only one reference gene is used. RESULTS: In this study the transcription levels of 8 commonly used reference genes (ACTB, GAPD, Histone H2A, TBP, HPRT1, SDHA, YWHAZ and 18S rRNA) were determined at different preimplantation stages (2-cell, 8-cell, blastocyst and hatched blastocyst) in order to select the most stable genes to normalize quantitative data within different preimplantation embryo stages. CONCLUSION: Using the geNorm application YWHAZ, GAPD and SDHA were found to be the most stable genes across the examined embryonic stages, while the commonly used ACTB was shown to be highly regulated. We recommend the use of the geometric mean of those 3 reference genes as an accurate normalization factor, which allows small expression differences to be reliably measured.","publish_time":"2005-12-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Goossens, Karen; Van Poucke, Mario; Van Soom, Ann; Vandesompele, Jo; Van Zeveren, Alex; Peelman, Luc J","journal":"BMC Dev Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2739ea989ec040104223cfb49d2a13d7d89dc79a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1315359.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1315359/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE3Mg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["used reference genes","used ACTB","GAPD","stable genes","different preimplantation stages","single reference gene","different preimplantation embryo stages","Real-time quantitative PCR","order","quantitative data","gene transcription patterns","SDHA","preimplantation embryos","cell","S rRNA","succesful application of real-time PCR","geNorm application YWHAZ","examined embryonic stages","embryo development","transcription levels","hatched blastocyst","expression stability","accurate normalization factor","small expression differences","careful assay design","reaction optimization","validation","TBP","prior verification","Histone H2A","efficient technique","unstable controls","HPRT1","sensitivity","information","geometric mean","assisted reproductive technologies","erroneous conclusions","study","BACKGROUND","accuracy","RESULTS","studies"],"language":"en"},

The aim of the present study was to investigate if this correlation could also be found in SPF pigs in which PMWS was experimentally reproduced and in naturally PMWS-affected pigs. RESULTS: When looking at the total anti-PCV2 antibody titres, PMWS-affected and healthy animals seroconverted at the same time point, and titres in PMWS-affected animals were only slightly lower compared to those in healthy animals. In healthy animals, the evolution of PCV2-neutralizing antibodies coincided with that of total antibodies. In PMWS-affected animals, neutralizing antibodies could either not be found (sera from field studies) or were detected in low titres between 7 and 14 DPI only (sera from experimentally inoculated SPF pigs). Differences were also found in the evolution of specific antibody isotypes titres against PCV2. In healthy pigs, IgM antibodies persisted until the end of the study, whereas in PMWS-affected pigs they quickly decreased or remained present at low titres. The mean titres of other antibody isotypes (IgG1, IgG2 and IgA), were slightly lower in PMWS-affected pigs compared to their healthy group mates at the end of each study. CONCLUSION: This study describes important differences in the development of the humoral immune response between pigs that get subclinically infected with PCV2 and pigs that experience a high level of PCV2-replication which in 3 of 4 experiments led to the development of PMWS. These observations may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of a PCV2-infection.","publish_time":"2006-01-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Meerts, Peter; Misinzo, Gerald; Lefebvre, David; Nielsen, Jens; B\u00F8tner, Anette; Kristensen, Charlotte S; Nauwynck, Hans J","journal":"BMC Vet Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/66a1d5898c1fb5c8e8554f92e446d262abb10fdb.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1386657.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1386657/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzE4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PMWS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["healthy pigs","evolution of PCV2","development of PMWS","healthy animals","absence of PCV2","PCV2-infection","total anti-PCV2 antibody titres","low titres","high level of PCV2","inoculated SPF pigs","mean titres","total antibodies","present study","IgM antibodies","previous study","evolution of specific antibody isotypes titres","healthy group mates","end","sera","high replication of Porcine circovirus","important differences","humoral immune response","IgG1","time point","IgA","pathogenesis","IgG2","better understanding","gnotobiotic pig","CONCLUSION","experiments","field studies","observations","BACKGROUND","aim","correlation","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

One of the critical steps in comparing transcription profiles is accurate normalisation. In most of the studies published on real-time PCR in horses, normalisation occurred against only one reference gene, usually GAPDH or ACTB, without validation of its expression stability. This might result in unreliable conclusions, because it has been demonstrated that the expression levels of so called \u0022housekeeping genes\u0022 may vary considerably in different tissues, cell types or disease stages, particularly in clinical samples associated with malignant disease. The goal of this study was to establish a reliable set of reference genes for studies concerning normal equine skin and equine sarcoids, which are the most common skin tumour in horses. RESULTS: In the present study the gene transcription levels of 6 commonly used reference genes (ACTB, B2M, HPRT1, UBB, TUBA1 and RPL32) were determined in normal equine skin and in equine sarcoids. After applying the geNorm applet to this set of genes, TUBA1, ACTB and UBB were found to be most stable in normal skin and B2M, ACTB and UBB in equine sarcoids. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, TUBA1, ACTB and UBB, respectively B2M, ACTB and UBB can be proposed as reference gene panels for accurate normalisation of quantitative data for normal equine skin, respectively equine sarcoids. When normal skin and equine sarcoids are compared, the use of the geometric mean of UBB, ACTB and B2M can be recommended as a reliable and accurate normalisation factor.","publish_time":"2006-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bogaert, Lies; Van Poucke, Mario; De Baere, Cindy; Peelman, Luc; Gasthuys, Frank; Martens, Ann","journal":"BMC Biotechnol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/8c640872048570b0a671ec08c83ef6cbebcdd78e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1484482.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1484482/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIyMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ACTB","equine sarcoids","normal equine skin","normal skin","B2M","gene transcription levels","reference gene panels","used reference genes","set of genes","reliable set of reference genes","accurate normalisation factor","TUBA1","accurate normalisation of quantitative data","gene transcription patterns","geometric mean of UBB","common skin tumour","housekeeping genes","accurate technique","transcription profiles","studies","Real-time quantitative PCR","real-time PCR","expression levels","horses","RESULTS","disease stages","different tissues","malignant disease","present study","expression stability","different biological conditions","HPRT1","clinical samples","cell types","RPL32","validation","GAPDH","critical steps","BACKGROUND","geNorm applet","unreliable conclusions","goal"],"language":"en"},

With globalization booming, it is important to understand international patterns of resistance. If countries already experience similar patterns of resistance, it may be too late to worry about international spread. If large countries or groups of countries that are likely to leap ahead in their integration with the rest of the world \u2013 China being the standout case \u2013 have high and distinctive patterns of resistance, then a coordinated response could substantially help to control the spread of resistance. The literature to date provides only limited evidence on these issues. METHODS: We study the recent patterns of antibiotic resistance in three geographically separated, and culturally and economically distinct countries \u2013 China, Kuwait and the United States \u2013 to gauge the range and depth of this global health threat, and its potential for growth as globalization expands. Our primary measures are the prevalence of resistance of specific bacteria to specific antibiotics. We also propose and illustrate methods for aggregating specific \u0022bug-drug\u0022 data. We use these aggregate measures to summarize the resistance pattern for each country and to study the extent of correlation between countries\u0027 patterns of drug resistance. RESULTS: We find that China has the highest level of antibiotic resistance, followed by Kuwait and the U.S. In a study of resistance patterns of several most common bacteria in China in 1999 and 2001, the mean prevalence of resistance among hospital-acquired infections was as high as 41% (with a range from 23% to 77%) and that among community- acquired infections was 26% (with a range from 15% to 39%). China also has the most rapid growth rate of resistance (22% average growth in a study spanning 1994 to 2000). Kuwait is second (17% average growth in a period from 1999 to 2003), and the U.S. the lowest (6% from 1999 to 2002). Patterns of resistance across the three countries are not highly correlated; the most correlated were China and Kuwait, followed by Kuwait and the U.S., and the least correlated pair was China and the U.S. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance is a serious and growing problem in all three countries. To date, there is not strong international convergence in the countries\u0027 resistance patterns. This finding may change with the greater international travel that will accompany globalization. Future research on the determinants of drug resistance patterns, and their international convergence or divergence, should be a priority.","publish_time":"2006-04-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Ruifang; Eggleston, Karen; Rotimi, Vincent; Zeckhauser, Richard J","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a0f13b751004e29186fa070fdffa2e876815e41a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1502134.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1502134/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIyOA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["China","United States","U.S.","Kuwait"],"keyphrases":["international patterns of resistance","study of resistance patterns","Antimicrobial resistance","spread of resistance","countries\u0027 resistance patterns","distinctive patterns of resistance","similar patterns of resistance","countries\u0027 patterns of drug resistance","determinants of drug resistance patterns","recent patterns of antibiotic resistance","China","mean prevalence of resistance","rapid growth rate of resistance","highest level of antibiotic resistance","Kuwait","international spread","groups of countries","large countries","distinct countries","average growth","globalization","range","strong international convergence","specific bacteria","greater international travel","bug-drug","specific antibiotics","correlated pair","date","METHODS","infections","global health threat","public health","common bacteria","aggregate measures","primary measures","under-appreciated threat","standout case","nations","world","potential","hospital","CONCLUSION","growing problem","extent of correlation","limited evidence","depth","United States","Future research","integration","literature","globe","rest","country","data","divergence","BACKGROUND","coordinated response","issues","finding","period","priority","community","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Approaches with high throughput and high sensitivity for assaying low-expression transcripts are urgently needed for functional genomic studies. Combination of the suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and cDNA microarray techniques using the subtracted cDNA clones as probes printed on chips has greatly improved the efficiency for fishing out the differentially expressed clones and has been used before. However, it remains tedious and inefficient sequencing works for identifying genes including the great number of redundancy in the subtracted amplicons, and sacrifices the original advantages of high sensitivity of SSH in profiling low-expression transcriptomes. RESULTS: We modified the previous combination of SSH and microarray methods by directly using the subtracted amplicons as targets to hybridize the pre-made cDNA microarrays (named as \u0022SSH/microarray\u0022). mRNA prepared from three pairs of hepatoma and non-hepatoma liver tissues was subjected to the SSH/microarray assays, as well as directly to regular cDNA microarray assays for comparison. As compared to the original SSH and microarray combination assays, the modified SSH/microarray assays allowed for much easier inspection of the subtraction efficiency and identification of genes in the subtracted amplicons without tedious and inefficient sequencing work. On the other hand, 5015 of the 9376 genes originally filtered out by the regular cDNA microarray assays because of low expression became analyzable by the SSH/microarray assays. Moreover, the SSH/microarray assays detected about ten times more (701 vs. 69) HCC differentially expressed genes (at least a two-fold difference and P \u003C 0.01), particularly for those with rare transcripts, than did the regular cDNA microarray assays. The differential expression was validated in 9 randomly selected genes in 18 pairs of hepatoma/non-hepatoma liver tissues using quantitative RT-PCR. The SSH/microarray approaches resulted in identifying many differentially expressed genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle, cell death, signal transduction and cell morphogenesis, suggesting the involvement of multi-biological processes in hepato-carcinogenesis. CONCLUSION: The modified SSH/microarray approach is a simple but high-sensitive and high-efficient tool for differentially profiling the low-expression transcriptomes. It is most adequate for applying to functional genomic studies.","publish_time":"2006-05-31T00:00:00Z","authors":"Pan, Yi-Shin; Lee, Yun-Shien; Lee, Yung-Lin; Lee, Wei-Chen; Hsieh, Sen-Yung","journal":"BMC Genomics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/4db3931c4b24ae432d68b7e24f593b1272445523.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1522022.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1522022/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzIzMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SSH","HCC"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["microarray combination assays","regular cDNA microarray assays","microarray approaches","microarray methods","modified SSH","expression genes","cDNA microarray techniques","original SSH","low expression","previous combination of SSH","low-expression transcripts","profiling low-expression transcriptomes","original advantages of high sensitivity of SSH","subtracted cDNA clones","differential expression","identification of genes","selected genes","subtracted amplicons","cDNA microarrays","pairs of hepatoma","high-sensitive","assay of low","high throughput","genome-wide gene-expression profiling","non-hepatoma liver tissues","high-efficient tool","cell death","cell morphogenesis","functional genomic studies","regulation of cell cycle","inefficient sequencing work","subtraction efficiency","rare transcripts","signal transduction","involvement of multi-biological processes","easier inspection","quantitative RT-PCR","suppressive subtractive hybridization","hepato-carcinogenesis","main limitation","great number of redundancy","chips","probes","targets","comparison","CONCLUSION","fold difference","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","mRNA","times","hand","HCC"],"language":"en"},

Two authors reviewed selected papers for smallpox outbreaks. RESULTS: 51 relevant outbreaks were identified from 1,389 publications. The median for the effective first generation reproduction rate (initial R) was 2 (range 0\u201338). The majority outbreaks were small (less than 5 cases) and contained within one generation. Outbreaks with few hospitalized patients had low initial R values (median of 1) and were prolonged if not initially recognized (median of 3 generations); outbreaks with mostly hospitalized patients had higher initial R values (median 12) and were shorter (median of 3 generations). Index cases with an atypical presentation of smallpox were less likely to have been diagnosed with smallpox; outbreaks in which the index case was not correctly diagnosed were larger (median of 27.5 cases) and longer (median of 3 generations) compared to outbreaks in which the index case was correctly diagnosed (median of 3 cases and 1 generation).

The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients. We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria. In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria. Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture. In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm. Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive. In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak. Some may have been harmful. Clinical trials should be designed to validate a standard protocol for dosage and timing, and to accrue data in real time during future outbreaks to monitor specific adverse effects and help inform treatment.","publish_time":"2006-09-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stockman, Lauren J; Bellamy, Richard; Garner, Paul","journal":"PLoS Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/5dc0b8b662824323881c3a1ae3a1bae2a821484d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1564166.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1564166/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","SARS","IFN"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS treatment studies","SARS treatments","SARS patients","SARS outbreak","inhibition of SARS","SARS-infected patients","SARS convalescent plasma","studies of convalescent plasma","future treatment","studies of steroid use","SARS-infected patient reports","acute respiratory distress syndrome studies","ribavirin","IFN type","clinical trial evidence of treatment","effectiveness of treatment options","showed possible harm","published literature","IVIG","systematic review","lopinavir","Sources of data","research","LPV","Clinical trials","literature databases MEDLINE","extensive literature reporting","comprehensive summary of treatments","future outbreaks","inclusion criteria","predefined criteria","Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials","BIOSIS","specific adverse effects","corticosteroids","expert panel","EMBASE","presented clinicians","CoV","ritonavir","order","real time","intravenous immunoglobulin","life-threatening disease","timing","help","interferon","World Health Organization","tissue culture","standard protocol","dosage","CONCLUSIONS","priorities","publications","total","METHODS","FINDINGS","response","experience","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

The Health Sector Assessment (HSA) concluded that climate variability and change are likely to increase morbidity and mortality risks for several climate-sensitive health outcomes, with the net impact uncertain. The objective of this study was to update the first HSA based on recent publications that address the potential impacts of climate variability and change in the United States for the five health outcome categories. The literature published since the first HSA supports the initial conclusions, with new data refining quantitative exposure\u2013response relationships for several health end points, particularly for extreme heat events and air pollution. The United States continues to have a very high capacity to plan for and respond to climate change, although relatively little progress has been noted in the literature on implementing adaptive strategies and measures. Large knowledge gaps remain, resulting in a substantial need for additional research to improve our understanding of how weather and climate, both directly and indirectly, can influence human health. Filling these knowledge gaps will help better define the potential health impacts of climate change and identify specific public health adaptations to increase resilience.","publish_time":"2006-05-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ebi, Kristie L.; Mills, David M.; Smith, Joel B.; Grambsch, Anne","journal":"Environ Health Perspect","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c6183dfbaabc06881c70097745b3e646479ac9a7.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1570072.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1570072/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI4MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["U.S. National Assessment","HSA"],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["potential health impacts of climate change","human health","climate-sensitive health outcomes","anticipated health impacts of climate variability","categories of health outcomes","Health Sector Assessment","health outcome categories","health sector component","health end points","potential impacts of climate variability","specific public health adaptations","HSA","extreme weather events","air pollution","United States","diseases","literature","extreme heat events","Large knowledge gaps","National Assessment","response relationships","new data","quantitative exposure","storms","temperature","mortality risks","food","water","floods","morbidity","initial conclusions","additional research","vector","net impact uncertain","resilience","understanding","recent publications","substantial need","little progress","adaptive strategies","measures","rodent","study","high capacity","objective"],"language":"en"},

Prior to 2003, data relating to inter-facility patient transfers were not collected in a systematic manner. Then, in an emergency setting, a comprehensive database with a complex data collection process was established. For the first time in Ontario, population-based data for patient movement between healthcare facilities for a population of twelve million are available. The PTAC database stores all patient transfer data in a large database. There are few population-based patient transfer databases and the PTAC database is believed to be the largest example to house this novel dataset. A patient transfer database has also never been validated. This paper presents the validation of the PTAC database. METHODS: A random sample of 100 patient inter-facility transfer records was compared to the corresponding institutional patient records from the sending healthcare facilities. Measures of agreement, including sensitivity, were calculated for the 12 common data variables. RESULTS: Of the 100 randomly selected patient transfer records, 95 (95%) of the corresponding institutional patient records were located. Data variables in the categories patient demographics, facility identification and timing of transfer and reason and urgency of transfer had strong agreement levels. The 10 most commonly used data variables had accuracy rates that ranged from 85.3% to 100% and error rates ranging from 0 to 12.6%. These same variables had sensitivity values ranging from 0.87 to 1.0. CONCLUSION: The very high level of agreement between institutional patient records and the PTAC data for fields compared in this study supports the validity of the PTAC database. For the first time, a population-based patient transfer database has been established. Although it was created during an emergency situation and data collection is dependent on front-line medical workers, the PTAC data has achieved a high level of validity, perhaps even higher than many purpose built databases created during non-emergency settings.","publish_time":"2006-10-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Robinson, Victoria A; MacDonald, Russell D; Manuel, Doug; Goel, Vivek","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3e572863713d0fbe8cf60ea9991dd5c9993e6c7d.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1609112.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1609112/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzI4OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["The Provincial Transfer Authorization Centre","PTAC"],"locations":["Ontario","Canada"],"keyphrases":["PTAC database","selected patient transfer records","patient movement","patient inter-facility transfer records","population-based patient transfer databases","population-based data","corresponding institutional patient records","facility patient transfers","urgency of transfer","timing of transfer","used data variables","common data variables","categories patient demographics","comprehensive database","large database","complex data collection process","Provincial Transfer Authorization Centre","emergency situation","emergency response","high level of agreement","facility identification","Ontario","high level of validity","non-emergency settings","Measures of agreement","time","sending healthcare facilities","strong agreement levels","accuracy rates","error rates","sensitivity values","Canada","front-line medical workers","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","reason","random sample","SARS","outbreak","BACKGROUND","purpose","study","fields","largest example","novel dataset","validation","METHODS","CONCLUSION","paper","systematic manner","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

It has also become a promising method for epitope mapping. Research on new algorithms that assist and automate phage display based epitope mapping has attracted many groups. Most of the existing tools have not been implemented as an online service until now however, making it less convenient for the community to access, utilize, and evaluate them. RESULTS: We present MIMOX, a free web tool that helps to map the native epitope of an antibody based on one or more user supplied mimotopes and the antigen structure. MIMOX was coded in Perl using modules from the Bioperl project. It has two sections. In the first section, MIMOX provides a simple interface for ClustalW to align a set of mimotopes. It also provides a simple statistical method to derive the consensus sequence and embeds JalView as a Java applet to view and manage the alignment. In the second section, MIMOX can map a single mimotope or a consensus sequence of a set of mimotopes, on to the corresponding antigen structure and search for all of the clusters of residues that could represent the native epitope. NACCESS is used to evaluate the surface accessibility of the candidate clusters; and Jmol is embedded to view them interactively in their 3D context. Initial case studies show that MIMOX can reproduce mappings from existing tools such as FINDMAP and 3DEX, as well as providing novel, rational results. CONCLUSION: A web-based tool called MIMOX has been developed for phage display based epitope mapping. As a publicly available online service in this area, it is convenient for the community to access, utilize, and evaluate, complementing other existing programs.

All group 1b coronaviruses encode a single accessory protein between the spike and envelope genes, except for human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E. The prototype virus has a split gene, encoding the putative ORF4a and ORF4b proteins. To determine whether primary HCoV-229E isolates exhibit this unusual genome organization, we analyzed the ORF4a/b region of five current clinical isolates from The Netherlands and three early isolates collected at the Common Cold Unit (CCU) in Salisbury, UK. RESULTS: All Dutch isolates were identical in the ORF4a/b region at amino acid level. All CCU isolates are only 98% identical to the Dutch isolates at the nucleotide level, but more closely related to the prototype HCoV-229E (\u003E98%). Remarkably, our analyses revealed that the laboratory adapted, prototype HCoV-229E has a 2-nucleotide deletion in the ORF4a/b region, whereas all clinical isolates carry a single ORF, 660 nt in size, encoding a single protein of 219 amino acids, which is a homologue of the ORF3 proteins encoded by HCoV-NL63 and PEDV. CONCLUSION: Thus, the genome organization of the group 1b coronaviruses HCoV-NL63, PEDV and HCoV-229E is identical. It is possible that extensive culturing of the HCoV-229E laboratory strain resulted in truncation of ORF4. This may indicate that the protein is not essential in cell culture, but the highly conserved amino acid sequence of the ORF4 protein among clinical isolates suggests that the protein plays an important role in vivo.","publish_time":"2006-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dijkman, Ronald; Jebbink, Maarten F; Wilbrink, Berry; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Zaaijer, Hans L; Minor, Philip D; Franklin, Sally; Berkhout, Ben; Thiel, Volker; van der Hoek, Lia","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/979eb6ed6241fecc3000a963222725a6439b2e19.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1774570.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1774570/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzMzMA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CCU","UK","PEDV"],"locations":["The Netherlands"],"keyphrases":["E isolates","prototype HCoV","Dutch isolates","CCU isolates","b coronaviruses HCoV-NL63","early isolates","primary HCoV","b region","single protein","current clinical isolates","ORF4 protein","single accessory protein","genome of coronaviruses","E laboratory strain","putative ORF4a","amino acid level","envelope genes","non-structural genes","single ORF","so-called accessory genes","amino acids","unusual genome organization","group","PEDV","nucleotide level","prototype virus","conserved amino acid sequence","truncation of ORF4","nucleotide deletion","ORF3 proteins","ORF4b proteins","spike","Common Cold Unit","split gene","size","Netherlands","cell culture","human coronavirus","Salisbury","homologue","extensive culturing","RESULTS","UK","important role","CONCLUSION","BACKGROUND","analyses"],"language":"en"},

These include Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) that can cause disseminated or persistent localized infections. To define the precise structural features that determine the binding of distinct pathogens with CEACAMs, we have undertaken molecular modelling and mutation of the receptor molecules at previously implicated key target residues required for bacterial binding. These include Ser-32, Tyr-34, Val-39, Gln-44 and Gln-89, in addition to Ile-91, the primary docking site for the pathogens. Most, but not all, of these residues located adjacent to each other in a previous N-domain model of human CEACAM1, which was based on REI, CD2 and CD4. In the current studies, we have refined this model based on the mouse CEACAM1 crystal structure, and observe that all of the above residues form an exposed continuous binding region on the N-domain. Examination of the model also suggested that substitution of two of these residues 34 and 89 could affect the accessibility of Ile-91 for ligand binding. By introducing selected mutations at the positions 91, 34 and 89, we confirmed the primary importance of Ile-91 in all bacterial binding to CEACAM1 despite the inter- and intraspecies structural differences between the bacterial CEACAM-binding ligands. The studies further indicated that the efficiency of binding was significantly enhanced for specific strains by mutations such as Y34F and Q89N, which also altered the hierarchy of Nm versus Hi strain binding. These studies imply that distinct polymorphisms in human epithelial CEACAMs have the potential to decrease or increase the risk of infection by the receptor-targeting pathogens.","publish_time":"2007-02-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Villullas, Silvia; Hill, Darryl J; Sessions, Richard B; Rea, Jon; Virji, Mumtaz","journal":"Cell Microbiol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/6ea2532aacbdcea4609067523e9e72fa8cd73200.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1859983.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1859983/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzM4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Haemophilus"],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial binding","binding of distinct pathogens","ligand binding","efficiency of binding","bacterial CEACAM-binding ligands","previous N-domain model of human CEACAM1","exposed continuous binding region","human epithelial CEACAMs","important human respiratory pathogens","domain of human carcinoembryonic antigen","receptor molecules","accessibility of Ile","primary importance of Ile","Gln","current studies","implicated key target residues","N-terminal IgV","primary docking site","distinct polymorphisms","mouse CEACAM1 crystal structure","hierarchy of Nm","selected mutations","intraspecies structural differences","precise structural features","common overlapping site","related cell adhesion molecules","molecular modelling","Y34F","potential","specific strains","Neisseria meningitidis","Haemophilus influenzae","Q89N","REI","risk of infection","Tyr","persistent localized infections","CD2","CD4","Val","positions","addition","substitution","Examination"],"language":"en"},

One component of these activities has been the development and conduct of exercise programs to assess capabilities, train staff and build relationships. This paper summarizes lessons learned from tabletop exercises about public health emergency preparedness and about the process of developing, conducting, and evaluating them. METHODS: We developed, conducted, and evaluated 31 tabletop exercises in partnership with state and local health departments throughout the US from 2003 to 2006. Participant self evaluations, after action reports, and tabletop exercise evaluation forms were used to identify aspects of the exercises themselves, as well as public health emergency responses that participants found more or less challenging, and to highlight lessons learned about tabletop exercise design. RESULTS: Designing the exercises involved substantial collaboration with representatives from participating health departments to assure that the scenarios were credible, focused attention on local preparedness needs and priorities, and were logistically feasible to implement. During execution of the exercises, nearly all health departments struggled with a common set of challenges relating to disease surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, communications, command and control, and health care surge capacity. In contrast, performance strengths were more varied across participating sites, reflecting specific attributes of individual health departments or communities, experience with actual public health emergencies, or the emphasis of prior preparedness efforts. CONCLUSION: The design, conduct, and evaluation of the tabletop exercises described in this report benefited from collaborative planning that involved stakeholders from participating health departments and exercise developers and facilitators from outside the participating agencies. While these exercises identified both strengths and vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness, additional work is needed to develop reliable metrics to gauge exercise performance, inform follow-up action steps, and to develop re-evaluation exercise designs that assess the impact of post-exercise interventions.","publish_time":"2007-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Dausey, David J; Buehler, James W; Lurie, Nicole","journal":"BMC Public Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/418f1b85e589f3ac37ffc37075b6e558e510fa74.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1894789.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1894789/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQwNQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["United States"],"keyphrases":["participating health departments","local health departments","tabletop exercises","public health emergency preparedness","public health emergency responses","tabletop exercise design","actual public health emergencies","exercise performance","specific attributes of individual health departments","high-impact public health emergencies","exercise developers","tabletop exercise evaluation forms","health care surge capacity","local preparedness","conduct of exercise programs","re-evaluation exercise designs","impact of post-exercise interventions","participating sites","participating agencies","performance strengths","emphasis of prior preparedness efforts","lessons","action reports","follow-up action steps","communities","experience","control","disease surveillance","epidemiologic investigations","communications","command","capabilities","vulnerabilities","substantial collaboration","stakeholders","facilitators","representatives","partnership","focused attention","additional work","common set of challenges","United States","scenarios","participants","train staff","collaborative planning","reliable metrics","Participant self evaluations","priorities","development","relationships","activities","contrast","aspects","paper","process","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","component","BACKGROUND","execution","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

Standard Affymetrix probeset annotation is at gene level, i.e. a probeset is precisely linked to a gene, and probeset intensity is interpreted as gene expression. The increased knowledge that one gene may have multiple transcript variants clearly brings up the necessity of updating this gene-level annotation to a refined transcript-level. RESULTS: Through performing rigorous alignments of the Affymetrix probe sequences against a comprehensive pool of currently available transcript sequences, and further linking the probesets to the International Protein Index, we generated transcript-level or protein-level annotation tables for two popular Affymetrix expression arrays, Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array and Human Genome U133A Array. Application of our new annotations in re-examining existing expression data sets shows increased expression consistency among synonymous probesets and strengthened expression correlation between interacting proteins. CONCLUSION: By refining the standard Affymetrix annotation of microarray probesets from the gene level to the transcript level and protein level, one can achieve a more reliable interpretation of their experimental data, which may lead to discovery of more profound regulatory mechanism.","publish_time":"2007-06-11T00:00:00Z","authors":"Yu, Hui; Wang, Feng; Tu, Kang; Xie, Lu; Li, Yuan-Yuan; Li, Yi-Xue","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2bf62ecb50fd95973de0bf6c1285ac3475fc4cc8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1913542.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1913542/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Standard Affymetrix","Affymetrix"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["gene level","transcript level","gene-level annotation","gene expression","protein level","refined transcript-level","protein-level annotation tables","Standard Affymetrix probeset annotation","standard Affymetrix annotation of microarray","popular Affymetrix expression arrays","increased expression consistency","Affymetrix probe sequences","available transcript sequences","probeset intensity","strengthened expression correlation","multiple transcript variants","wide use of Affymetrix microarray","re-examining existing expression data sets","International Protein Index","Mouse Genome","experimental data","Human Genome U133A Array","increased knowledge","comprehensive pool","new annotations","broadened fields of biological research","rigorous alignments","discovery","interacting proteins","necessity","profound regulatory mechanism","Application","reliable interpretation","BACKGROUND","important issue","RESULTS","CONCLUSION"],"language":"en"},

We report here the rational design of an attenuated recombinant coronavirus vaccine based on a deletion in the coding sequence of the non-structural protein 1 (nsp1).

The effect of nsp1 on MHV replication in vitro and in vivo was analyzed using a recombinant MHV encoding a deletion in the nsp1-coding sequence. The recombinant MHV nsp1 mutant grew normally in tissue culture, but was severely attenuated in vivo. Replication and spread of the nsp1 mutant virus was restored almost to wild-type levels in type I interferon (IFN) receptor-deficient mice, indicating that nsp1 interferes efficiently with the type I IFN system. Importantly, replication of nsp1 mutant virus in professional antigen-presenting cells such as conventional dendritic cells and macrophages, and induction of type I IFN in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, was not impaired. Furthermore, even low doses of nsp1 mutant MHV elicited potent cytotoxic T cell responses and protected mice against homologous and heterologous virus challenge.

However, it has suffered in finding currency as a general tool for global resource mobilisation, and is at risk of being attached to almost anything promoting development. This overstretches and devalues the validity and usefulness of the concept. This paper first defines GPGs and describes the policy challenge that they pose. Second, it identifies two key areas, health R\u0026D and communicable disease control, in which the GPG concept is clearly relevant and considers the extent to which it has been applied. We point out that that, while there have been many new initiatives, it is not clear that additional resources from non-traditional sources have been forthcoming. Yet achieving this is, in effect, the entire purpose of applying the GPG concept in global health. Moreover, the proliferation of disease-specific programs associated with GPG reasoning has tended to promote vertical interventions at the expense of more general health sector strengthening. Third, we examine two major global health policy initiatives, the Global Fund against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) and the bundling of long-standing international health goals in the form of Millennium Development Goals (MDG), asking how the GPG perspective has contributed to defining objectives and strategies. We conclude that both initiatives are best interpreted in the context of traditional development assistance and, one-world rhetoric aside, have little to do with the challenge posed by GPGs for health. The paper concludes by considering how the GPG concept can be more effectively used to promote global health.","publish_time":"2007-09-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Smith, Richard D; MacKellar, Landis","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/859ce5fe8d78cc11563e30669e02272ad2470d03.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2034545.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2034545/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzQ1MA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["GPG","Global Fund"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["GPG concept","health R","major global health policy initiatives","general health sector","Global Fund","GPG reasoning","GPG perspective","global resource mobilisation","bundling of long-standing international health goals","development circles","form of Millennium Development Goals","new initiatives","policy challenge","GPGs","paper","context of traditional development assistance","general tool","proliferation of disease","communicable disease control","AIDS","non-traditional sources","GFATM","Malaria","Tuberculosis","specific programs","expense","MDG","additional resources","vertical interventions","key areas","entire purpose","increasing attention","objectives","currency","world rhetoric","effect","risk","validity","usefulness","strategies","extent"],"language":"en"},

In the present study, we investigated the etiologic agents responsible for acute lower respiratory infections from the period November 1986 to October 1992 in order to determine the seasonal pattern and different characteristics of age distribution of respiratory infectious agents, mainly virus infections. Methods: A total of 1521 patients with lower respiratory infections was hospitalized in Saiseikai Central Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. Nasopharyngeal secretions were obtained for virus isolation and paired sera in the acute and convalescent phases were obtained for serological examination. Results: Etiological agents were identified in 668 of 1521 patients (43.9%) by serological antibody responses, virus isolation and/or detection of virus antigen: 240 (15.8%) with respiratory syncytial (RS) virus; 62 (4.1%) with influenza virus type A; 26 (1.7%) with influenza virus type B; 86 (5.7%) with adenovirus; 81 (5.3%) with parainfluenza virus; 32 (2.1%) with measles virus; 20 (1.3%) with enteroviruses or Herpes virus other than respiratory viruses; 75 (4.9%) with Mycoplasma pneumoniae; 10 (0.7%) with pertussis; and 36 (2.4%) with mixed infections. In the remaining 853 patients (56.1%), etiologic agents were not identified. Respiratory syncytial (RS) virus was a main causative agent of respiratory infections in patients younger than 3 years of age. Influenza virus and M. pneumoniae were two main causative agents in patients with acute respiratory illness over 5 years of age. Parainfluenza virus type 3 was frequently observed in infants from 9 to 12 months of age. A distinct seasonal pattern of viral infections was consistently observed in each year during the study period; RS and influenza viruses were prevalent in winter, parainfluenza virus was prevalent in spring and M. pneumoniae was prevalent in summer and autumn. However, adenovirus infections were observed in all seasons. Serological responses were poor in patients younger than 1 year of age and they were mainly diagnosed by virus isolation or detection of virus antigen. Conclusions: Virological epidemiology provides useful information in daily clinical practice for the prediction of etiological agents based on patient age and the seasonal distribution of agents. We should examine virus isolation and the detection of virus antigen, along with serological examinations in patients with respiratory infections, especially in infants younger than 1 year of age because of poor serological responses.","publish_time":"2002-05-02T00:00:00Z","authors":"Sonoda, SATOMI; Gotoh, YOSHINARI; Bann, FUMIHIKO; Nakayama, TETSUO","journal":"Pediatr Int","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/24e719025ece17de4575cfad85c4f67d8e89d0f1.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167942.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167942/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1MDU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["M. pneumoniae"],"organizations":[],"locations":["Tokyo","Japan"],"keyphrases":["virus isolation","Herpes virus","measles virus","detection of virus antigen","Parainfluenza virus type","respiratory viruses","Acute lower respiratory infections","influenza virus type B","adenovirus infections","acute respiratory illness","main causative agent of respiratory infections","patients younger","mixed infections","year of age","years of age","different characteristics of age distribution of respiratory infectious agents","seasonal distribution of agents","patient age","months of age","main causative agents","influenza viruses","etiologic agents responsible","prediction of etiological agents","poor serological responses","distinct seasonal pattern of viral infections","serological examinations","serological antibody responses","infants younger","study period","Mycoplasma pneumoniae","present study","useful information","daily clinical practice","major causes of hospitalization","Saiseikai Central Hospital","winter","Virological epidemiology","convalescent phases","paired sera","Abstract Background","spring","Conclusions","Tokyo","Japan","children","total","summer","autumn","Nasopharyngeal secretions","enteroviruses","order","Methods","Results","seasons","pertussis"],"language":"en"},

Existing in non\u2010identified animal reservoirs, SARS\u2010CoV continues to represent a threat to humans although more than four years have passed since a large outbreak of SARS, and no new cases have been reported. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of reemergence of SARS. It is hence necessary to understand the biology of the SARS\u2010CoV to deal adequately with the next outbreak, whenever it happens. The SARS\u2010CoV is a novel coronavirus with a large (\u223C30 thousand nucleotides) positive\u2010sense, single\u2010stranded RNA containing 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) of which 2 large ORFs constitute the replicase gene which encodes proteins required for viral RNA syntheses. The remaining 12 ORFs encode the 4 structural proteins: spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope; and eight accessory proteins. The viral genome and its expression within the host cell undergoes extensive translational and enzymatic processing to form the 4 structural, 8 accessory and 16 nonstructural proteins. In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms or capsid assembly and viral pathogenesis, laboratories around the world have adopted a variety of approaches to answering these trivial questions.

Furthermore, the recent research showed that there exists close relationship between small RNAs and human diseases. Several human diseases have surfaced in which miRNAs or their machinery might be implicated, such as some neurological diseases and cancers.

With the exception of three species of conifers, all natural polyploid species of gymnosperms belong to Ephedra, in which more than half of the species show polyploid cytotypes. Here, we investigated the origin and evolution of polyploids of Ephedra distributed in the Qinghai\u2013Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and neighbouring areas. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to measure the ploidy levels of the sampled species that are represented by multiple individuals from different populations, and then, two single\u2010copy nuclear genes (LFY and DDB2) and two chloroplast DNA fragments were used to unravel the possible origins and maternal donors of the polyploids. The results indicate that the studied polyploid species are allopolyploids, and suggest that allotetraploidy is a dominant mode of speciation in Ephedra. The high percentage of polyploids in the genus could be related to some of its biological attributes such as vegetative propagation, a relatively high rate of unreduced gamete formation, and a small genome size relative to most other gymnosperms. Significant ecological divergences between allotetraploids and their putative progenitors were detected by PCAs and anova and Tukey\u0027s tests, with the exception of E. saxatilis. The overlap of geographical distributions and ecological niches of some diploid species could have provided opportunities for interspecific hybridization and allopolyploid speciation.","publish_time":"2016-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wu, Hui; Ma, Zhen; Wang, Ming\u2010Ming; Qin, Ai\u2010Li; Ran, Jin\u2010Hua; Wang, Xiao\u2010Quan","journal":"Mol Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b6124240a207757a9ecb07f3b213a5822ea9708b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168403.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168403/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs1ODg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Ephedra"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["species of gymnosperms","diploid species","sampled species","species of conifers","Ephedra","exception of","evolution","ecological niches","allopolyploid speciation","high percentage","Significant ecological divergences","dominant mode of speciation","high rate of unreduced gamete formation","DDB2","opportunities","small genome size relative","QTP","LFY","PCAs","putative progenitors","Tibetan Plateau","vegetative propagation","allotetraploids","interspecific hybridization","multiple individuals","overlap of geographical distributions","anova","nuclear genes","Tukey\u0027s tests","allotetraploidy","Qinghai","chloroplast DNA fragments","possible origins","different populations","neighbouring areas","maternal donors","biological attributes","ploidy levels","half","Flow cytometry","FCM","genus","ferns","cytotypes","allopolyploids","angiosperms","saxatilis","results"],"language":"en"},

The main virulence determinant of most pathogenic proteobacteria is the type three secretion system (T3SS). The Xanthomonas genus includes bacteria responsible for numerous epidemics in agroecosystems worldwide and represents a major threat to plant health. The main virulence factor of Xanthomonas is the Hrp2 family T3SS; however, this system is not conserved in all strains and it has not been previously determined whether the distribution of T3SS in this bacterial genus has resulted from losses or independent acquisitions. Based on comparative genomics of 82 genome sequences representing the diversity of the genus, we have inferred three ancestral acquisitions of the Hrp2 cluster during Xanthomonas evolution followed by subsequent losses in some commensal strains and re\u2010acquisition in some species. While mutation was the main force driving polymorphism at the gene level, interspecies homologous recombination of large fragments expanding through several genes shaped Hrp2 cluster polymorphism. Horizontal gene transfer of the entire Hrp2 cluster also occurred. A reduced core effectome composed of xopF1, xopM, avrBs2 and xopR was identified that may allow commensal strains overcoming plant basal immunity. In contrast, stepwise accumulation of numerous type 3 effector genes was shown in successful pathogens responsible for epidemics. Our data suggest that capacity to intimately interact with plants through T3SS would be an ancestral trait of xanthomonads. Since its acquisition, T3SS has experienced a highly dynamic evolutionary history characterized by intense gene flux between species that may reflect its role in host adaptation.","publish_time":"2017-09-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Merda, D\u00E9borah; Briand, Martial; Bosis, Eran; Rousseau, C\u00E9line; Portier, Perrine; Barret, Matthieu; Jacques, Marie\u2010Agn\u00E8s; Fischer\u2010Le Saux, Marion","journal":"Mol Ecol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ac274c4280249196a1f3f31bb8df28017465b1ca.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7168496.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168496/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2MTk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Hrp2 family T3SS","Xanthomonas genus","distribution of T3SS","entire Hrp2 cluster","main virulence factor of Xanthomonas","commensal strains","genes shaped Hrp2 cluster polymorphism","main virulence determinant","gene level","Xanthomonas evolution","numerous epidemics","bacterial genus","main force","ancestral acquisitions","intense gene flux","Horizontal gene transfer","dynamic evolutionary history","successful pathogens responsible","effector genes","stepwise accumulation of numerous type","transmission patterns of virulence determinants","subsequent losses","bacteria responsible","secretion system","plant health","re\u2010acquisition","independent acquisitions","plant basal immunity","emergence of novel pathogens","ancestral trait of xanthomonads","interspecies homologous recombination of large fragments","pathogenic proteobacteria","xopF1","agroecosystems","xopM","genome sequences","major threat","xopR","contrast","reduced core effectome","comparative genomics","avrBs2","role","diversity","mutation","plants","capacity","host adaptation","data"],"language":"en"},

In the majority of nosocomial infections, there was a history of close contact with a SARS patient, and transmission occurred via large droplets, direct contact with infectious material or by contact with fomites contaminated by infectious material. In a few instances, potential airborne transmission was reported in association with endotracheal intubation, nebulised medications and non\u2010invasive positive pressure ventilation of SARS patients. In all SARS\u2010affected countries, nosocomial transmission of the disease was effectively halted by enforcement of routine standard, contact and droplet precautions in all clinical areas and additional airborne precautions in the high\u2010risk areas. In Hong Kong, where there are few private rooms for patient isolation, some hospitals have obtained good outcome by having designated SARS teams and separate wards for patient triage, confirmed SARS cases and step\u2010down of patients in whom SARS had been ruled out.

In the majority of patients, ground glass opacities on chest radiographs progress rapidly to focal, multifocal or diffuse consolidation. Unilateral involvement is common in the early acute phase, becoming bilateral at maximal lung involvement. Generally, radiographic opacities peak between 8 and 10 days after onset of illness, with radiographic scores reflecting temporal changes in clinical and laboratory parameters such as oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) and liver transaminases. Pleural effusions, cavitating consolidation and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are not typical radiographic features. Pneumomediastinum and pneumothoraces are complications that are associated with extensive disease, with or without assisted ventilation. The utility of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and CT scans lies in the confirmation of airspace opacities in cases with normal initial chest radiographs that have strong contact history and signs and symptoms highly suspicious of SARS during the outbreak, allowing early treatment and prompt isolation. The characteristic HRCT feature in the acute phase is ground\u2010glass opacities with smooth interlobular septal thickening, sometimes with consolidation in a subpleural location, which progress rapidly to involve other areas of the lungs. Temporal lung changes documented on HRCT suggest that some residual opacities found may not be reversible.","publish_time":"2003-11-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"OOI, Gaik Cheng; DAQING, Ma","journal":"Respirology","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/482a6c7fba8198de950acbf047bb7a5dad29704e.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7169195.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169195/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs2Njk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CT","SARS","HRCT"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["ground glass opacities","residual opacities","radiographic opacities peak","early acute phase","confirmation of airspace opacities","chest radiographs progress","cavitating consolidation","temporal changes","typical radiographic features","radiographic scores","diffuse consolidation","Temporal lung changes","characteristic HRCT feature","maximal lung involvement","normal initial chest radiographs","severe acute respiratory syndrome","suspicious of SARS","early treatment","space disease","extensive disease","Unilateral involvement","mediastinal lymphadenopathy","strong contact history","cases","laboratory parameters","smooth interlobular septal thickening","signs","symptoms","utility of high resolution computed tomography","CT scans","outbreak","oxygen saturation","Pleural effusions","onset of illness","majority of patients","SaO","complications","days","prompt isolation","pneumonia","causes","Pneumomediastinum","pneumothoraces","subpleural location","liver transaminases","areas","lungs","ventilation"],"language":"en"},

Knowledge about the distribution of incubation times is crucial in determining the length of quarantine period and is an important parameter in modelling the spread and control of SARS. As the exact time of infection is unknown for most patients, the incubation time cannot be determined. What is observable is the serial interval which is the time from the onset of symptoms in an index case to the onset of symptoms in a subsequent case infected by the index case. By constructing a convolution likelihood based on the serial interval data, we are able to estimate the incubation distribution which is assumed to be Weibull, and justifications are given to support this choice over other distributions. The method is applied to data provided by the Ministry of Health of Singapore and the results justify the choice of a ten\u2010day quarantine period. The indirect estimate obtained using the method of convolution likelihood is validated by means of comparison with a direct estimate obtained directly from a subset of patients for whom the incubation time can be ascertained. Despite its name, the proposed indirect estimate is actually more precise than the direct estimate because serial interval data are recorded for almost all patients, whereas exact incubation times can be determined for only a small subset. It is possible to obtain an even more efficient estimate by using the combined data but the improvement is not substantial.

In translational research projects, we have focused on the discovery of lead compounds for three major diseases: Alzheimer\u0027s disease (AD), breast cancer, and viral infections. In the AD project, we have taken a rational\u2010design approach and synthesized a new class of tricyclic pyrone (TP) compounds that preserve memory and motor functions in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin\u20101 (PS1) mice. TPs could protect neuronal death through several possible mechanisms, including their ability to inhibit the formation of both intraneuronal and extracellular amyloid \u03B2 (A\u03B2) aggregates, to increase cholesterol efflux, to restore axonal trafficking, and to enhance long\u2010term potentiation (LTP) and restored LTP following treatment with A\u03B2 oligomers. We have also synthesized a new class of gap\u2010junction enhancers, based on substituted quinolines, that possess potent inhibitory activities against breast\u2010cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Although various antiviral drugs are available, the emergence of viral resistance to existing antiviral drugs and various understudied viral infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, emphasizes the demand for the development of new antiviral agents against such infections and others.

The overwhelming number of hospitalizations due to hRSV-induced ALRTI each year is due, at least in part, to the lack of licensed vaccines against this virus. Thus, hRSV infection is considered a major public health problem and economic burden in most countries. The lung pathology developed in hRSV-infected individuals is characterized by an exacerbated proinflammatory and unbalanced Th2-type immune response. In addition to the adverse effects in airway tissues, hRSV infection can also cause neurologic manifestations in the host, such as seizures and encephalopathy. Although the origins of these extrapulmonary symptoms remain unclear, studies with patients suffering from neurological alterations suggest an involvement of the inflammatory response against hRSV. Furthermore, hRSV has evolved numerous mechanisms to modulate and evade the immune response in the host. Several studies have focused on elucidating the interactions between hRSV virulence factors and the host immune system, to rationally design new vaccines and therapies against this virus.

The global burden of food-borne diseases for 31 selected hazards was estimated by the World Health Organization at 33 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2010 with 40% of this burden concentrated among children under 5 years of age. The highest burden per population of food-borne diseases is found in Africa, followed by Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean sub-regions. Unsafe water used for the cleaning and processing of food is a key risk factors contributing to food-borne diseases. The role of quality and quantity of water to the general burden of infectious diseases deserves attention, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, as its effects go beyond the food chain. Water-related infectious diseases are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and climate change effects will exacerbate the challenges for the public health sector for both food-borne and water-borne diseases. Selected case studies from Africa and Asia show that (i) climate change extreme events, such as floods, may exacerbate the risks for infectious diseases spreading through water systems, and (ii) improvements related to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene could result in a significant reduction of intestinal parasitic infections among school-aged children. There is a need to better anticipate the impacts of climate change on infectious diseases and fostering multi-stakeholder engagement and multi-sectoral collaborations for integrated interventions at schools, community and household levels. The paper calls for giving priority to improving the environmental conditions affecting food-borne and water-borne infectious diseases under climate change.","publish_time":"2019-04-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ciss\u00E9, Gu\u00E9ladio","journal":"Acta Trop","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172250.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172250/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Southeast Asia","Eastern Mediterranean","Africa","Asia"],"keyphrases":["Water-related infectious diseases","general burden of infectious diseases","quantity of water","processing of food","drinking water","water systems","population of food","Unsafe water","food chain","global burden of food","climate change effects","impacts of climate change","climate change extreme events","highest burden","environmental factors","Africa","paper","Southeast Asia","major facts","selected hazards","environmental conditions","years of age","multi-sectoral collaborations","multi-stakeholder engagement","major cause of mortality","key risk factors","school-aged children","World Health Organization","public health sector","Selected case studies","disability-adjusted life years","schools","integrated interventions","significant reduction of intestinal parasitic infections","challenges","morbidity","link","community","hygiene","figures","Eastern Mediterranean sub-regions","attention","DALYs","view","floods","sanitation","improvements","cleaning","risks","focus","household levels","middle-income countries","priority","role of quality","need"],"language":"en"},

Despitea host range restricted to primates, experimental infection of rodents with certain genetically well defined poliovirus strains produces neurological disease. The outcome of infection of mice with mouse-adapted poliovirus strains has been described previously mainly in terms of paralysis and death, and it was generally assumed that these strains produce the same disease syndromes in normal mice and in mice transgenic for the human poliovirus receptor (hPVR-tg mice). We report a comparison of the clinical course and the histopathological features of neurological disease resulting from intracerebral virus inoculation in normal micewith those of murine poliomyelitis in hPVR-tg mice. The consistent pattern of clinical deficits in poliomyelitic transgenic mice contrasted with highly variable neurologic disease that developed in mice infected with different mouse-adapted polioviruses. Histopathological analysis showed a diffuse encephalomyelitis induced by specific poliovirus serotype 2 isolates in normal mice, that affected neuronal cell populations without discrimination, whereas in hPVR-tg animals, damage was restricted to spinal motor neurons. Mouse neurovirulent strains of poliovirus type 2 differed from mouse neurovirulent poliovirus type 1 derivatives in their ability to induce CNS lesions. Our findings indicate that the characteristic clinical appearance and highly specific histopathological features of poliomyelitis are mediated by the hPVR. Our data lead us to conclude that the tissue tropism of mouse-adapted poliovirus strains in normal mice is fundamentally different from that of poliovirus in hPVR-tg mice and primates, and that this is indicative of an as yet unknown mechanism of adsorption and uptake of the virus into cells of the murine CNS.","publish_time":"2005-03-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Gromeier, Matthias; Lu, Hui-Hua; Wimmer, Eckard","journal":"Microb Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/07466d0ad62aeec952044df53af8399a0dbe9799.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172458/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4MjY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["hPVR-tg mice","mice transgenic","mouse-adapted poliovirus strains","defined poliovirus strains","Mouse neurovirulent strains of poliovirus type","mouse neurovirulent poliovirus type","poliomyelitic transgenic mice","consequence of poliovirus infection","specific poliovirus serotype","human poliovirus receptor","hPVR-tg animals","primates","histopathological features of neurological disease","different mouse-adapted polioviruses","normal micewith","specific histopathological features of poliomyelitis","murine poliomyelitis","disease syndromes","tissue tropism of mouse","clinical course","variable neurologic disease","Histopathological analysis","murine CNS","outcome of infection","characteristic clinical appearance","experimental infection of rodents","consistent pattern of clinical deficits","CNS lesions","intracerebral virus inoculation","damage","diffuse encephalomyelitis","derivatives","uptake","discrimination","ability","neuronal cell populations","isolates","unknown mechanism of adsorption","Despitea host range","cells","spinal motor neurons","findings","terms of paralysis","death","comparison","data"],"language":"en"},

Tailed phages share a series of high-level taxonomic properties and show many facultative features that are unique or rare in viruses\u2014for example, tail appendages and unusual bases. They share with other viruses, especially herpesviruses, elements of morphogenesis and lifestyle that are attributed to convergent evolution. Tailed phages present three types of lysogeny, exemplified by phages \u03BB, Mu, and P1. Lysogeny appears as a secondary property acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Amino acid sequence alignments (notably of DNA polymerases, integrases, and peptidoglycan hydrolases) indicate frequent events of horizontal gene transfer in tailed phages. Common capsid and tail proteins have not been detected. Present-day tailed phages appear as chimeras, but their monophyletic origin is still inscribed in their morphology, genome structure, and replication strategy. It may also be evident in the three-dimensional structure of capsid and tail proteins.

Through decoration of immunogens on multivalent nanoparticles, designed nanovaccines can elicit improved humoral immunity.

Here, an alternative approach is illustrated integrating computational protein modeling and adaptive electroporation\u2010mediated synthetic DNA delivery, thus enabling direct in vivo production of nanovaccines. DNA\u2010launched nanoparticles are demonstrated displaying an HIV immunogen spontaneously self\u2010assembled in vivo. DNA\u2010launched nanovaccines induce stronger humoral responses than their monomeric counterparts in both mice and guinea pigs, and uniquely elicit CD8\u002B effector T\u2010cell immunity as compared to recombinant protein nanovaccines. Improvements in vaccine responses recapitulate when DNA\u2010launched nanovaccines with alternative scaffolds and decorated antigen are designed and evaluated. Finally, evaluation of functional immune responses induced by DLnanovaccines demonstrates that, in comparison to control mice or mice immunized with DNA\u2010encoded hemagglutinin monomer, mice immunized with a DNA\u2010launched hemagglutinin nanoparticle vaccine fully survive a lethal influenza challenge, and have substantially lower viral load, weight loss, and influenza\u2010induced lung pathology.

It is a major conservation threat in some endangered species. Infection can result in severe respiratory disease and fatal encephalitis. Diagnosis and disease monitoring in wildlife, and differentiation of CDV from rabies (a life-threatening zoonotic disease that can produce similar neurologic signs), would benefit from the availability of a portable, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test. We therefore developed a quantitative RT-PCR assay for CDV using shelf-stable, lyophilized reagents and target-specific primers and probes for use with the handheld Biomeme two3(\u2122) qPCR thermocycler. Biomeme\u2019s extraction methodology, lyophilized reagents, and thermocycler were compared to our standard laboratory-based methods to assess sensitivity, efficiency and overall test performance. Results using a positive control plasmid for CDV showed comparable sensitivity (detection of 50 copies) and PCR efficiency between the two platforms, and CDV detection was similar between platforms when tested using a modified live CDV vaccine. Significantly higher Ct values (average Ct = 5.1 cycles) were observed using the Biomeme platform on known CDV positive animal samples. CDV detection using the Biomeme platform was similar in 25 of 26 samples from suspect CDV cases when compared to standard virology laboratory testing. One false positive was observed that was negative upon retest. The Biomeme methodology can be adapted for detection of specific targets, and this portable technology saves time by eliminating the need for local or international sample transport for laboratory-based diagnostics. However, results of our testing suggest that decreased diagnostic sensitivity (higher Ct values) relative to laboratory-based methods was observed using animal samples, so careful validation and optimization are essential. Portable qPCR platforms can empower biologists and wildlife health professionals in remote and low-resource settings, which will greatly improve our understanding of CDV disease ecology and associated conservation threats in wildlife.","publish_time":"2020-04-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tomaszewicz Brown, Ania; McAloose, Denise; Calle, Paul P.; Auer, Angelika; Posautz, Annika; Slavinski, Sally; Brennan, Robin; Walzer, Chris; Seimon, Tracie A.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e391867b948f595cfe748251586ce599ad3e82ef.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7176111.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176111/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs5NzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CDV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CDV detection","differentiation of CDV","understanding of CDV disease ecology","suspect CDV cases","known CDV positive animal samples","modified live CDV vaccine","Biomeme platform","Biomeme methodology","standard laboratory-based methods","laboratory-based diagnostics","Portable qPCR platforms","diagnostic sensitivity","disease monitoring","higher Ct values","detection of specific targets","standard virology laboratory testing","comparable sensitivity","lyophilized reagents","life-threatening zoonotic disease","severe respiratory disease","average Ct","handheld Biomeme two3","PCR efficiency","qPCR thermocycler","portable technology","diagnostic test","false positive","Results","wildlife health professionals","positive control plasmid","similar neurologic signs","associated conservation threats","target-specific primers","major conservation threat","overall test performance","Biomeme\u2019s extraction methodology","quantitative RT-PCR assay","biologists","international sample transport","significant mortality","wild terrestrial","need","use","probes","shelf-stable","careful validation","multi-host pathogen","rabies","copies","low-resource settings","marine mammals","endangered species","point","optimization","time","fatal encephalitis","POC","cycles","Canine distemper virus","Infection","Diagnosis","availability","retest"],"language":"en"},

Although such information could be invaluable in preventing ventilator-induced lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients, clinical application of EIT is hindered by difficulties in interpreting the resulting images. One source of this difficulty is the frequent use of simple shapes which do not correspond to the anatomy to reconstruct EIT images. The mismatch between the true body shape and the one used for reconstruction is known to introduce errors, which to date have not been properly characterized. In the present study we, therefore, seek to 1) characterize and quantify the errors resulting from a reconstruction shape mismatch for a number of popular EIT reconstruction algorithms and 2) develop recommendations on the tolerated amount of mismatch for each algorithm. Using real and simulated data, we analyze the performance of four EIT reconstruction algorithms under different degrees of shape mismatch. Results suggest that while slight shape mismatch is well tolerated by all algorithms, using a circular shape severely degrades their performance.","publish_time":"2012-05-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Grychtol, Bart\u0142omiej; Lionheart, William R.

It was validated externally in a Caucasian population but has not been studied in Asian populations. The aim of this study was to validate APPS in Korean ARDS patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who were diagnosed with ARDS using the Berlin criteria and admitted to the medical ICU at Seoul National University Hospital from January 2015 to December 2016. The validation of the APPS was performed by evaluating its calibration and predictive accuracy. Its calibration was plotted and quantified using the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test. Its predictive accuracy was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC\u2013ROC) curve. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were analyzed, 32 of whom survived. Of the 116 patients, 11 (9.5%) were classified as APPS grade 1 (score 3\u20134), 88 (75.9%) as grade 2 (score 5\u20137) and 17 (14.6%) as grade 3 (score 8\u20139).

Data are also presented on aphid catches in suction traps at two heights and in light traps. Apart from colour sensitivity (yellow versus white) there was apparently a separate response to colour which in some species varied with season. Within yellow\u2010sensitive species there was also a differential response to colour. With the experimental methods used, it was not possible to define mathematically the active and passive landing components on cylindrical traps. Though the active landing component was large it varied between aphid species. Most species caught on horizontal traps at ground level had been flying above 1 m. In some species the response of males to colour and their landing behaviour differed from that of viviparae and oviparae. Four years data from suction traps suggest that aphid species can be divided into three categories on the basis of the height at which they normally fly. One group, mostly tree\u2010feeders, always show the greatest density at a high level (12.2 m) throughout the season. The second group always have the highest density at a low level (1 m) whilst a third group of species change at a specific date each autumn from a maximum density at 1\u201312.2 m.

Design Prospective multi\u2010institutional cross sectional study. Procedure Serum samples from owned cats presented to three inner city veterinary clinics in Sydney and feral cats from a colony in South Western Sydney over an 11\u2010month period were tested for FCoV antibodies using the Immunocomb test kit. The relationship between serological score and six major factors (breed, age, gender, number of cats per household, living environment and health status) in the owned cat sample population was analysed and compared to cats with FIP. Results The seroprevalence of FCoV infection in the sample population of owned and feral cats was 34% and 0%, respectively. The median Immunocomb scores of DSH, Persian, Siamese and Devon Rex cats were significantly lower than that of Burmese, BSH, Abyssinian, Birman, Ragdoll and Russian Blue. The median Immunocomb score of pedigree cats less than 2 years\u2010of\u2010age was significantly higher than for pedigree cats greater than 2 years\u2010of\u2010age. This distinction was not evident in DSH cats in these age groups. The number of cats per household at the time of blood collection had a strong positive association with Immunocomb score. The median Immunocomb score of cats with immunohistochemically confirmed FIP was significantly higher than cats in the sample population of owned cats but there was sufficient overlap between these two groups to make definitive diagnosis of FIP by serology impossible. Conclusion This represents the first seroprevalence study of FCoV in Australia. The major determinants of antibody score of owned cats identified in this study were breed, age and the number of cats per household. The significant relationship between the breed of the cat and the FCoV antibody titre further supports the notion, proposed previously by the authors, that breed related differences exist in the immunological response to FCoV infection.","publish_time":"2007-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"BELL, ET; TORIBIO, JALML; WHITE, JD; MALIK, R; NORRIS, JM","journal":"Aust Vet J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1344ff3a0781186a4ace7f4797cd8f06a7144de1.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159529/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs1ODk1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Feline Coronavirus","DSH"],"locations":["Sydney","South Western Sydney","Australia"],"keyphrases":["feral cats","number of cats","DSH cats","sample population of owned cats","median Immunocomb score of cats","FCoV antibody titres of owned cats","defined groups of cats","pedigree cats greater","Devon Rex cats","median Immunocomb score of pedigree cats","major determinants of antibody score of owned cats","seroprevalence of FCoV infection","seroprevalence study of FCoV","FCoV antibodies","age groups","breed","owned cat sample population","serological score","household","confirmed FIP","median Immunocomb scores of DSH","seroprevalence of Feline Coronavirus","Immunocomb test kit","major factors","increased risk of infection","definitive diagnosis of FIP","years","South Western Sydney","significant relationship","feline infectious peritonitis","Design Prospective multi\u2010institutional cross sectional study","Persian","inner city veterinary clinics","strong positive association","Birman","Siamese","colony","time of blood collection","gender","health status","Ragdoll","Abyssinian","BSH","immunological response","month period","related differences","Burmese","serology impossible","notion","environment","Procedure Serum samples","sufficient overlap","Russian Blue","authors","distinction","Australia","Objectives","Conclusion"],"language":"en"},

A review of this literature suggests that humans have been afflicted by viruses throughout their evolutionary history, although the number and types have changed. Some viruses show evidence of long\u2010standing intimate relationship and cospeciation with hominids, while others are more recently acquired from other species, including African monkeys and apes while our line was evolving in that continent, and domesticated animals and rodents since the Neolithic. Viral selection for specific resistance polymorphisms is unlikely, but in conjunction with other parasites, viruses have probably contributed to selection pressure maintaining major histocompatibility complex (MHC) diversity and a strong immune response. They may also have played a role in the loss in our lineage of N\u2010glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a cell\u2010surface receptor for many infectious agents. Shared viruses could have affected hominid species diversity both by promoting divergence and by weeding out less resistant host populations, while viruses carried by humans and other animals migrating out of Africa may have contributed to declines in other populations. Endogenous retroviral insertions since the divergence between humans and chimpanzees were capable of directly affecting hominid evolution through changes in gene expression and development.

One of the coping strategies for primates is to adjust their diet to these changes, and several studies have demonstrated the importance of fallback resources for this. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, might be particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because of their high dependence on fruit availability. Little is known, however, about bonobo feeding ecology in fragmented habitats and their use of fallback resources. In this study, we investigate diet seasonal variation and the exploitation of preferred and fallback foods in a bonobo population living in forest\u2010savannah mosaics. Results show that bonobos have adapted to this fragmented habitat by feeding on only a few fruit species, including an important number of non\u2010tree species (liana, herb and savannah shrub), in comparison to populations living in dense forests. These non\u2010tree plants have been defined as fallback and non\u2010preferred foods, which are most probably consumed to maintain high frugivory. Interestingly, we identified that preferred foods are all typical of mature forests while fallback resources are mainly found in forest edges or disturbed areas. This finding indicates that bonobos prefer to use mature forests when feeding, as they do for nesting, but extend their range use to forest areas in close proximity to humans when the availability of preferred fruits is low. Finally, we show that bonobo diet relies heavily on two abundant fallback fruits: Musanga cecropioides and Marantochloa leucantha. Other studies have demonstrated that the selection of abundant fallback resources enables primates to subsist at high densities and to maintain cohesive groups, as observed at this study site.

This study, for the first time, estimated the gross disbursement of Japan\u2019s DAH from 2012 to 2016 and clarified its flows, including source, aid type, channel, target region, and target health focus area. METHODS: Data on Japan Tracker, the first data platform of Japan\u2019s DAH, were used. The DAH definition was based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD) sector classification. Regarding core funding to non-health-specific multilateral agencies, we estimated DAH and its flows based on the OECD methodology for calculating imputed multilateral official development assistance (ODA). RESULTS: Japan\u2019s DAH was estimated at 1472.94 (2012), 823.15 (2013), 832.06 (2014), 701.98 (2015), and 894.57 million USD (2016) in constant prices of 2016. Multilateral agencies received the largest DAH share of 44.96\u201357.01% in these periods, followed by bilateral grants (34.59\u201353.08%) and bilateral loans (1.96\u201315.04%). Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) was the largest contributors to the DAH (76.26\u201382.68%), followed by Ministry of Finance (MOF) (10.86\u201316.25%). Japan\u2019s DAH was most heavily distributed in the African region with 41.64\u201353.48% share. The channel through which the most DAH went was Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (20.04\u201334.89%). Between 2012 and 2016, approximately 70% was allocated to primary health care and the rest to health system strengthening. CONCLUSIONS: With many major high-level health related meetings ahead, coming years will play a powerful opportunity to reevaluate DAH and shape the future of DAH for Japan. We hope that the results of this study will enhance the social debate for and contribute to the implementation of Japan\u2019s DAH with a more efficient and effective strategy.","publish_time":"2020-04-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nomura, Shuhei; Sakamoto, Haruka; Sugai, Maaya Kita; Nakamura, Haruyo; Maruyama-Sakurai, Keiko; Lee, Sangnim; Ishizuka, Aya; Shibuya, Kenji","journal":"Global Health","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/94460b239ad1bdf6d4347d92e7beac0aeed2e59b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161223.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161223/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs2ODc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["DAH","OECD","Ministry of Foreign Affairs","Ministry of Finance","Global Fund"],"locations":["Japan"],"keyphrases":["future of DAH","DAH definition","implementation of Japan\u2019s DAH","largest DAH share","data platform of Japan\u2019s DAH","gross disbursement of Japan\u2019s DAH","health system","primary health care","non-health-specific multilateral agencies","target health focus area","target region","major high-level health related meetings","Japan Tracker","channel","flows","study","RESULTS","imputed multilateral official development assistance","OECD methodology","African region","largest contributors","Ministry of Finance","bilateral grants","bilateral loans","Ministry of Foreign Affairs","Development\u2019s","aid type","diplomacy","MOFA","years","Organisation","ODA","rest","Economic Co-operation","developing countries","core funding","AIDS","Tuberculosis","source","Global Fund","sector classification","time","important means","CONCLUSIONS","METHODS","powerful opportunity","BACKGROUND","international community","social debate","effective strategy","USD","constant prices","Malaria","periods"],"language":"en"},

There is very good agreement between phylogenetic inferences derived from the electrophoretic data and those derived from the albumin immunological data. Protein variation detected by electrophoresis is relatively high among 17 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) examined. The mean number of alleles per locus (5.1 across all OTUs), levels of polymorphism (25% of loci), and heterozygosity (4\u20136%), are typical of, or greater than, values reported for other snakes. Species of uropeltids are genetically highly differentiated, as measured by genetic distances (lowest interspecific Nei\u0027s unbiased genetic distances, 0.22\u20100.27 among several Sri Lankan species; 2.3 between Teretrurus of India and other uropeltines). The phylogenetic tree most consistent with both the immunological and electrophoretic data shows uropeltines from Sri Lanka to be monophyletic, but the Indian species are paraphyletic with respect to those from Sri Lanka. Rhinophis travancoricus of India is inferred to be the sister taxon to the Sri Lankan radiation. As the genera are presently understood, neither Rhinophis nor Uropeltis appears to be monophyletic. A biogeographic scenario derived from the phylogenetic hypothesis suggests an early diversification of uropeltids in India, followed by a single invasion into the lowlands of Sri Lanka. Subsequent evolution on Sri Lanka resulted in occupation of montane biotopes. Cylindrophis is the sister group to uropeltines and is considered a member of the Uropeltidae. The immunological data indicate no phylogenetic association between uropeltids and other \u2018anilioid\u2019 taxa, specifically Anilius, Loxocemus or Xenopeltis, although we cannot rule out a very remote relationship. We specifically reject the hypothesis that uropeltines and scolecophidians form a clade relative to henophidians. High levels of genetic variation and a trend toward negative F(IS) values for polymorphic loci in three populations suggest generally large effective population sizes and outbreeding in these species. The niche\u2010width variation hypothesis for allozyme loci is not supported by the uropeltid data. In comparison to other vertebrates, the relationship between Nei\u0027s genetic distance and albumin immunological distance in uropeltids suggests either conservative albumin evolution or strong differentiation at electrophoretic loci.","publish_time":"2008-01-14T00:00:00Z","authors":"CADLE, JOHN E.; DESSAUER, HERBERT C.; GANS, CARL; GARTSIDE, DONALD F.","journal":"Biol J Linn Soc Lond","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/2f83470ba42e0493466d847fde82855ade329361.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161806/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs3MjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Multilocus","Rhinophis"],"organizations":["Uropeltis"],"locations":["India","Sri Lanka"],"keyphrases":["electrophoretic data","Species of uropeltids","albumin immunological data","Sri Lankan species","phylogenetic hypothesis","electrophoretic loci","uropeltines","lowlands of Sri Lanka","phylogenetic relationships","uropeltid data","albumin immunological distance","species of uropeltid snakes","phylogenetic inferences","phylogenetic association","phylogenetic tree","Sri Lankan radiation","Indian species","High levels of genetic variation","Nei\u0027s genetic distance","allozyme loci","polymorphic loci","conservative albumin evolution","width variation hypothesis","Multilocus electrophoretic methods","early diversification of uropeltids","Protein variation","Teretrurus of India","values","OTUs","Rhinophis travancoricus of India","primitive snakes","lowest interspecific Nei\u0027s unbiased genetic distances","microcomplement fixation comparisons of serum albumin","Subsequent evolution","sister taxon","population biology","sister group","levels of polymorphism","remote relationship","large effective population sizes","populations","strong differentiation","scolecophidians","aspects","negative F","trend","respect","single invasion","operational taxonomic units","Anilius","taxa","clade relative","anilioid","biogeography","electrophoresis","niche","occupation of montane biotopes","vertebrates","mean number of alleles","Loxocemus","henophidians","good agreement","Cylindrophis","biogeographic scenario","Xenopeltis","member","Uropeltis","Uropeltidae","genera","heterozygosity"],"language":"en"},

They illustrate mechanisms of viral persistence, including latent infections in which no infectious virus is readily evident, virus reactivation and viral\u2010induced tissue damage. These studies have also provided excellent paradigms to study the interactions between the immune system and the central nervous system (CNS). Although of interest in their own right, an understanding of the diverse mechanisms used by viruses to induce demyelination may shed light into the etiology and pathogenesis of the common demyelinating disorder multiple sclerosis (MS). This notion is supported by the persistent view that a viral infection acquired during adolescence might initiate MS after a long period of quiescence. Demyelination in both humans and rodents can be initiated by infection with a diverse group of enveloped and non\u2010enveloped RNA and DNA viruses (Table 1). The mechanisms that ultimately result in the loss of CNS myelin appear to be equally diverse as the etiological agents capable of causing diseases which result in demyelination. Although demyelination can be a secondary result of axonal loss, in many examples of viral induced demyelination, myelin loss is primary and associated with axonal sparing. This suggests that demyelination induced by viral infections can result from: 1) a direct viral infection of oligodendroglia resulting in cell death with degeneration of myelin and its subsequent removal; 2) a persistent viral infection, in the presence or absence of infectious virus, resulting in the loss of normal cellular homeostasis and subsequent oligodendroglial death; 3) a vigorous virus\u2010specific inflammatory response wherein the virus replicates in a cell type other than oligodendroglia, but cytokines and other immune mediators directly damage the oligodendroglia or the myelin sheath; or 4) infection initiates activation of an immune response specific for either oligodendroglia or myelin components. Virus\u2010induced inflammation may be associated with the processing of myelin or oligodendroglial components and their presentation to the host\u0027s own T cell compartment. Alternatively, antigenic epitopes derived from the viral proteins may exhibit sufficient homology to host components that the immune response to the virus activates autoreactive T cells, i.e. molecular mimicry. Although it is not clear that each of these potential mechanisms participates in the pathogenesis of human demyelinating disease, analysis of the diverse demyelinating viral infections of both humans and rodents provides examples of many of these potential mechanisms.","publish_time":"2006-04-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stohlman, Stephen A.; Hinton, David R.","journal":"Brain Pathol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/885bbab22b76af426ea2b5d7c14f6b9f83543ff3.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161848/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs3MzQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CNS"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["examples of viral induced demyelination","persistent viral infection","mechanisms of viral persistence","viral proteins","myelin loss","direct viral infection of oligodendroglia","diverse demyelinating viral infections","diverse mechanisms","myelin components","mechanisms of myelin destruction","loss of CNS myelin","cell death","virus reactivation","cell interactions","cell biology of oligodendroglia","vigorous virus","virus replicates","degeneration of myelin","processing of myelin","myelin sheath","potential mechanisms","complex cell","cell type","absence of infectious virus","immune response specific","immune system","T cell compartment","humans","induced inflammation","secondary result of axonal loss","induced tissue damage","immune mediators","oligodendroglial components","diverse group of enveloped","infection initiates activation","specific inflammatory response","subsequent oligodendroglial death","latent infections","rodents","pathogenesis of human demyelinating disease","loss of normal cellular homeostasis","DNA viruses","subsequent removal","persistent view","axonal sparing","common demyelinating disorder multiple sclerosis","non\u2010enveloped RNA","autoreactive T cells","central nervous system","analysis","presentation","presence","unique insights","host\u0027s","etiology","rodent models","sufficient homology","molecular mimicry","etiological agents capable","Table","diseases","cytokines","light","adolescence","long period of quiescence","excellent paradigms","antigenic epitopes","understanding","studies","notion","right"],"language":"en"},

In chronic wounds, bacterial colonization is associated with impaired healing. Cold atmospheric plasma is an innovative promising tool to deal with these problems. Objectives The 5\u2010min argon plasma treatment has already demonstrated efficacy in reducing bacterial numbers in chronic infected wounds in vivo. In this study we investigated a 2\u2010min plasma treatment with the same device and the next\u2010generation device, to assess safety and reduction in bacterial load, regardless of the kind of bacteria and their resistance level in chronic wounds. Methods Twenty\u2010four patients with chronic infected wounds were treated in a prospective randomized controlled phase II study with 2 min of cold atmospheric argon plasma every day: 14 with MicroPlaSter alpha device, 10 with MicroPlaSter beta device (next\u2010generation device) in addition to standard wound care. The patient acted as his/her own control. Bacterial species were detected by standard bacterial swabs and bacterial load by semiquantitative count on nitrocellulose filters. The plasma settings were the same as in the previous phase II study in which wounds were exposed for 5 min to argon plasma. Results Analysis of 70 treatments in 14 patients with the MicroPlaSter alpha device revealed a significant (40%, P \u003C 0\u00B7016) reduction in bacterial load in plasma\u2010treated wounds, regardless of the species of bacteria. Analysis of 137 treatments in 10 patients with the MicroPlaSter beta device showed a highly significant reduction (23\u00B75%, P \u003C 0\u00B7008) in bacterial load. No side\u2010effects occurred and the treatment was well tolerated. Conclusions A 2\u2010min treatment with either of two cold atmospheric argon plasma devices is a safe, painless and effective technique to decrease the bacterial load in chronic wounds.","publish_time":"2012-07-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Isbary, G.; Heinlin, J.; Shimizu, T.; Zimmermann, J.L.; Morfill, G.; Schmidt, H.\u2010U.; Monetti, R.; Steffes, B.; Bunk, W.; Li, Y.; Klaempfl, T.; Karrer, S.; Landthaler, M.; Stolz, W.","journal":"Br J Dermatol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6ca13424082c02ab3bd58c5f57b35133498b4f5.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7161860.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161860/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs3Mzg1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bacterial load","chronic wounds","Bacterial species","argon plasma treatment","bacterial colonization","bacterial numbers","Cold atmospheric plasma","chronic infected wounds","generation device","treated wounds","plasma settings","MicroPlaSter beta device","MicroPlaSter alpha device","standard bacterial swabs","cold atmospheric argon plasma devices","patients","study","significant reduction","treatments","species of bacteria","resistance level","previous phase","kind of bacteria","Results Analysis","standard wound care","development of antibiotic resistance","prospective randomized controlled phase","day","semiquantitative count","microorganisms","efficacy","innovative promising tool","addition","effective technique","safety","increasing problem","nitrocellulose filters","Methods","medicine","impaired healing","problems","Objectives","side\u2010effects","Conclusions"],"language":"en"},

Cellular lectins can recognize glycans on viral surface proteins and mediate viral uptake into immune cells for subsequent antigen presentation. Paradoxically, many viral and non\u2010viral pathogens target lectins to attach to immune cells and to subvert cellular functions to promote their spread. Thus, it has been proposed that attachment of HIV to the dendritic cell lectin DC\u2010SIGN enables the virus to hijack cellular transport processes to ensure its transmission to adjacent T cells. However, recent studies show that the consequences of viral capture by immune cell lectins can be diverse, and can entail negative and positive regulation of viral spread.

Here, a comparative analysis of the membrane permeabilization capacity of a number of viroporins was performed in baby hamster kidney cells. Synthesis of 6K protein from Sindbis virus, E from mouse hepatitis virus, M2 from influenza A virus, and 2B and 3A from poliovirus enhanced membrane permeability to different extents. We show that two proteins from hepatitis C virus, p7 and NS4A, also display viroporin activity to a level comparable to 6K protein. In addition to their capacity to disrupt ionic cellular homeostasis and promote bacterial cell lysis, the expressed viroporins were able to induce cell death. Degradation of internucleosomal DNA and generation of apoptotic bodies were observed upon viroporin expression. Consistently, cleavage of translation initiation factor 4GI and poly\u2010(ADP\u2010ribose) polymerase indicated activation of effector caspase\u20103. We found that poliovirus 2B localizes partially in mitochondria and induces an anomalous perinuclear distribution of these organelles.

Finally, detection of cytochrome c release from mitochondria suggests involvement of the mitochondrial pathway in viroporin\u2010induced apoptosis.

Several electroactive DNA intercalators, including the organic dye methylene blue (MB), anthraquinone derivatives, and the metal complexes Fe(phen)(3) (2\u002B) and Ru(phen)(3) (2\u002B), have been tested for using in combination with thermoplastic olefin polymer of amorphous structure (Topas) CE\u2010microchips and ED. Two end\u2010channel approaches for integration of gold wire electrodes in CE\u2010ED microchip were used. A 250 \u03BCm diameter gold wire was manually aligned at the outlet of the separation channel. A new approach based on a guide channel for integration of 100 and 50 \u03BCm diameter gold wire has been also developed in order to reduce the background current and the baseline noise level. Modification of gold wire electrodes has been also tested to improve the detector performance. Application of MCE\u2010ED for ssDNA detection has been studied and demonstrated for the first time using the electroactive dye MB.

It is composed of a highly conserved N\u2010terminal region, which is homological to group\u20101 cystatin, and a repetitive peptide at the C\u2010terminus. The purified recombinant proteins of tarocystatin, such as full\u2010length (FL), N\u2010terminus (Nt) and C\u2010terminus (Ct) peptides, were produced and their inhibitory activities against papain as well as their antifungal effects were investigated. Kinetic analysis revealed that FL peptide exhibited mixed type inhibition (K (ia) = 0.098 \u03BCm and K (ib) = 0.252 \u03BCm) and Nt peptide showed competitive inhibition (K (i) = 0.057 \u03BCm), whereas Ct peptide possessed weak papain activation properties. A shift in the inhibitory pattern from competitive inhibition of Nt peptide alone to mixed type inhibition of FL peptide implied that the Ct peptide has an regulatory effect on the function of FL peptide. Based on the inhibitory kinetics of FL (group\u20102) and Nt (group\u20101) peptides on papain activity, an inhibitory mechanism of group\u20102 phytocystatins and a regulatory mechanism of extended Ct peptide have each been proposed. By contrast, the antifungal activity of Nt peptide appeared to be greater than that of FL peptide, and the Ct peptide showed no effect on antifungal activity, indicating that the antifungal effect is not related to proteinase inhibitory activity. The results are valid for most phytocystatins with respect to the inhibitory mechanism against cysteine proteinase.","publish_time":"2008-09-10T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Ke\u2010Ming; Kumar, Senthil; Cheng, Yi\u2010Sheng; Venkatagiri, Shripathi; Yang, Ai\u2010Hwa; Yeh, Kai\u2010Wun","journal":"FEBS J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/74e0db2d29bd229cc9934ea14d748e3422166084.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7164091.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164091/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjs5MzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["repetitive peptide","function of FL peptide","antifungal activity of Nt peptide","competitive inhibition of Nt peptide","mixed type inhibition of FL peptide","inhibitory mechanism of group","regulatory mechanism of extended Ct peptide","inhibitory kinetics of FL","proteinase inhibitory activity","inhibitory pattern","papain activity","inhibitory activities","terminus","\u03BCm","regulatory effect","antifungal effects","phytocystatins","peptides","weak papain activation properties","cysteine proteinase","conserved N","purified recombinant proteins of tarocystatin","defense protein","respect","terminal region","phytopathogenic nematodes","fungi","Colocasia esculenta","Kinetic analysis","shift","contrast","results"],"language":"en"},

Evidence suggests that atopic individuals may be predisposed to more severe rhinoviral colds coupled to a worsening of existing airway disease than those with asthma. The role of atopy and IgE levels, as well as their relationship to clinical disease expression have not been defined. We hypothesized that an allergic diathesis modulates rhinoviral colds and have initiated studies of normal, atopic and asthmatic subjects employing experimental rhinoviral infection, with measurements of symptom scores, viral shedding and cultures, albumin in nasal washes and serological responses. Twenty\u2010two subjects (11 normal, 5 atopic, 6 atopic and asthmatic) participated and were inoculated with human rhinovirus serotype 16 (HRV 16). Measurements of neutralizing antibody and viral culture were performed at screening, pre\u2010inoculation, during the cold and at 8\u201310 weeks convalescence. Daily symptoms were noted, nasal washes done, IgE measured and atopy was diagnosed by skin tests. Seventeen volunteers developed clinical colds as assessed by symptom scores, virus shedding was demonstrated (with positive culture) in all subjects and a fourfold or higher seroconversion occurred in 11/22. Neutralizing HRV antibody developed unexpectedly in 10 subjects between screening and inoculation and the presence or absence of this pre\u2010inoculation antibody determined subsequent severity of colds in normal but not in atopic subjects. Atopic antibody positive individuals developed severe clinical colds that were independent of preinoculation antibody in contrast to normal subjects who developed mild colds in the presence of a neutralizing antibody (.P= 0.01). Both atopic and normal antibody negative subjects developed severe colds. This differential response was matched by nasal wash albumin levels which were significantly increased (P= 0\u201301) during the cold in atopic (but not in normal) volunteers with pre\u2010inoculation antibody. Levels of IgE were not correlated with severity of clinical disease or viral shedding. Our studies of HRV disease in atopic subjects suggest heightened susceptibility to the detrimental effects of colds; additional studies are needed to clarify the relevant mechanisms.","publish_time":"2006-04-27T00:00:00Z","authors":"BARDIN, P.

Basehne tests included viral serology. microbiological culture and polymerase chain reaction for rhinovirus infection (HRV\u2010PCR), histamine bronchial provocation and bronchoscopy. Twenty subjects (eight atopic) underwent repeat tests when they developed a cold. Results Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) was significantly lower during colds (\u20100.19L [95% confidence mterval \u20100.10, \u20100.29], P= 0,0004) and there was a significant increase in bronchial responsiveness (\u002B0.62 doublings of the dose\u2010response slope [\u002B0.24, \u002B1.00], P=0.003). Eight subjects (two atopic) had a diagnosed viral infection: two HRV. three coronavirus (HCV), one HRV \u002B HCV, one parainfluenza III(PI) and one respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (also Haemophilus influenzae). In biopsies, during colds, total eosinophils (EG1(\u002B)) increased significantly (geometric mean 6.73\u2010fold [1.12,40.46], P=O.04). Activated eosinophils (EG2(\u002B)) only increased significantly in the subgroup without diagnosed viral infection and particularly in atopic rhinitics. T\u2010suppressor (CD8(\u002B)) cells also increased significantly (median \u002B178.3 cells mm(2), P= 0.004). Epithelial expression of intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101 (ICAM\u20101) expression increased in four atopic rhinitics during colds.

Conclusion Lower airway inflammation was present in atopic and non\u2010atopic normal subjects with colds.

While multiple methods having been created to characterize this variation through the identification of groups of species that tend to co\u2010occur, most of these methods unfortunately are not able to represent gradual variation in species composition. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is a mixed\u2010membership method that can represent gradual changes in community structure by delineating overlapping groups of species, but its use has been limited because it requires abundance data and requires users to a priori set the number of groups. We substantially extend LDA to accommodate widely available presence/absence data and to simultaneously determine the optimal number of groups. Using simulated data, we show that this model is able to accurately determine the true number of groups, estimate the underlying parameters, and fit with the data. We illustrate this method with data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). Overall, our model identified 18 main bird groups, revealing striking spatial patterns for each group, many of which were closely associated with temperature and precipitation gradients. Furthermore, by comparing the estimated proportion of each group for two time periods (1997\u20132002 and 2010\u20132015), our results indicate that nine (of 18) breeding bird groups exhibited an expansion northward and contraction southward of their ranges, revealing subtle but important community\u2010level biodiversity changes at a continental scale that are consistent with those expected under climate change. Our proposed method is likely to find multiple uses in ecology, being a valuable addition to the toolkit of ecologists.","publish_time":"2018-08-26T00:00:00Z","authors":"Valle, Denis; Albuquerque, Pedro; Zhao, Qing; Barberan, Albert; Fletcher, Robert J.","journal":"Glob Chang Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/18c8acf67b1858bc3b60bd0ac35a01ecd176d817.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7165608.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165608/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsxMg2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["LDA","the North American Breeding Bird Survey"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["breeding bird groups","overlapping groups of species","identification of groups","main bird groups","true number of groups","optimal number of groups","model","species composition","absence data","abundance data","simulated data","gradual changes","membership method","ecology","proposed method","gradual variation","LDA","multiple methods","North American Breeding Bird Survey","important community","community structure","multiple uses","time periods","level biodiversity changes","expansion northward","ranges","striking spatial patterns","continental scale","contraction southward","BBS","space","valuable addition","Latent Dirichlet Allocation","available presence","toolkit of ecologists","users","underlying parameters","estimated proportion","temperature","precipitation gradients","climate change","results"],"language":"en"},

These SQGs are useful for a screening line of evidence (LOE) that can be combined with other LOEs in a full weight of evidence (WOE) assessment of impacted sites. Three common multichemical hazard quotient methods (probable effect concentration [PEC]\u2010Q(avg), PEC\u2010Q(met), and PEC\u2010Q(sum)) and a novel (hazard score [HZD]) approach were used in conjunction with a consensus\u2010based set of SQGs to evaluate the ability of different scoring metrics to predict the biological effects of sediment contamination under field conditions. Multivariate analyses were first used to categorize river sediments into distinct habitats based on a set of physicochemical parameters to include gravel, low and high flow sand, and silt. For high flow sand and gravel, no significant dose\u2013response relationships between numerically dominant species and various toxicity metric scores were observed. Significant dose\u2013response relationships were observed for chironomid abundances and toxicity scores in low flow sand and silt habitats. For silt habitats, the HZD scoring metric provided the best predictor of chironomid abundances compared to various PEC\u2010Q methods according to goodness\u2010of\u2010fit tests. For low flow sand habitats, PEC\u2010Q(sum) followed by HZD, provided the best predictors of chironomid abundance. Differences in apparent chironomid toxicity between the 2 habitats suggest habitat\u2010specific differences in chemical bioavailability and indicator taxa sensitivity. Using an IBI method, the HZD, PEC\u2010Q(avg), and PEC\u2010Q(met) approaches provided reasonable correlations with calculated IBI values in both silt and low flow sand habitats but not for gravel or high flow sands.

In this review, we describe the mechanisms by which amino acid changes in viral proteins may affect epitope recognition by virus\u2010specific CTL, and discuss the viral and immunological basis for the emergence of viral variants bearing such amino acid changes during infection. We then consider the impact that viral variation may have on the host CTL response and its ability to contain virus replication. We argue that the emergence of a viral variant demonstrates that it must have an in vivo replicative advantage, and that as such, the variant must tip the balance between virus replication and immune control somewhat in favor of the virus. Further, we suggest that although the immune response can evolve to recognize new viral epitopes, the CTL generated following such evolution frequently have a reduced ability to contain virus replication. We conclude that this escape mechanism likely does make a significant contribution to persistence/pathogenesis during a number of different virus infections.","publish_time":"2006-04-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Borrow, Persephone; Shaw, George M.","journal":"Immunol Rev","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/1506d4f2b3a936f8ea5d04e5db5b525d7ee0c713.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165923/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["CTL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["virus replication","viral proteins","viral variation","emergence of viral variants","specific CTL","new viral epitopes","number of persistent virus infections","number of different virus infections","immune response","host CTL response","amino acid changes","immune control","epitope recognition","reduced ability","specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes","pathogenesis","cases","balance","significant contribution","immunological basis","persistence","mechanisms","favor","significance","evolution","escape mechanism","impact","Summary","replicative advantage","review"],"language":"en"},

Aminopeptidase N (CD13) has been implicated in most of these phenomena, although its participation has been attributed to its enzymatic activity, while its role as an adhesion molecule has been almost unexplored. Here, we show that certain anti\u2010CD13 monoclonal antibodies induce HA of monocytic U\u2010937 cells, independently of their effect on enzymatic activity. The phenomenon is related to binding to a specific site on the CD13 molecule and is independent of integrins. It is abrogated by low temperature, by the glycolysis inhibitor 2\u2010deoxyglucose, and by inhibitors of tyrosine and mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases. The inhibitor of microtubule polymerization colchicine has a synergistic effect on CD13\u2010mediated aggregation, suggesting an inhibitory role of microtubules in this process. Finally, during HA, CD13 actively redistributes to the zones of cell\u2010cell contact, as determined by live cell imaging studies, demonstrating a direct role of CD13 in the adhesion phenomenon. Together, these data show for the first time the participation of CD13 in monocytic cell adhesion.","publish_time":"2006-01-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Mina\u2010Osorio, Paola; Shapiro, Linda H.; Ortega, Enrique","journal":"J Leukoc Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/ec11b05a68b2b26a2f0a0c4c7a0ac39da5680e00.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7166514.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166514/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjsxNzI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["CD13 molecule","participation of CD13","direct role of CD13","monocytic cell adhesion","cell contact","zones of cell","adhesion molecule","adhesion phenomenon","tumor cell invasion","certain anti\u2010CD13 monoclonal antibodies","cells","HA of monocytic U","live cell imaging studies","enzymatic activity","inhibitory role of microtubules","synergistic effect","mediated aggregation","Homotypic aggregation","glycolysis inhibitor","inhibitor of microtubule polymerization colchicine","angiogenesis","immune responses","key roles","pathological processes","mitogen","inhibitors of tyrosine","embryogenesis","activated protein kinases","deoxyglucose","specific site","time","low temperature","binding","metastasis","independent of integrins","Aminopeptidase N","data","phenomena"],"language":"en"},

Methods: 1002 respiratory specimens were tested for HCoVs. The clinical and epidemiological data were compared on the basis of the type HCoV infection. Results: A hundred coronaviruses, 33 NL63, 2229E, 27 OC43 and 38 HKU1, were detected in 97 (9.8%) of 1002 samples negative in routine tests. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the study children were compared in three groups, 24 OC43\u2010, 27 NL63\u2010 and 34 HKU1\u2010infected children. HCoVs were identified mainly in children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (50.5% vs. 29.4%).

Conclusions: HCoV detection in hospitalised children without any other respiratory virus detection was associated with upper and a significant rate of lower respiratory tract illness. The four types of HCoVs were detected, and new types NL63 and HKU1 represented a substantial portion of detection.

Of the 16 cats with neurologic FIP, 15 were less than 2 years of age and all 16 originated from large multiplecat households. The most useful antemortem indicators of disease were positive anti\u2010coronavirus IgG titer in cerebrospinal fluid, high serum total protein concentration, and findings on magnetic resonance imaging suggesting periventricular contrast enhancement, ventricular dilatation, and hydrocephalus. Postmortem diagnosis was facilitated by FIP monoclonal antibody staining of affected tissue and coronavirus\u2010specific polymerase chain reaction. Most cats with neurologic and ocular forms of FIP had patchy, focal lesions, suggesting that recently developed technologies described in this report may be useful for evaluation of cats with suspected FIP.","publish_time":"2008-02-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Foley, Janet E.; Lapointe, Jean\u2010Martin; Koblik, Philip; Poland, Amy; Pedersen, Niels C.","journal":"J Vet Intern Med","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d9ceda91179c7b38b9fb075925f6bba7877ddb72.json","pmc_json_files":null,"url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167019/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjszMzc1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["FIP virus","nonneurologic FIP","suspected FIP","clinical neurologic FIP","control cats","evaluation of cats","domestic cats","ocular forms of FIP","primary neurologic disease","type immune response of cats","FIP monoclonal antibody staining of affected tissue","Postmortem diagnosis","ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus","useful antemortem indicators of disease","accurate diagnosis","positive anti\u2010coronavirus IgG titer","postmortem diagnostic tests","Feline infectious peritonitis","cerebrospinal fluid","findings","high serum total protein concentration","periventricular contrast enhancement","magnetic resonance imaging","infection","mutant","fatal Arthus","ventricular dilatation","specific polymerase chain reaction","focal lesions","common subset","single organ system","report","FECV","developed technologies","hydrocephalus","intention","large multiplecat households","manifestations","years of age"],"language":"en"},

Pulmonary sequelae have been documented following respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients; however potential late effects in children undergoing nonmyeloablative chemotherapy have not been investigated. AIM: To evaluate the long\u2010term pulmonary morbidity of respiratory viral infections during chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Childhood ALL survivors, aged 7 to 18 years, greater than 6 months posttreatment were recruited. Exclusion criteria included HSCT or proven bacterial/fungal respiratory infection during treatment. Subjects were classified into \u201Cviral\u201D or \u201Ccontrol\u201D groups according to retrospective medical records that documented the presence of laboratory\u2010proven RVIs during chemotherapy. Symptom questionnaires (Liverpool, ISAAC) and lung function testing (spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity, forced oscillation technique to ATS/ERS standards) were then performed cross\u2010sectionally at the time of recruitment. RESULTS: Fifty\u2010four patients (31 viral, 23 control) were recruited: median (range) age 11.2 (7.2\u201018.1) years, and at 4.9 (0.5\u201013) years posttherapy. Abnormalities were detected in 17 (31%) individuals (8 viral, 9 control), with the most common being DLCO impairment (3 viral, 4 control) and reduced respiratory reactance at 5 Hz (5 viral, 6 control). Children with RVIs during chemotherapy reported more current respiratory symptoms, particularly wheeze (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9\u201010.0; P = .09) and cough (OR, 2.7; 95% CI: 0.8\u20109.5; P = .11). No differences in lung function tests were observed between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found children with RVIs during chemotherapy developed more long\u2010term respiratory symptoms than controls; however, differences did not reach statistical significance. No differences in static lung function were found between the two groups. Overall, pulmonary abnormalities and/or significant ongoing respiratory symptoms were detected in nearly a third of ALL survivors treated without HSCT. Larger, prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the etiology and clinical significance of these findings.","publish_time":"2019-08-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lin, Beryl; Kennedy, Brendan; McBride, Jamie; Dalla\u2010Pozza, Luciano; Trahair, Toby; McCowage, Geoffrey; Coward, Emma; Plush, Leanne; Robinson, Paul D.; Hardaker, Kate; Widger, John; Ng, Anthea; Jaffe, Adam; Selvadurai, Hiran","journal":"Pediatr Pulmonol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0050cb5ead95958706cd183ab1115e70c6a626ba.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7167615.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167615/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzExLmNzdjs0MDQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1419103,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:33:53Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"fhkeSoSLQSwp2JPssKzyvg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_11.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSCT","DLCO"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Respiratory viruses","respiratory reactance","following respiratory viral infections","long\u2010term respiratory symptoms","current respiratory symptoms","long\u2010term pulmonary morbidity of respiratory viral infections","fungal respiratory infection","significant ongoing respiratory symptoms","proven RVIs","nonmyeloablative chemotherapy","immunosuppressed children","HSCT","differences","groups","pulmonary abnormalities","lung function testing","lung function tests","static lung function","Pulmonary sequelae","survivors","years posttherapy","common cause of infection","clinical significance","statistical significance","recipients","plethysmography","oscillation technique","hematopoietic stem cell transplant","potential late effects","diffusing capacity","ISAAC","spirometry","presence of laboratory","ERS standards","ATS","retrospective medical records","Liverpool","wheeze","acute lymphoblastic leukemia","etiology","Exclusion criteria","cancer therapy","study","controls","Hz","odds ratio","DLCO impairment","Symptom questionnaires","findings","months posttreatment","BACKGROUND","patients","prospective studies","range","age","confidence interval","METHODS","Childhood","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","AIM","individuals","time of recruitment","cough","Subjects"],"language":"en"},

A randomized controlled trial comparing oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 3 days) with placebo in hospitalized wheezing children (n = 266, median 1.6 years, range 3 months to 15.2 years) was conducted. In this post\u2010hoc analysis, we assessed the link between the efficacy of prednisolone and several atopic characteristics, such as atopy, aeroallergen sensitization, total IgE level, number of sensitizations, eczema, atopic eczema, blood or nasal eosinophils, exhaled nitric oxide, positive modified asthma predictive index/asthma, inhaled corticosteroid medication and parental asthma/allergy. Virology was studied comprehensively. Our primary endpoint was the time until ready for discharge, and the most important secondary endpoint was the occurrence of relapses during the following 2 months. For statistics, we used interaction analyses in uni\u2010 and multivariate regression models. Overall, prednisolone did not decrease any of our predefined clinical endpoints. Neither was the efficacy of prednisolone associated with atopy. However, prednisolone significantly decreased the time until ready for discharge in children with positive modified asthma predictive index/asthma, inhaled corticosteroids, or rhinovirus infection and/or in children without azithromycin treatment. Prednisolone significantly decreased relapses in children with eczema, nasal eosinophilia and rhinovirus infection. The multiple clinical, inflammatory and viral markers associating with the efficacy of prednisolone should be confirmed in prospective trials.

In the present study, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) assays were used to analyse the expression of angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS\u2010CoV spike (S) protein, and some pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines (PICs) including MCP\u20101, TGF\u2010\u03B21, TNF\u2010\u03B1, IL\u20101\u03B2, and IL\u20106 in autopsy tissues from four patients who died of SARS.

High levels of PICs were expressed in the SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected ACE2(\u002B) cells, but not in the uninfected cells.

Because the mortality rate of SARS patients is very high, understanding the pathological mechanisms of SARS not only in vivo but in vitro is important for the prevention of SARS. Activation of signaling pathways caused by SARS\u2010CoV infection leads to the phosphorylation and activation of downstream molecules. Two conflicting cellular programs, apoptosis to eliminate virus\u2010infected cells and survival to delay apoptosis by producing antiviral cytokines, occur in SARS patients. Recent studies regarding SARS and SARS\u2010CoV have clarified that activation of mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases (MAPKs) plays important roles in upregulation of cytokine expression and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Both Akt and p38 MAPK are keys for determination of cell survival or death in SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells in vitro. Agents being developed to target these signaling cascades may be important for the design of anti\u2010SARS\u2010CoV drugs.

To discover unknown UGATs, we fully annotated potential UGATs from Glycyrrhiza uralensis using deep transcriptome sequencing. The catalytic functions of candidate UGATs were determined by an in vitro enzyme assay. Systematically screening 434 potential UGATs, we unexpectedly found one unique GuUGAT that was able to catalyse the glucuronosylation of glycyrrhetinic acid to directly yield glycyrrhizin via continuous two\u2010step glucuronosylation.

For HA, 16 distinct subtypes (H1\u2013H16) exist, while nine exist for NA. The epidemic strains of H1N1 IAV change frequently and cause annual seasonal epidemics as well as occasional pandemics, such as the notorious 1918 influenza pandemic. The recent introduction of pandemic A/H1N1 IAV (H1N1pdm virus) into humans re-emphasizes the public health concern about H1N1 IAV. Several studies have identified conserved epitopes within specific HA subtypes that can be used for diagnostics. However, immune specific epitopes in H1N1 IAV have not been completely assessed. In this study, linear epitopes on the H1N1pdm viral HA protein were identified by peptide scanning using libraries of overlapping peptides against convalescent sera from H1N1pdm patients. One epitope, P5 (aa 58\u201372) was found to be immunodominant in patients and to evoke high titer antibodies in mice. Multiple sequence alignments and in silico coverage analysis showed that this epitope is highly conserved in influenza H1 HA [with a coverage of 91.6% (9,860/10,767)] and almost completely absent in other subtypes [with a coverage of 3.3% (792/23,895)]. This previously unidentified linear epitope is located outside the five well-recognized antigenic sites in HA. A peptide ELISA method based on this epitope was developed and showed high correlation (\u03C7(2) = 51.81, P\u003C0.01, Pearson correlation coefficient R = 0.741) with a hemagglutination inhibition test.

Central Africa in general and Gabon in particular are privileged areas for the emergence of zoonotic EIDs. Indeed, human incursions in Gabonese forests for exploitation purposes lead to intensified contacts between humans and wildlife thus generating an increased risk of emergence of zoonotic diseases. In Gabon, 51 endemic or potential endemic viral infectious diseases have been reported. Among them, 22 are of zoonotic origin and involve 12 families of viruses. The most notorious are dengue, yellow fever, ebola, marburg, Rift Valley fever and chikungunya viruses. Potential EID due to wildlife in Gabon are thereby plentiful and need to be inventoried. The Gabonese Public Health system covers geographically most of the country allowing a good access to sanitary information and efficient monitoring of emerging diseases. However, access to treatment and prevention is better in urban areas where medical structures are more developed and financial means are concentrated even though the population is equally distributed between urban and rural areas. In spite of this, Gabon could be a good field for investigating the emergence or re-emergence of zoonotic EID. Indeed Gabonese health research structures such as CIRMF, advantageously located, offer high quality researchers and facilities that study pathogens and wildlife ecology, aiming toward a better understanding of the contact and transmission mechanisms of new pathogens from wildlife to human, the emergence of zoonotic EID and the breaking of species barriers by pathogens.","publish_time":"2010-06-03T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bourgarel, M; Wauquier, N; Gonzalez, J-P","journal":"Emerg Health Threats J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/d4d15fb77f993153439d9ebd90c649962ee398e9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3167654.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3167654/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2Ozcw0","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["EID","Gabon","Rift Valley","CIRMF"],"locations":["Central Africa"],"keyphrases":["zoonotic diseases","re-emergence of zoonotic EID","emergence of zoonotic EIDs","Potential EID","zoonotic origin","zoonotic infectious agents","EID events","Emerging infectious diseases","wildlife ecology","urban areas","potential endemic viral infectious diseases","Gabonese health research structures","Gabonese Public Health system","study pathogens","Gabonese forests","increased risk of emergence","privileged areas","efficient monitoring of emerging diseases","good access","rural areas","yellow fever","transmission mechanisms of new pathogens","medical structures","human incursions","good field","chikungunya viruses","better understanding","families of viruses","Rift Valley fever","exploitation purposes lead","ebola","marburg","facilities","sanitary information","intensified contacts","humans","high quality researchers","CIRMF","breaking of species barriers","financial means","dengue","country","prevention","major threat","Central Africa","treatment","population","spite"],"language":"en"},

RESULTS: The age distribution of all the subjects was relatively even. Over 90% of cases occurred during a two-month period. Two hundred and five patients (94.5%) received oseltamivir within 48 h of fever onset, and 97% of inpatients defervesced within 48 h of medication. The group with pneumonia included more males than females, and had higher leukocytes counts with lower lymphocyte differentials than the group without pneumonia. The white blood cell count and lymphocyte differential were associated with the severity of pneumonia.

There is strong evidence that pDCs could play a major role in the initial orchestration of both innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses.

METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational study of critically ill adult patients with pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation conducted in 10 academic hospitals in Canada, the United States, and Central Europe. PCT was measured daily for 14 days using an immuno-luminometric assay. RESULTS: We included 175 patients, 57 with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), 61 with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and 57 with hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). Initial PCT levels were higher in CAP than VAP patients (median (interquartile range: IQR); 2.4 (0.95 to 15.8) vs. 0.7 (0.3 to 2.15), ng/ml, P \u003C 0.001) but not significantly different to HAP (2.2 (0.4 to 8.0) ng/ml). The 28-day ICU mortality rate for all patients was 18.3% with a median ICU length of stay of 16 days (range 1 to 142 days). PCT levels were higher in non-survivors than in survivors. Initial and maximum PCT levels correlated with maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score r(2 )= 0.50 (95% CI: 0.38 to 0.61) and r(2 )= 0.57 (0.46 to 0.66), respectively.

The optimal cut-off to predict mortality for initial PCT was 1.1 ng/ml (odds ratio: OD 7.0 (95% CI 2.6 to 25.2)) and that for maximum PCT was 7.8 ng/ml (odds ratio 5.7 (95% CI 2.5 to 13.1)).

METHODS: From July 1, 2009, to January 31, 2010, we collected epidemiological and clinical data of all proven (positive H1N1v PCR) and probable (positive influenza A antigen or culture) pediatric cases of influenza A/H1N1v infections, hospitalized in four tertiary centers. RESULTS: During the epidemic period, an excess of 18% of pediatric outpatients and emergency department visits was registered. 215 children were hospitalized with proven/probable influenza A/H1N1v infection. Median age was 31 months. 47% had \u2265 1 comorbid conditions. Febrile respiratory illness was the most common presentation. 36% presented with initial gastrointestinal symptoms and 10% with neurological manifestations. 34% had pneumonia. Only 24% of the patients received oseltamivir but 57% received antibiotics. 10% of children were admitted to PICU, seven of whom with ARDS. Case fatality-rate was 5/215 (2%), concerning only children suffering from chronic neurological disorders. Children over 2 years of age showed a higher propensity to be admitted to PICU (16% vs 1%, p = 0.002) and a higher mortality rate (4% vs 0%, p = 0.06). Infants less than 3 months old showed a milder course of infection, with few respiratory and neurological complications. CONCLUSION: Although influenza A/H1N1v infections were generally self-limited, pediatric burden of disease was significant.

However, encouraging physicians to put the results of new studies into practice is not always simple. A roundtable was thus convened to provide guidance for clinicians on the integration and implementation of new interventions into the intensive care unit (ICU). Five topics were selected that have been shown in randomized, controlled trials to reduce mortality: limiting the tidal volume in acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, early goal-directed therapy, use of drotrecogin alfa (activated), use of moderate doses of steroids, and tight control of blood sugar. One of the principal investigators for each study was invited to participate in the roundtable. The discussions and questions that followed the presentation of data by each panel member enabled a consensus recommendation to be derived regarding when each intervention should be used. Each new intervention has a place in the management of patients with sepsis. Furthermore, and importantly, the therapies are not mutually exclusive; many patients will need a combination of several approaches \u2013 an \u0027ICU package\u0027. The present article provides guidelines from experts in the field on optimal patient selection and timing for each intervention, and provides advice on how to integrate new therapies into ICU practice, including protocol development, so that mortality rates from this disease process can be reduced.","publish_time":"2002-12-05T00:00:00Z","authors":"Vincent, Jean-Louis; Abraham, Edward; Annane, Djillali; Bernard, Gordon; Rivers, Emanuel; Van den Berghe, Greet","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/af46b5d09c9e8b938410ad5a3406bb6a7fc90cf9.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3239386.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3239386/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE0OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["new therapies","ICU practice","implementation of new interventions","mortality rates","results of new studies","ICU package","sepsis","roundtable","development of therapeutic interventions","protocol development","management of patients","acute lung injury","acute respiratory distress syndrome","experts","field","early goal","tidal volume","optimal patient selection","intensive care unit","panel member","therapy","timing","integration","presentation of data","tight control of blood sugar","guidelines","moderate doses of steroids","years","place","questions","consensus recommendation","present article","clinicians","guidance","past","approaches","controlled trials","disease process","advice","principal investigators","study","drotrecogin alfa","discussions","combination","physicians","Considerable progress","topics"],"language":"en"},

A correlation between the mechanical strength of mRNA pseudoknots and frameshifting efficiency has previously been found; however, the physical mechanism behind frameshifting still remains to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized synthetic sequences predicted to form mRNA pseudoknot-like structures. Surprisingly, the structures predicted to be strongest lead only to limited frameshifting. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins revealed that a significant fraction of the ribosomes were frameshifted but unable to pass the pseudoknot-like structures. Hence, pseudoknots can act as ribosomal roadblocks, prohibiting a significant fraction of the frameshifted ribosomes from reaching the downstream stop codon. The stronger the pseudoknot the larger the frameshifting efficiency and the larger its roadblocking effect. The maximal amount of full-length frameshifted product is produced from a structure where those two effects are balanced. Taking ribosomal roadblocking into account is a prerequisite for formulating correct frameshifting hypotheses.","publish_time":"2011-09-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Tholstrup, Jesper; Oddershede, Lene B.; S\u00F8rensen, Michael A.","journal":"Nucleic Acids Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/721b3e6ae8af24a4f625540bbb6e2c02fb77b491.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3245918.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245918/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE1OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["frameshifting efficiency","programmed ribosomal frameshifting","structures","correct frameshifting hypotheses","frameshifted ribosomes","ribosomal roadblocking","significant fraction","mechanical strength of mRNA pseudoknots","ribosomal roadblocks","downstream-encoded protein","full-length frameshifted product","roadblocking effect","downstream stop codon","Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins","prerequisite","defined stochiometric ratio","slippery sequence","combination","account","synthetic sequences","correlation","strongest lead","viruses","study","physical mechanism","effects"],"language":"en"},

It is a fundamentally important problem because the information thus obtained may benefit the understanding of many basic biological processes and provide useful clues for drug design. In this study, based on the information of chemical-chemical interactions, a novel method was developed that can be used to identify which of the following eleven metabolic pathway classes a query compound may be involved with: (1) Carbohydrate Metabolism, (2) Energy Metabolism, (3) Lipid Metabolism, (4) Nucleotide Metabolism, (5) Amino Acid Metabolism, (6) Metabolism of Other Amino Acids, (7) Glycan Biosynthesis and Metabolism, (8) Metabolism of Cofactors and Vitamins, (9) Metabolism of Terpenoids and Polyketides, (10) Biosynthesis of Other Secondary Metabolites, (11) Xenobiotics Biodegradation and Metabolism. It was observed that the overall success rate obtained by the method via the 5-fold cross-validation test on a benchmark dataset consisting of 3,137 compounds was 77.97%, which is much higher than 10.45%, the corresponding success rate obtained by the random guesses. Besides, to deal with the situation that some compounds may be involved with more than one metabolic pathway class, the method presented here is featured by the capacity able to provide a series of potential metabolic pathway classes ranked according to the descending order of their likelihood for each of the query compounds concerned. Furthermore, our method was also applied to predict 5,549 compounds whose metabolic pathway classes are unknown. Interestingly, the results thus obtained are quite consistent with the deductions from the reports by other investigators. It is anticipated that, with the continuous increase of the chemical-chemical interaction data, the current method will be further enhanced in its power and accuracy, so as to become a useful complementary vehicle in annotating uncharacterized compounds for their biological functions.","publish_time":"2011-12-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hu, Le-Le; Chen, Chen; Huang, Tao; Cai, Yu-Dong; Chou, Kuo-Chen","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/e344d21fb68d14bed65d7fbdc97164e61717a0f2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3248422.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3248422/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE2Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Amino Acid Metabolism"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["Energy Metabolism","Lipid Metabolism","Nucleotide Metabolism","Metabolism of Terpenoids","Metabolism of Cofactors","Carbohydrate Metabolism","Amino Acid Metabolism","query compounds","information of chemical","current method","novel method","series of potential metabolic pathway classes","chemical-chemical interaction data","chemical interactions","annotating uncharacterized compounds","biological functions","basic biological processes","corresponding success rate","overall success rate","useful clues","Amino Acids","Glycan Biosynthesis","useful complementary vehicle","fold cross-validation test","benchmark dataset","understanding","likelihood","Secondary Metabolites","drug design","random guesses","descending order","Xenobiotics Biodegradation","continuous increase","deductions","reports","Polyketides","Vitamins","capacity able","investigators","important problem","power","accuracy","results","study","situation"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on 231 treatment naive patients with a single HCC \u2264 3 cm who had received either curative PRFA (162 patients) or curative SR (69 patients). All patients were regularly followed up after treatment at our department with blood and radiologic tests. RESULTS: The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates after PRFA and SR were 95.4%, 79.6% and 63.1%, respectively in the PRFA group and 100%, 81.4% and 74.6%, respectively in the SR group. The corresponding recurrence free survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years after PRFA and SR were 82.0%, 38.3% and 18.0%, respectively in the PRFA group and 86.0%, 47.2% and 26.0%, respectively in the SR group. In terms of overall survival and recurrence free survival, there were no significant differences between these two groups. In comparison of PRFA group patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) (n = 127) and SR group patients with LC (n = 50) and in comparison of PRFA group patients without LC (n = 35) and SR group patients without LC (n = 19), there were also no significant differences between two groups in terms of overall survival and recurrence free survival. In the multivariate analysis of the risk factors contributing to overall survival, serum albumin level was the sole significant factor. In the multivariate analysis of the risk factors contributing to recurrence free survival, presence of LC was the sole significant factor. The rate of serious adverse events in the SR group was significantly higher than that in the PRFA group (P = 0.023). Hospitalization length in the SR group was significantly longer than in the PRFA group (P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: PRFA is as effective as SR in the treatment of single and small HCC, and is less invasive than SR. Therefore, PRFA could be a first choice for the treatment of single and small HCC.","publish_time":"2011-12-28T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nishikawa, Hiroki; Inuzuka, Tadashi; Takeda, Haruhiko; Nakajima, Jun; Matsuda, Fumihiro; Sakamoto, Azusa; Henmi, Shinichiro; Hatamaru, Keiichi; Ishikawa, Tetsuro; Saito, Sumio; Nasu, Akihiro; Kita, Ryuichi; Kimura, Toru; Arimoto, Akira; Osaki, Yukio","journal":"BMC Gastroenterol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/c18255847a0b4f89e12a7fce7a0c731d43ff1850.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3260104.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260104/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzE3OA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PRFA"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SR group patients","comparison of PRFA group patients","curative PRFA","curative SR","terms of overall survival","treatment naive patients","treatment of single","single HCC","corresponding recurrence free survival rates","year overall survival rates","small HCC","presence of LC","significant differences","sole significant factor","risk factors","groups","multivariate analysis","small hepatocellular carcinoma","serum albumin level","outcome of percutaneous radiofrequency thermal ablation therapy","liver cirrhosis","retrospective cohort study","surgical resection","rate of serious adverse events","department","blood","years","investigation","radiologic tests","Hospitalization length","choice","BACKGROUND","purpose","METHODS","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS"],"language":"en"},

Here, we report the collaborative application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations to characterize the 12 nt ssRNA tail derived from the prequeuosine riboswitch. NMR carbon spin relaxation data and residual dipolar coupling measurements reveal a flexible yet stacked core adopting an A-form-like conformation, with the level of order decreasing toward the terminal ends. An A-to-C mutation within the polyadenine tract alters the observed dynamics consistent with the introduction of a dynamic kink. Pre-ordering of the tail may increase the efficacy of ligand binding above that achieved by a random-coil ssRNA. The REMD simulations recapitulate important trends in the NMR data, but suggest more internal motions than inferred from the NMR analysis.

We utilized a barcoding strategy to simultaneously deep sequence multiple serum specimens, generating on average over 1 million reads per sample.

In this paper, we show that an essential translation factor, Ded1p DEAD-box RNA helicase of yeast, directly affects replication of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV). To separate the role of Ded1p in viral protein translation from its putative replication function, we utilized a cell-free TBSV replication assay and recombinant Ded1p. The in vitro data show that Ded1p plays a role in enhancing plus-strand synthesis by the viral replicase. We also find that Ded1p is a component of the tombusvirus replicase complex and Ded1p binds to the 3\u2032-end of the viral minus-stranded RNA. The data obtained with wt and ATPase deficient Ded1p mutants support the model that Ded1p unwinds local structures at the 3\u2032-end of the TBSV (\u2212)RNA, rendering the RNA compatible for initiation of (\u002B)-strand synthesis. Interestingly, we find that Ded1p and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is another host factor for TBSV, play non-overlapping functions to enhance (\u002B)-strand synthesis. Altogether, the two host factors enhance TBSV replication synergistically by interacting with the viral (\u2212)RNA and the replication proteins. In addition, we have developed an in vitro assay for Flock house virus (FHV), a small RNA virus of insects, that also demonstrated positive effect on FHV replicase activity by the added Ded1p helicase. Thus, two small RNA viruses, which do not code for their own helicases, seems to recruit a host RNA helicase to aid their replication in infected cells.","publish_time":"2012-02-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Kovalev, Nikolay; Pogany, Judit; Nagy, Peter D.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/412833ef524797198177f582425f82e45c0f7a06.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3280988.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3280988/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzIwNA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["TBSV","FHV"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["role of Ded1p","recombinant Ded1p","host RNA helicase","RNA compatible","strand RNA viruses","added Ded1p helicase","replication proteins","small RNA viruses","Ded1p DEAD-box RNA helicase of yeast","small RNA virus of insects","viral minus-stranded RNA","viral replicase","strand synthesis","cell-free TBSV replication assay","putative replication function","ATPase deficient Ded1p mutants","replication of Tomato bushy stunt virus","viral protein translation","recruited host factors","FHV replicase activity","data","end","essential translation factor","tombusvirus replicase complex","Flock house virus","model","positive effect","wt","critical steps","non-overlapping functions","component","phosphate dehydrogenase","local structures","GAPDH","glyceraldehyde","code","initiation","infected cells","helicases","paper","addition"],"language":"en"},

In contrast to mosquito-borne flaviviruses where recombination events are frequent, the evolutionary dynamic within the MTBFG was believed to be essentially clonal. This assumption was challenged with the recent report of several homologous recombinations within the Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). We performed a thorough analysis of publicly available genomes in this group and found no compelling evidence for the previously identified recombinations.

Putative parents, recombinant strains and breakpoints were further tested for statistical significance using phylogenetic methods. We investigated the time of divergence between the recombinant and parental strains in a Bayesian framework. The recombination was estimated to have occurred during a window of 282 to 76 years before the present. By unravelling the temporal setting of the event, we adduce hypotheses about the ecological conditions that could account for the observed recombination.","publish_time":"2012-02-22T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bertrand, Yann; T\u00F6pel, Mats; Elv\u00E4ng, Annelie; Melik, Wessam; Johansson, Magnus","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b1d4318370f0bf32b2c6afded3ef07c1a37abe7a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3285191.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3285191/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEuY3N2OzIxMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1784377,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:44Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"g/vkYOtWNAkjBx6gYxe/pg==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_1.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MTBFG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["MTBFG","recombination events","demonstrable recombination","observed recombination","recombinant strains","Tick-borne encephalitis virus","homologous recombinations","parental strains","statistical significance","mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group","identified recombinations","phylogenetic methods","time of divergence","large statistical support","strong phylogenetic evidences","Louping ill virus lineage","animal diseases","breakpoints","important human","flaviviruses","evolutionary dynamic","available genomes","recent report","mosquito","compelling evidence","Putative parents","hemorrhagic fever","Bayesian framework","hypotheses","thorough analysis","TBEV","ecological conditions","years","temporal setting","assumption","contrast","window","results"],"language":"en"},

The disease is increasing in livestock worldwide and is a re-emerging human disease. There are currently no commercial vaccines, and only one drug with significant efficacy against adult worms and juveniles. A liver fluke vaccine is deemed essential as short-lived chemotherapy, which is prone to resistance, is an unsustainable option in both developed and developing countries. Protein superfamilies have provided a number of leading liver fluke vaccine candidates. A new form of glutathione transferase (GST) family, Sigma class GST, closely related to a leading Schistosome vaccine candidate (Sm28), has previously been revealed by proteomics in the liver fluke but not functionally characterised. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this manuscript we show that a purified recombinant form of the F. hepatica Sigma class GST possesses prostaglandin synthase activity and influences activity of host immune cells. Immunocytochemistry and western blotting have shown the protein is present near the surface of the fluke and expressed in eggs and newly excysted juveniles, and present in the excretory/secretory fraction of adults. We have assessed the potential to use F. hepatica Sigma class GST as a vaccine in a goat-based vaccine trial. No significant reduction of worm burden was found but we show significant reduction in the pathology normally associated with liver fluke infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown that F. hepatica Sigma class GST has likely multi-functional roles in the host-parasite interaction from general detoxification and bile acid sequestration to PGD synthase activity.","publish_time":"2012-05-29T00:00:00Z","authors":"LaCourse, E.

Among them, activated neutrophil- (PMN-) induced tissue injury and epithelial cell apoptosis mediated lung damage represent two potentially important candidate pathomechanisms that have been put forward. Several approaches have been undertaken to test these hypotheses, with substantial success in the treatment of experimental forms of ALI. With this in mind, we will summarize these two current hypotheses of ALI briefly, emphasizing the role of apoptosis in regulating PMN and/or lung epithelial cell responses.

All this just to construct the model, then it still has to be simulated and analyzed under different epidemiological scenarios.

In this paper, we present a simulation software, Epigrass, aimed to help designing and simulating network-epidemic models with any kind of node behavior. RESULTS: A Network epidemiological model representing the spread of a directly transmitted disease through a bus-transportation network connecting mid-size cities in Brazil. Results show that the topological context of the starting point of the epidemic is of great importance from both control and preventive perspectives.

The outcomes of HSES patients are often fatal or manifesting severe neurological sequelae. We reviewed the markers for an early diagnosis of HSES. METHODS: We examined the clinical, biological and radiological findings of 8 patients (4 months to 9 years old) who met the HSES criteria. RESULTS: Although cerebral edema, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and multiple organ failure were seen in all 8 cases during their clinical courses, brain computed tomography (CT) scans showed normal or only slight edema in 5 patients upon admission. All 8 patients had normal platelet counts, and none were in shock. However, they all had severe metabolic acidosis, which persisted even after 3 hours (median base excess (BE), -7.6 mmol/L). And at 6 hours after admission (BE, -5.7 mmol/L) they required mechanical ventilation. Within 12 hours after admission, fluid resuscitation and vasopressor infusion for hypotension was required. Seven of the patients had elevated liver enzymes and creatine kinase (CK) upon admission. Twenty-four hours after admission, all 8 patients needed vasopressor infusion to maintain blood pressure. CONCLUSION: CT scan, platelet count, hemoglobin level and renal function upon admission are not useful for an early diagnosis of HSES. However, the elevated liver enzymes and CK upon admission, hypotension in the early stage after admission with refractory acid-base disturbance to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor infusion are useful markers for an early HSES diagnosis and helpful to indicate starting intensive neurological treatment.","publish_time":"2008-10-16T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rinka, Hiroshi; Yoshida, Takeshi; Kubota, Tetsushi; Tsuruwa, Miho; Fuke, Akihiro; Yoshimoto, Akira; Kan, Masanori; Miyazaki, Dai; Arimoto, Hideki; Miyaichi, Toshinori; Kaji, Arito; Miyamoto, Satoru; Kuki, Ichiro; Shiomi, Masashi","journal":"BMC Pediatr","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/57383b80a4a1b97a7d3cf130525117d08e07c919.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2577649.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2577649/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzU4NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["HSES"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["admission","early diagnosis of HSES","early HSES diagnosis","outcomes of HSES patients","hours","HSES criteria","vasopressor infusion","early stage","fluid resuscitation","useful markers","elevated liver enzymes","hypotension","mmol","normal platelet counts","CT scan","slight edema","cerebral edema","clinical courses","manifesting severe neurological sequelae","hemorrhagic shock","median base excess","severe metabolic acidosis","refractory acid-base disturbance","starting intensive neurological treatment","hemoglobin level","renal function","creatine kinase","DIC","brain","tomography","scans","encephalopathy syndrome","intravascular coagulopathy","devastating disease","radiological findings","cases","CONCLUSION","months","years old","multiple organ failure","blood pressure","young children","BACKGROUND","RESULTS","mechanical ventilation","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

The complete genome sequence of L. hongkongensis HLHK9, recovered from an immunocompetent patient with severe gastroenteritis, consists of a 3,169-kb chromosome with G\u002BC content of 62.35%. Genome analysis reveals different mechanisms potentially important for its adaptation to diverse habitats of human and freshwater fish intestines and freshwater environments. The gene contents support its phenotypic properties and suggest that amino acids and fatty acids can be used as carbon sources. The extensive variety of transporters, including multidrug efflux and heavy metal transporters as well as genes involved in chemotaxis, may enable L. hongkongensis to survive in different environmental niches. Genes encoding urease, bile salts efflux pump, adhesin, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and other putative virulence factors\u2014such as hemolysins, RTX toxins, patatin-like proteins, phospholipase A1, and collagenases\u2014are present. Proteomes of L. hongkongensis HLHK9 cultured at 37\u00B0C (human body temperature) and 20\u00B0C (freshwater habitat temperature) showed differential gene expression, including two homologous copies of argB, argB-20, and argB-37, which encode two isoenzymes of N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (NAGK)\u2014NAGK-20 and NAGK-37\u2014in the arginine biosynthesis pathway. NAGK-20 showed higher expression at 20\u00B0C, whereas NAGK-37 showed higher expression at 37\u00B0C. NAGK-20 also had a lower optimal temperature for enzymatic activities and was inhibited by arginine probably as negative-feedback control. Similar duplicated copies of argB are also observed in bacteria from hot springs such as Thermus thermophilus, Deinococcus geothermalis, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Roseiflexus castenholzii, suggesting that similar mechanisms for temperature adaptation may be employed by other bacteria.

The translation of therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma from the experimental phase into the clinic has been limited by insufficient animal models, which lack important features of human tumors. Lentiviral gene therapy is an attractive therapeutic option for human glioblastoma, which we validated in a clinically relevant animal model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a rodent xenograft model that recapitulates the invasive and angiogenic features of human glioblastoma to analyze the transduction pattern and therapeutic efficacy of lentiviral pseudotyped vectors. Both, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein (LCMV-GP) and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviral vectors very efficiently transduced human glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, pseudotyped gammaretroviral vectors, similar to those evaluated for clinical therapy of glioblastoma, showed inefficient gene transfer in vitro and in vivo. Both pseudotyped lentiviral vectors transduced cancer stem-like cells characterized by their CD133-, nestin- and SOX2-expression, the ability to form spheroids in neural stem cell medium and to express astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers under serum conditions. In a therapeutic approach using the suicide gene herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-1-tk) fused to eGFP, both lentiviral vectors mediated a complete remission of solid tumors as seen on MRI resulting in a highly significant survival benefit (p\u003C0.001) compared to control groups. In all recurrent tumors, surviving eGFP-positive tumor cells were found, advocating prodrug application for several cycles to even enhance and prolong the therapeutic effect. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, lentiviral pseudotyped vectors are promising candidates for gene therapy of glioma in patients. The inefficient gene delivery by gammaretroviral vectors is in line with the results obtained in clinical therapy for GBM and thus confirms the high reproducibility of the invasive glioma animal model for translational research.","publish_time":"2009-07-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Huszthy, Peter C.; Giroglou, Tsanan; Tsinkalovsky, Oleg; Euskirchen, Philipp; Skaftnesmo, Kai Ove; Bjerkvig, Rolf; von Laer, Dorothee; Miletic, Hrvoje","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/63205fe99a388f19fde06f422c9ce6c1ddfc52f4.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2707627.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2707627/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY0NA2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["pseudotyped lentiviral vectors","Lentiviral gene therapy","therapeutic efficacy of lentiviral pseudotyped vectors","pseudotyped gammaretroviral vectors","human glioblastoma cells","clinical therapy of glioblastoma","gene therapy of glioma","angiogenic features of human glioblastoma","therapeutic approach","therapeutic effect","inefficient gene delivery","inefficient gene transfer","invasive glioma animal model","important features of human tumors","attractive therapeutic option","translation of therapeutic strategies","relevant animal model","eGFP-positive tumor cells","recurrent tumors","suicide gene herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase","vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein","lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein","insufficient animal models","rodent xenograft model","cancer stem","complete remission of solid tumors","malignant primary brain tumor","neural stem cell medium","LCMV-GP","promising candidates","VSV-G","transduction pattern","spheroids","HSV","neuronal differentiation markers","high reproducibility","ability","GBM","line","translational research","results","serum conditions","poor prognosis","experimental phase","SOX2-expression","MRI","SIGNIFICANCE","contrast","significant survival benefit","PRINCIPAL FINDINGS","prodrug application","nestin","tk","CD133","patients","METHODOLOGY","cycles","CONCLUSIONS","BACKGROUND","control groups"],"language":"en"},

Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.","publish_time":"2009-09-25T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lemey, Philippe; Rambaut, Andrew; Drummond, Alexei J.; Suchard, Marc A.","journal":"PLoS Comput Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f06b500cbbffe7641b716dbbb90f0d40ed7839d6.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2740835.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2740835/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY4OQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Standard Markov"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["spatial dynamics","Bayesian software","epidemic dynamics","Bayesian framework","inference of historical dispersal","Bayesian phylogeography","phylogeographic framework","Standard Markov model inference","geographical sampling distributions","migration patterns of viruses","geographical distribution of viruses","H5N1 origin","virus diffusion","endemic maintenance","Analysis of rabies","sampling localities","diffusion process","temporal setting","temporal information","genetic data","genetic histories","reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns","H5N1 epidemiological linkage","previous parsimony analysis","continuous epidemic cycles","virtual globe software","model-free heuristic approaches","hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history","visualization","West African dog populations","little insight","investigation","influenza","alternative hypotheses","stochastic search variable selection procedure","parsimonious descriptions","samples time-scaled phylogenies","important asset","inferences","phylogenetic uncertainty","priors","key factor","introduction of probabilistic models of evolution","unique opportunities","character mapping","molecular epidemiology","biogeogeography","organisms","statistical endeavor","light","addition","analyses"],"language":"en"},

Thus, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of Nab during the early stages of natural infection could prove useful in achieving this goal. Here we demonstrate that viral escape readily occurred despite the development of high titer autologous Nab in two subjects with acute/early subtype C infection. To provide a detailed portrayal of the escape pathways, Nab resistant variants identified at multiple time points were used to create a series of envelope (Env) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants within the background of a corresponding newly transmitted Env. In one subject, Nab escape was driven predominantly by changes in the region of gp120 that extends from the beginning of the V3 domain to the end of the V5 domain (V3V5). However, Nab escape pathways in this subject oscillated and at times required cooperation between V1V2 and the gp41 ectodomain. In the second subject, escape was driven by changes in V1V2. This V1V2-dependent escape pathway was retained over time, and its utility was reflected in the virus\u0027s ability to escape from two distinct monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) derived from this same patient via introduction of a single potential N-linked glycosylation site in V2. Spatial representation of the sequence changes in gp120 suggested that selective pressure acted upon the same regions of Env in these two subjects, even though the Env domains that drove escape were different. Together the findings argue that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in early subtype C HIV-1 infection, and support a model in which multiple strategies, including potential glycan shifts, direct alteration of an epitope sequence, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.","publish_time":"2009-09-18T00:00:00Z","authors":"Rong, Rong; Li, Bing; Lynch, Rebecca M.; Haaland, Richard E.; Murphy, Megan K.; Mulenga, Joseph; Allen, Susan A.; Pinter, Abraham; Shaw, George M.; Hunter, Eric; Robinson, James E.; Gnanakaran, S.; Derdeyn, Cynthia A.","journal":"PLoS Pathog","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b7e7ff011d768680bee745105bd24389068a5a1f.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2741593.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741593/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzY5MQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["escape pathways","viral escape","V1V2-dependent escape pathway","regions of Env","Env domains","transmitted Env","early subtype C infection","sequence changes","new infection","early subtype C HIV","early stages of natural infection","cooperative Env domain conformational masking","subjects","V5 domain","V3 domain","single mutational pathway","multiple time points","epitope sequence","multiple strategies","HIV vaccine","region of gp120","neutralizing antibodies","potential glycan shifts","single potential N-linked glycosylation site","distinct monoclonal antibodies","background","direct alteration","cooperation","resistant variants","glycoprotein chimeras","mutants","development of high titer autologous","selective pressure","Mabs","establishment","patient","introduction","series of envelope","times","diverse viruses","virus\u0027s ability","Spatial representation","utility","weaknesses","gp41 ectodomain","V3V5","findings","beginning","model","detailed portrayal","replication","aim","strengths","goal","neutralization"],"language":"en"},

Little is known about how to deal with deterioration of human resources in the health care systems. This study aimed to predict the intention to provide surgical treatment to HIV infected patients among medical- and dental students in Tanzania and Sudan using an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). METHODS: Four hundred and seventy five medical- and dental students at the University of Dar es Salaam (mean age, 25 yr) and 642 dental students attending 6 public and private dental faculties in Khartoum (mean age 21.7 yr) completed self-administered TPB questionnaires in 2005 and 2007, respectively. RESULTS: Both Tanzanian and Sudanese students demonstrated strong intentions to provide care for people with HIV and AIDS. Stepwise linear regression revealed that the TPB accounted for 51% (43% in Tanzania and Sudan) of the variance in intention across study sites. After having controlled for country and past behaviour, the TPB in terms of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control accounted for 34% and moral norms for an additional 2,3% of the explainable variance in intention. Across both study sites, attitudes were the strongest predictor of intention followed in descending order by subjective norms, moral norms and perceived behavioural control. CONCLUSION: The TPB is applicable to students\u0027 care delivery intentions in the context of HIV and AIDS across the two SSA countries investigated. It is suggested that attitudes, subjective norms, moral norms and perceived behavioural control are key factors in students\u0027 willingness to treat AIDS and HIV infected patients and should be targets of interventions aimed at improving the quality of health care delivery in this context.","publish_time":"2009-11-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"\u00C5str\u00F8m, Anne N; Nasir, Elwalid F","journal":"BMC Health Serv Res","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/942cf15876c6cc4b6e56a538c5e4faff4201430b.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2784770.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2784770/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2OzcyMQ2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["University of Dar es Salaam","TPB","SSA"],"locations":["sub Saharan Africa","Khartoum","Tanzania","Sudan"],"keyphrases":["subjective norms","moral norms","dental students","context of HIV","perceived behavioural control","health care workers","health care systems","HIV infected patients","HIV epidemic","AIDS","students\u0027 care delivery intentions","quality of health care delivery","Sudanese students","study sites","self-administered TPB questionnaires","mean age","private dental faculties","yr","terms of attitudes","SSA countries","strongest predictor of intention","Tanzania","students\u0027 willingness","strong intentions","past behaviour","explainable variance","low income countries","Theory of Planned Behaviour","Khartoum","key factors","descending order","significant challenges","University of Dar es Salaam","sub Saharan Africa","extended version","surgical treatment","level of motivation","attrition rate","people","deterioration of human resources","absenteeism","RESULTS","Stepwise linear regression","BACKGROUND","country","interventions","CONCLUSION","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

To combat against this pathogen, immune cells release cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1 (TNF-\u03B1), which is pivotal in the development of protective granulomas. Our previous results showed that Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), a mycobacterium used as a model to investigate the immune response against MTB, stimulates the induction of TNF-\u03B1 via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in human blood monocytes. Since MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is known to regulate MAPK activities, we examined whether MKP-1 plays a role in BCG-induced MAPK activation and cytokine expression. RESULTS: Primary human blood monocytes were treated with BCG and assayed for MKP-1 expression. Our results demonstrated that following exposure to BCG, there was an increase in the expression of MKP-1. Additionally, the induction of MKP-1 was regulated by p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Surprisingly, when MKP-1 expression was blocked by its specific siRNA, there was a significant decrease in the levels of phospho-MAPK (p38 MAPK and ERK1/2) and TNF-\u03B1 inducible by BCG. CONCLUSIONS: Since TNF-\u03B1 is pivotal in granuloma formation, the results indicated an unexpected positive function of MKP-1 against mycobacterial infection as opposed to its usual phosphatase activity.","publish_time":"2009-12-17T00:00:00Z","authors":"Cheung, Benny KW; Yim, Howard CH; Lee, Norris CM; Lau, Allan SY","journal":"BMC Immunol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/f6ed1f1e9999e57793addb1c9c54f61c7861a995.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2804704.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804704/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc0Mw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["MTB","MAPK","BCG"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["expression of MKP","p38 MAPK","MAPK phosphatase","induction of MKP","MAPK activities","BCG-induced MAPK activation","TNF-\u03B1 inducible","induction of TNF","previous results","unexpected positive function of MKP","cytokine expression","tumor necrosis factor-\u03B1","MTB","ERK1","Primary human blood monocytes","immune cells","extracellular signal-regulated kinase","immune response","Mycobacterium tuberculosis","usual phosphatase activity","mitogen-activated protein kinase","cytokines","levels of phospho","Bacillus Calmette Guerin","granuloma formation","role","significant decrease","major cause of morbidity","mortality","mycobacterial infection","specific siRNA","development of protective granulomas","pathogen","model","BACKGROUND","following exposure","increase","world","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

However, some countries still restrict the entrance and/or residency of foreigners with an HIV infection. HIV-related travel restrictions have serious implications for individual and public health, and violate internationally recognized human rights. In this study, we reviewed the current situation regarding HIV-related travel restrictions in the 53 countries of the WHO European Region. METHODS: We retrieved the country-specific information chiefly from the Global Database on HIV Related Travel Restrictions at hivtravel.org. We simplified and standardized the database information to enable us to create an overview and compare countries. Where data was outdated, unclear or contradictory, we contacted WHO HIV focal points in the countries or appropriate non-governmental organizations. The United States Bureau of Consular Affairs website was also used to confirm and complement these data. RESULTS: Our review revealed that there are no entry restrictions for people living with HIV in 51 countries in the WHO European Region. In 11 countries, foreigners living with HIV applying for long-term stays will not be granted a visa. These countries are: Andorra, Armenia, Cyprus (denies access for non-European Union citizens), Hungary, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. In Uzbekistan, an HIV-positive foreigner cannot even enter the country, and in Georgia, we were not able to determine whether there were any HIV-related travel restrictions due to a lack of information. CONCLUSIONS: In 32% of the countries in the European Region, either there are some kind of HIV-related travel restrictions or we were unable to determine if such restrictions are in force. Most of these countries defend restrictions as being justified by public health concerns. However, there is no evidence that denying HIV-positive foreigners access to a country is effective in protecting public health. Governments should revise legislation on HIV-related travel restrictions. In the meantime, a joint effort is needed to draw attention to the continuing discrimination and stigmatization of people living with HIV that takes place in those European Region countries where such laws and policies are still in force.","publish_time":"2010-01-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Lazarus, Jeffrey V; Curth, Nadja; Weait, Matthew; Matic, Srdan","journal":"J Int AIDS Soc","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a512aee454d1c6a68b554f4eb2a590c2058380e8.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2823611.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2823611/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc2Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["World Health Organization","WHO European Region","Global Database","hivtravel.org","United States Bureau of Consular Affairs"],"locations":["Armenia","Hungary","Kazakhstan","Moldova","Georgia"],"keyphrases":["HIV-related travel restrictions","HIV Related Travel Restrictions","kind of HIV","spread of HIV","HIV infection","European Region countries","HIV focal points","HIV-positive foreigners access","entry restrictions","public health concerns","database information","country-specific information","non-European Union citizens","residency of foreigners","Uzbekistan","World Health Organization","lack of information","force","Global Database","stigmatization of people","appropriate non-governmental organizations","serious implications","Kazakhstan","Tajikistan","Hungary","Russian Federation","current situation","attention","United States Bureau of Consular Affairs website","Moldova","Turkmenistan","ineffective way","Cyprus","laws","legislation","place","Ukraine","continuing discrimination","Armenia","policies","screening of international travellers","joint effort","Andorra","long-term stays","entrance","evidence","meantime","review","study","Georgia","Governments","human rights","RESULTS","visa","METHODS","overview","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS"],"language":"en"},

We aimed to compare the risk of influenza infection in healthcare workers in acute hospital care with that in non-healthcare workers over the same season. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicentre cohort study during the 2006/07 influenza season in Berlin, Germany. Recruited participants gave serum samples before and after the season, and completed questionnaires to determine their relevant exposures and possible confounding factors. The main outcome measure was serologically confirmed influenza infection (SCII), defined as a fourfold or greater rise in haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres to a circulating strain of influenza (with post-season titre at least 1:40). Weekly mobile phone text messages were used to prompt participants to report respiratory illnesses during the influenza season. A logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of potential risk factors. RESULTS: We recruited 250 hospital healthcare workers (mean age 35.7 years) and 486 non-healthcare workers (mean age 39.2 years) from administrative centres, blood donors and colleges. Overall SCII attack rate was 10.6%. Being a healthcare worker was not a risk factor for SCII (relative risk 1.1, p = 0.70). The final multivariate model had three significant factors: living with children (odds ratio [OR] 3.7, p = 0.005), immunization (OR 0.50, p = 0.02), and - among persons living in households without children - ownership of a car (OR 3.0, p = 0.02). Living with three or more children (OR 13.8, p \u003C 0.01) was a greater risk than living with one or two children (OR 5.3, p = 0.02). 30% of participants with SCII reported no respiratory illness. Healthcare workers were at slightly higher risk of reporting any respiratory infection than controls (adjusted OR 1.3, p = 0.04, n = 850). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that healthcare workers in hospitals do not have a higher risk of influenza than non-healthcare workers, although their risk of any respiratory infection is slightly raised. Household contacts seem to be more important than exposure to patients. Car ownership is a surprise finding which needs further exploration. Asymptomatic infections are common, accounting for around a third of serologically confirmed infections.","publish_time":"2010-01-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Williams, Chris J; Schweiger, Brunhilde; Diner, Genia; Gerlach, Frank; Haaman, Frank; Krause, G\u00E9rard; Nienhaus, Albert; Buchholz, Udo","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/0004456994f6c1d5db7327990386d33c01cff32a.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2836320.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836320/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozc3Ng2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SCII","Healthcare"],"locations":["Berlin","Germany"],"keyphrases":["risk of influenza infection","non-healthcare workers","higher risk of influenza","hospital healthcare workers","influenza season","greater risk","relative risk","confirmed influenza infection","Influenza immunisation","perceived higher risk","respiratory infection","influence of potential risk factors","circulating strain of influenza","participants","children - ownership","respiratory illnesses","years","mean age","significant factors","RESULTS","confirmed infections","Car ownership","Overall SCII attack rate","possible confounding factors","greater rise","Asymptomatic infections","vulnerable patients","acute hospital care","final multivariate model","logistic regression model","haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres","administrative centres","relevant exposures","hospitals","multicentre cohort study","blood donors","main outcome measure","Weekly mobile phone text messages","colleges","BACKGROUND","post-season titre","accounting","surprise","questionnaires","households","serum samples","odds ratio","Berlin","Germany","controls","Household contacts","persons","CONCLUSIONS","immunization","exploration","METHODS"],"language":"en"},

We focus especially on viruses with RNA genomes due to their importance in the evolution of emerging diseases and as model systems to test robustness theory. We present new data on adaptive constraints for a model RNA virus challenged to evolve in response to UV radiation. We also draw attention to other infectious disease systems where robustness theory may prove useful for bridging evolutionary biology and biomedicine, especially the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, immune evasion by influenza, and malaria parasite infections.","publish_time":"2010-06-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Ogbunugafor, C.

Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of the viruses. However, little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of polioviruses genome has been acquired to date. METHODS: The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values, effective number of codon (ENC) values, nucleotide contents and dinucleotides were investigated and a comparative analysis of codon usage pattern for open reading frames (ORFs) among 48 polioviruses isolates including 31 of genotype 1, 13 of genotype 2 and 4 of genotype 3. RESULTS: The result shows that the overall extent of codon usage bias in poliovirus samples is low (mean ENC = 53.754 \u003E 40). The general correlation between base composition and codon usage bias suggests that mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in those polioviruses. Depending on the RSCU data, it was found that there was a significant variation in bias of codon usage among three genotypes. Geographic factor also has some effect on the codon usage pattern (exists in the genotype-1 of polioviruses). No significant effect in gene length or vaccine derived polioviruses (DVPVs), wild viruses and live attenuated virus was observed on the variations of synonymous codon usage in the virus genes. The relative abundance of dinucleotide (CpG) in the ORFs of polioviruses are far below expected values especially in DVPVs and attenuated virus of polioviruses genotype 1. CONCLUSION: The information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding poliovirus evolution, especially for DVPVs genotype 1, but also have potential value for the development of poliovirus vaccines.","publish_time":"2011-03-30T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Jie; Wang, Meng; Liu, Wen-qian; Zhou, Jian-hua; Chen, Hao-tai; Ma, Li-na; Ding, Yao-zhong; Gu, Yuan-xing; Liu, Yong-sheng","journal":"Virol J","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/568cf52b425ceaf8d1e9a14bbd088c493e8fd4fe.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3079669.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3079669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk4Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["RSCU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["bias of codon usage","relative synonymous codon usage","variations of synonymous codon usage","synonymous codon usage pattern of polioviruses genome","overall extent of codon usage bias","comparative analysis of codon usage pattern","ORFs of polioviruses","attenuated virus of polioviruses genotype","DVPVs genotype","effective number of codon","polioviruses isolates","values","vaccine derived polioviruses","poliovirus samples","understanding poliovirus evolution","development of poliovirus vaccines","live attenuated virus","significant effect","virus genes","wild viruses","evolving viruses","theoretical value","mean ENC","potential value","significant variation","little information","molecular evolution","main factor","RSCU data","Geographic factor","relative abundance of dinucleotide","gene length","open reading frames","base composition","dinucleotides","CpG","causative agent of poliomyelitis","result shows","nucleotide contents","general correlation","mutational pressure","member","human enterovirus","study","METHODS","family of Picornaviridae","BACKGROUND","genotypes","RESULTS","CONCLUSION","date"],"language":"en"},

Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission from vertebrates to humans, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors. Viruses can be categorized according to genotype (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA viruses). Among them, the RNA viruses exhibit particularly high mutation rates and are especially problematic for this reason. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. In this study, we sought to predict zoonotic propensity through the analysis of receptor characteristics. We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species--in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. RESULTS: We analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species and used a statistical discriminant analysis to predict the likelihood of transmission among species. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an attempt to predict zoonosis through simple computational analysis of receptor sequence differences. Our method may be useful in predicting the zoonotic potential of newly discovered viral strains.","publish_time":"2011-04-13T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bae, Se-Eun; Son, Hyeon Seok","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/01c25f9838ef8e005bf720c4f76e67a9f1038ff0.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3090355.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3090355/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzAuY3N2Ozk5Nw2","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1857839,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:47Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R3Char20iVEQaQ7dtb5g5A==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_0.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["receptor proteins","zoonotic viruses","analysis of receptor characteristics","host-cell receptor sequences","Viral zoonosis","dsRNA viruses","receptors of different species","envelope proteins","various receptors of host species","likelihood of transmission","direct transmission","simple computational analysis of receptor sequence differences","interspecies virus transmission","humans","primary vertebrate reservoir species","zoonotic potential","viral envelope protein","zoonotic propensity","study","ubiquitous cellular proteins","statistical discriminant analysis","discovered viral strains","hydrophilicity characteristics","specific amino acid sequence","binding","dsDNA","ssRNA","attempt","high mutation rates","hydrophobicity","ability","ssDNA","intermediate reservoirs","genotype","words","major barrier","similarities","environmental factors","properties","vertebrates","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSIONS","RESULTS","method","reason"],"language":"en"},

The accelerating extinction rate of plant species and its effect on ecosystem functioning is a hotly debated topic in ecological research. Most research projects concerning the relationship between species diversity and productivity have been conducted in artificial plant communities, with only a few in natural ecosystems. In this study we examined the relationship between species diversity and above\u2010ground net primary productivity (ANPP) over two consecutive growth seasons (2004 and 2005) in a semi\u2010arid steppe ecosystem of northern China, that were subjected to different land uses. 2.. Land use affected the relationship between species diversity and ANPP in this semi\u2010arid steppe ecosystem. Exclusion of grazing without or with biomass removal by mowing increased ANPP, species richness and species diversity compared with free grazing; the effect was reflected mainly as enhanced importance of the perennial forbs functional group in terms of their relative contributions to ANPP, plant cover and plant abundance. 3.. Many mechanisms regulate the relationship between species diversity and productivity. Differential effects of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning greatly complicate the analysis of such relationships. On grazing\u2010exclusion sites the relationship between ANPP and species richness can be best described as an exponential growth function (R (2) = 0\u00B799, P \u003C 0\u00B7001, n = 24); whereas on the free\u2010grazing site the relationship takes the form of exponential decay (R (2) = 0\u00B796, P \u003C 0\u00B7001, n = 24).

However, their biological roles and regulatory mechanisms in lung cancer development and progression are poorly defined. Real-time PCR or western blotting analysis was used to detect Rho GTPase-activating protein 24 (ARHGAP24), WWP2, p27, p-STAT6 and STAT6 expression levels as well as the activity of RhoA and Rac1 in lung cancer. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis. Tumor growth of lung cancer cells was measured using a nude mouse xenograft experiment model in vivo. The correlation between WWP2 and p27 was measured by co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination analysis. We found that ARHGAP24 expression was lower in lung cancer tissues collected from the The Cancer Genome Atlas and independent hospital database. Overexpression of ARHGAP24 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and the activity of RhoA and Rac1, induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle at the G(0)\u2013G(1) phase. ARHGAP24 overexpression also inhibited tumor growth in nude mice, whereas knockdown of ARHGAP24 significantly promoted cell proliferation and WWP2 expression and inhibited cell cycle arrest at G(1) phase through activating STAT6 signaling. ARHGAP24 overexpression inhibited WWP2 overexpression-induced cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and the decreased p27 expression. Moreover, WWP2 was found interacted with p27, and WWP2 overexpression promoted the ubiquitination of p27. In conclusion, our findings suggest that ARHGAP24 inhibits cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induces cell apoptosis of lung cancer via a STAT6-WWP2-p27 axis.","publish_time":"2019-08-20T00:00:00Z","authors":"Wang, Lei; Shen, Saie; Xiao, Haibo; Ding, Fangbao; Wang, Mingsong; Li, Guoqing; Hu, Fengqing","journal":"Carcinogenesis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/510efc2eb6995ecdce579ee4aef1c63feee91b23.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7197742.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197742/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszMTY1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["cell cycle progression","cell apoptosis of lung cancer","arrested cell cycle","suppressed cell proliferation","Overexpression of ARHGAP24","ARHGAP24 overexpression inhibited WWP2 overexpression-induced cell proliferation","induced cell apoptosis","WWP2 expression","ARHGAP24 expression","STAT6-WWP2","inhibited cell cycle arrest","lung cancer development","lung cancer tissues","knockdown of ARHGAP24","ubiquitination of p27","decreased p27 expression","p27 axis","activating STAT6","Tumor growth of lung cancer cells","STAT6 expression levels","Cancer Genome Atlas","p-STAT6","ubiquitination analysis","activity of RhoA","Rac1","Rho GTPase","phase","western blotting analysis","flow cytometry analysis","nude mice","nude mouse xenograft experiment model","regulatory mechanisms","initiation","independent hospital database","CCK","biological roles","co-immunoprecipitation","Real-time PCR","findings","great importance","different cancers","proteins","RhoGAPs","conclusion","correlation"],"language":"en"},

Methods and Results: Conserved regions in the haemagglutinin genes of avian influenza viruses subtype H5 served as targets for the primers and TaqMan\u2010MGB probe design. Concentrations of primers and probe were optimized to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the reactions. A plasmid containing the haemagglutinin gene was constructed and in vitro transcribed for a quantitative assay of copy numbers of the target gene. The results revealed that the optimal concentration of primers and probe was 640 and 480 nmol l(\u22121), respectively. The threshold of 100 copies of target molecules could be detected. The linear range for detection was determined as 10(2) to 10(8) molecules in reaction. Conclusions: It took less than 3 h to complete the detection from viral RNA extraction, with good sensitivity and repeatability.

However, the relative importance of the other SDD components, enteral and protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis, versus other methods of infection prevention and versus other contextual exposures cannot be resolved within individual studies. METHODS: Seven candidate generalized structural equation models founded on COGO concepts were confronted with Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter bacteremia as well as ventilator-associated pneumonia data derived from \u003E 200 infection prevention studies. The following group-level exposures were included in the models: use and mode of antibiotic prophylaxis, anti-septic and non-decontamination methods of infection prevention; proportion receiving mechanical ventilation; trauma ICU; mean length of ICU stay; and concurrency versus non-concurrency of topical antibiotic prophylaxis study control groups. RESULTS: In modeling Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter gut overgrowth as latent variables, anti-septic interventions had the strongest negative effect against Pseudomonas gut overgrowth but no intervention was significantly negative against Acinetobacter gut overgrowth. Strikingly, protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis and concurrency each have positive effects in the model, enteral antibiotic prophylaxis is neutral, and Acinetobacter bacteremia incidences are high within topical antibiotic prophylaxis studies, moreso with protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis exposure. Paradoxically, topical antibiotic prophylaxis (moreso with protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis) appears to provide the strongest summary prevention effects against overall bacteremia and overall VAP. CONCLUSIONS: Structural equation modeling of published Gram-negative bacillus infection data enables a test of the COGO concept. Paradoxically, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas bacteremia incidences are unusually high among studies of topical antibiotic prophylaxis.","publish_time":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","authors":"Hurley, James C.","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/3201dc787f05d5b0aa2df71afcbcaaf5468c1075.json; document_parses/pdf_json/dad569b483179318fc86f48bd31761cc99f29351.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7199305.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7199305/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszMzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["topical antibiotic prophylaxis studies","studies of topical antibiotic prophylaxis","mode of antibiotic prophylaxis","protocolized parenteral antibiotic prophylaxis exposure","infection prevention studies","non-concurrency of topical antibiotic prophylaxis study control groups","Acinetobacter gut overgrowth","Pseudomonas gut overgrowth","Acinetobacter bacteremia incidences","non-decontamination methods of infection prevention","Pseudomonas bacteremia incidences","control of gut overgrowth","overall bacteremia","modeling Pseudomonas","mediating prevention","strongest summary prevention effects","individual studies","Structural equation modeling of published Gram-negative bacillus infection data","moreso","structural equation models","COGO concepts","anti-septic interventions","strongest negative effect","Gram-negative bacilli","trauma ICU","positive effects","SDD components","overall VAP","contextual exposures","mean length of ICU","ventilator-associated pneumonia data","following group-level exposures","common constituent of selective digestive decontamination","proportion","mechanical ventilation","latent variables","test","key","regimens","CONCLUSIONS","candidate","relative importance","RESULTS","BACKGROUND"],"language":"en"},

Meningitis, encephalitis, and hepatic dysfunction have also been reported, particularly in severe cases with multisystem involvement. Scrub typhus has never been reported in the literature to cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) which includes cystitis and pyelonephritis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year old male presenting to the outpatient unit with fever, right flank pain, and burning micturition for three days was initially treated for UTI. However, he returned to the hospital on the fourth day of illness with persistent symptoms. He was hospitalized, with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone. Computerized tomography scan of his abdomen-pelvis showed features of acute pyelonephritis, so his antibiotics were upgraded to meropenem and teicoplanin. Despite this, the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated. Laboratory investigations showed multisystem involvement: decreasing platelets, raised creatinine, and deranged liver panel. As Kathmandu was hit by dengue epidemic during the patient\u2019s hospitalization, on the seventh day of his illness, blood samples were sent for tropical fever investigation. All tests came out negative except for scrub typhus\u2014IgM antibodies positive on rapid diagnostic test. The patient\u2019s symptoms subsided after 48 h of starting doxycycline and he became fully asymptomatic four days later. Fever did not recur even after discontinuing other IV antibiotics, favoring scrub typhus disease rather than systemic bacterial sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Scrub typhus is an emerging infectious disease of Nepal. Therefore, every unexplained fever cases (irrespective of clinical presentation) should be evaluated for potential Rickettsiosis. Moreover, for cases with acute pyelonephritis, atypical causative agents should be investigated, for example scrub typhus in this case.","publish_time":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","authors":"Bhattarai, Tulsi; Poudel, Sujan Chandra; Pokharel, Nishma; Bhattarai, Suraj","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/9817181e3f1c7e2f11e4efc1e7add7a9b35653cf.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7201669.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201669/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjszNzM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":[],"locations":["Kathmandu"],"keyphrases":["scrub typhus disease","patient\u2019s symptoms","features of acute pyelonephritis","unexplained fever cases","acute kidney injury","multisystem involvement","day of illness","tropical fever investigation","severe cases","persistent symptoms","IV antibiotics","patient\u2019s hospitalization","CASE PRESENTATION","patient\u2019s condition","days","acute respiratory distress syndrome","atypical signs","clinical presentation","atypical causative agents","emerging infectious disease of Nepal","outpatient unit","pneumonitis","IgM antibodies positive","creatinine","decreasing platelets","abdomen-pelvis","gastroenteritis","year old male presenting","right flank pain","blood samples","rapid diagnostic test","UTIs","systemic bacterial sepsis","Laboratory investigations","urinary tract infections","micturition","dengue epidemic","Computerized tomography scan","h of starting doxycycline","deranged liver panel","Meningitis","encephalitis","hepatic dysfunction","literature","cystitis","example","tests","CONCLUSIONS","Kathmandu","meropenem","teicoplanin","BACKGROUND","potential Rickettsiosis","ceftriaxone"],"language":"en"},

Vegetated sites below bird\u2010nesting cliffs are uniquely nutrient\u2010rich habitats in the otherwise nutrient\u2010poor arctic environment. Plants from six distinct vegetation zones below such a cliff at 79\u00B0 N, Svalbard, Norway, were collected for analysis under greenhouse conditions. Leaf nitrate reductase activity (NRA) was analysed in 42 species representing 25 % of the Svalbard vascular flora. The species mean NRA values ranged from 0.37 to 8.34 \u03BCmols of nitrite ions formed per gram of plant fresh weight per hour. Species in the vegetated zone growing closest to recent guano deposits had the highest NRA values, (mean = 4.47) whereas plants growing farther below the cliff had significantly lower values (mean = 0.55). A similar pattern was detected in a duplicate set of plants induced with 15 mM KNO(3); vegetation zone means for NRA ranged from 5.08 to 0.98 \u03BCmols of nitrite ions formed per gram of plant fresh weight per hour. Maximally induced species NRA values were highest in the first zones below the cliff and decreased downslope. This gradient paralleled the steep soil nitrate gradient, which decreased from 13.84 mg/l at the cliffbase to 1.03 mg/l downslope.

We used the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species and compiled data on hosts threatened by infectious disease and their parasites to better understand the role of infectious disease in contemporary host extinctions. The majority of mammal species considered threatened by parasites were either carnivores or artiodactyls, two clades that include the majority of domesticated animals. Parasites affecting host threat status were predominantly viruses and bacteria that infect a wide range of host species, including domesticated animals. Counter to our predictions, parasites transmitted by close contact were more likely to cause extinction risk than those transmitted by other routes. Mammal species threatened by parasites were not better studied for infectious diseases than other threatened mammals and did not have more parasites or differ in four key traits demonstrated to affect parasite species richness in other comparative studies. Our findings underscore the need for better information concerning the distribution and impacts of infectious diseases in populations of endangered mammals. In addition, our results suggest that evolutionary similarity to domesticated animals may be a key factor associated with parasite\u2010mediated declines; thus, efforts to limit contact between domesticated hosts and wildlife could reduce extinction risk.","publish_time":"2007-09-19T00:00:00Z","authors":"PEDERSEN, AMY B.; JONES, KATE E.; NUNN, CHARLES L.; ALTIZER, SONIA","journal":"Conserv Biol","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/560a01a5cb3635ec99b2399d076c3774f6dd9736.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202242.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202242/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0MDI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["Endangered Species"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["parasites","Endangered Species","threatened mammals","parasite species richness","domesticated hosts","majority of mammal species","majority of domesticated animals","wide range of host species","impacts of infectious diseases","role of infectious disease","wildlife","populations of endangered mammals","extinction risk","better information","host threat status","contemporary host extinctions","mediated declines","driven declines","close contact","key factor","key traits","natural populations","distribution","compiled data","bacteria","viruses","efforts","significant risks","need","clades","predictions","comparative studies","IUCN Red List","evolutionary similarity","results","findings","carnivores","artiodactyls","addition","Counter","routes"],"language":"en"},

The population-attributable fraction of patients with SARS that was associated with having the codon 54 variant was 20.1% (95% CI, 7.9%\u201332.3%) Conclusions MBL gene polymorphisms were significantly associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection; this might be explained by the reduced expression of functional MBL secondary to having the codon 54 variant","publish_time":"2005-10-15T00:00:00Z","authors":"Zhang, Hongxing; Zhou, Gangqiao; Zhi, Lianteng; Yang, Hao; Zhai, Yun; Dong, Xiaojia; Zhang, Xiumei; Gao, Xue; Zhu, Yunping; He, Fuchu","journal":"J Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/43293d890f696aec22d42015f9cd80b9ff1f3d18.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7202438.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202438/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0MTQ1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["SARS","MBL","Conclusions MBL"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["SARS-CoV infection","codon","control subjects","variant","Conclusions MBL gene polymorphisms","low expression of MBL","population-attributable fraction of patients","promoter polymorphisms","reduced expression of functional MBL secondary","BackgroundGenetic determinants of susceptibility","homogeneous population","severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","polymerase chain reaction direct sequencing ResultsOf","northern China MethodsThe frequencies","mutation","disease severity","haplotype pairs","mannose-binding lectin","odds ratio","confidence interval","carriers","total"],"language":"en"},

Tracheostomy is a common procedure with some risks, on the other hand with potential advantages over orotracheal intubation in critically ill patients. This study investigated the association of tracheostomy with health-related quality of life (HRQoL), symptoms of psychiatric disorders and return-to-work of ARDS survivors. METHODS: Data were collected in the context of the prospective observational German-wide DACAPO study. Clinical and demographic patient data and treatment characteristics were obtained from the participating intensive care units (ICU). HRQoL and return-to-work were assessed using patient-reported questionnaires 3, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge. HRQoL was measured with the Physical and Mental Component Scale of the Short-Form 12 Questionnaire (PCS-12, MCS-12). The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms (depression and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome-14. Physician-diagnosed anxiety and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder were recorded by patient self-report in the follow-up questionnaires. The associations of tracheostomy with HRQoL, psychiatric symptoms and return-to-work after 12 months were investigated by means of multivariable linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Primary 877 ARDS patients (mean \u00B1 standard deviation: 54 \u00B1 16 years, 68% male) survived and were discharged from ICU. Out of these patients, 478 (54.5%) were tracheotomised during ICU treatment. After 12 months, patient-reported outcomes could be analysed of 388 (44.2%) respondents, 205 with tracheostomy and 183 without. One year after ICU discharge, tracheostomy showed no significant association with physical or mental health-related quality of life (PCS-12: \u2212 0.73 [\u2212 3.96, 2.51]; MCS-12: \u2212 0.71 [\u2212 4.92, 3.49]), symptoms of psychiatric disorders (depression: 0.10 [\u2212 1.43, 1.64]; PTSD: 3.31 [\u2212 1.81, 8.43]; anxiety: 1.26 [0.41, 3.86]; obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder: 0.59 [0.05, 6.68]) or return-to-work (0.71 [0.31, 1.64]) in the multivariable analysis (OR [95%-CI]).

However, mechanical ventilation can be a double-edged sword: if set improperly, it can exacerbate the tissue damage caused by ARDS; this is known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). To minimize VILI, we must understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms of tissue damage at the alveolar level. In this Physiology in Medicine paper, the dynamic physiology of alveolar inflation and deflation during mechanical ventilation will be reviewed. In addition, the pathophysiologic mechanisms of VILI will be reviewed, and this knowledge will be used to suggest an optimal mechanical breath profile (MB(P): all airway pressures, volumes, flows, rates, and the duration that they are applied at both inspiration and expiration) necessary to minimize VILI. Our review suggests that the current protective ventilation strategy, known as the \u201Copen lung strategy,\u201D would be the optimal lung-protective approach. However, the viscoelastic behavior of dynamic alveolar inflation and deflation has not yet been incorporated into protective mechanical ventilation strategies. Using our knowledge of dynamic alveolar mechanics (i.e., the dynamic change in alveolar and alveolar duct size and shape during tidal ventilation) to modify the MB(P) so as to minimize VILI will reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with ARDS.","publish_time":"2017-06-01T00:00:00Z","authors":"Nieman, Gary F.; Satalin, Josh; Kollisch-Singule, Michaela; Andrews, Penny; Aiash, Hani; Habashi, Nader M.; Gatto, Louis A.","journal":"J Appl Physiol (1985)","pdf_json_files":null,"pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7203565.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7203565/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0MzA1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["ARDS","VILI"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["form of mechanical ventilation","protective mechanical ventilation strategies","dynamic physiology of alveolar inflation","alveolar level","tidal ventilation","knowledge of dynamic alveolar mechanics","ARDS","current protective ventilation strategy","pathophysiologic mechanisms of VILI","viscoelastic behavior of dynamic alveolar inflation","alveolar duct size","dynamic change","optimal mechanical breath profile","optimal lung-protective approach","deflation","MB","pathophysiologic mechanisms of tissue damage","open lung strategy","ventilator-induced lung injury","main treatment","shape","serious clinical problem","flows","airway pressures","Medicine paper","Acute respiratory distress syndrome","rates","volumes","expiration","morbidity","mortality","review","addition","double-edged sword","inspiration","duration"],"language":"en"},

Additionally, sepsis epidemiology has evolved. Early mortality has decreased, but many survivors now progress into chronic critical illness (CCI). This study sought to determine if there were significant differences in the host response and current epidemiology of surgical sepsis categorized by site of infection. STUDY DESIGN: This is a longitudinal study of surgical sepsis patients characterized by baseline predisposition, insult characteristics, serial biomarkers, hospital outcomes, and long-term outcomes. Patients were categorized into five anatomic sites of infection. RESULTS: The 316 study patients were predominantly Caucasian; half were male, with a mean age of 62 years, high comorbidity burden, and low 30-day mortality (10%). The primary sites were abdominal (44%), pulmonary (19%), skin/soft tissue (S/ST, 17%), genitourinary (GU, 12%), and vascular (7%). Most abdominal infections were present on admission and required source control. Comparatively, they had more prolonged proinflammation, immunosuppression, and persistent organ dysfunction. Their long-term outcome was poor with 37% CCI (defined as \u003E 14 in ICU with organ dysfunction), 49% poor discharge dispositions, and 30% 1-year mortality. Most pulmonary infections were hospital-acquired pneumonia. They had similar protracted proinflammation and organ dysfunction, but immunosuppression normalized. Long-term outcomes are similarly poor (54% CCI, 47% poor disposition, 32% 1-year mortality). S/ST and GU infections occurred in younger patients with fewer comorbidities, less perturbed immune responses, and faster resolution of organ dysfunction. Comparatively, S/ST had better long-term outcomes (23% CCI, 39% poor disposition, 13% 1-year mortality) and GU had the best (10% CCI, 20% poor disposition, 10% 1-year mortality). Vascular sepsis patients were older males, with more comorbidities. Proinflammation was blunted with baseline immunosuppression and organ dysfunction that persisted. They had the worst long-term outcomes (38% CCI, 67% poor disposition, 57% 1-year mortality). CONCLUSION: There are notable differences in baseline predisposition, host responses, and clinical outcomes by site of infection in surgical sepsis. While previous studies have focused on differences in hospital mortality, this study provides unique insights into the host response and long-term outcomes associated with different sites of infection.","publish_time":"2020-05-07T00:00:00Z","authors":"Stortz, Julie A.; Cox, Michael C.; Hawkins, Russell B.; Ghita, Gabriela L.; Brumback, Babette A.; Mohr, Alicia M.; Moldawer, Lyle L.; Efron, Philip A.; Brakenridge, Scott C.; Moore, Frederick A.","journal":"Crit Care","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/7f5b16f1038e2fefd12ad8dd0a5b4df27b2c6f49.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206740.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206740/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0NjI1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["GU"],"organizations":["S/ST","ICU"],"locations":[],"keyphrases":["year mortality","CCI","hospital mortality","poor disposition","hospital outcomes","study patients","worst long-term outcomes","day mortality","Early mortality","Vascular sepsis patients","clinical outcomes","longitudinal study of surgical sepsis patients","sepsis epidemiology","site of infection","persistent organ dysfunction","younger patients","baseline immunosuppression","current epidemiology of surgical sepsis","faster resolution of organ dysfunction","GU infections","STUDY DESIGN","different sites of infection","anatomic sites of infection","poor discharge dispositions","host responses","baseline predisposition","abdominal infections","pulmonary infections","notable differences","significant differences","role of site","prolonged proinflammation","primary sites","similar protracted proinflammation","fewer comorbidities","perturbed immune responses","insult characteristics","serial biomarkers","unique insights","high comorbidity burden","mean age","years","admission","half","older males","chronic critical illness","skin","survivors","soft tissue","source control","pneumonia","best","previous studies","BACKGROUND","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","ICU"],"language":"en"},

METHODS: This is a prospective observational multicenter study conducted across 18 countries in Europe and Israel. Admission characteristics, clinical data, and outcome were described at patient- and center levels. Between-center variation in the total ICU population was quantified with the median odds ratio (MOR), with correction for case-mix and random variation between centers. RESULTS: A total of 2138 patients were admitted to the ICU, with median age of 49 years; 36% of which were mild TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale; GCS 13\u201315). Within, 72 h 636 (30%) were discharged and 128 (6%) died. Early deaths and long-stay patients (\u003E 72 h) had more severe injuries based on the GCS and neuroimaging characteristics, compared with short-stay patients. Long-stay patients received more monitoring and were treated at higher intensity, and experienced worse 6-month outcome compared to short-stay patients. Between-center variations were prominent in the proportion of short-stay patients (MOR = 2.3, p \u003C 0.001), use of intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring (MOR = 2.5, p \u003C 0.001) and aggressive treatments (MOR = 2.9, p \u003C 0.001); and smaller in 6-month outcome (MOR = 1.2, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Half of contemporary TBI patients at the ICU have mild to moderate head injury. Substantial between-center variations exist in ICU stay and treatment policies, and less so in outcome.

Following the 2009 pandemic, there was widened interest in studying influenza burden in all regions. However, since data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remain limited, we aimed to contribute to the understanding of influenza burden in Lebanon. METHODS: A retrospective chart review extending over a period of 8 seasons from Jan 1st, 2008 till June 30th, 2016 at a tertiary care center in Beirut was performed. All cases confirmed to have influenza based on rapid antigen detection or/and polymerase chain reaction on a respiratory sample were included for analysis. Data on epidemiology, clinical presentation, complications, antiviral use and mortality were collected for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1829 cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza were identified. Average annual positivity rate was 14% (positive tests over total requested). Both influenza A and B co-circulated in each season with predominance of influenza A. Influenza virus started circulating in December and peaked in January and February. The age group of 19\u201350 years accounted for the largest proportion of cases (22.5%) followed by the age group of 5\u201319 years (18%). Pneumonia was the most common complication reported in 33% of cases. Mortality reached 3.8%. The two extremes of age (\u003C 2 years and \u2265 65 years) were associated with a more severe course of disease, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, complications, and mortality rate. Of all the identified cases, 26% were hospitalized. Moderate-to-severe disease was more likely in influenza B cases but no difference in mortality was reported between the two types. Antivirals were prescribed in 68.8% and antibiotics in 41% of cases. There seemed to be an increasing trend in the number of diagnosed and hospitalized cases over the years of the study. CONCLUSION: Patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza at our center had a high rate of hospitalization and mortality. A population based prospective surveillance study is needed to better estimate the burden of Influenza in Lebanon that would help formulate a policy on influenza control.","publish_time":"2020-05-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"Assaf-Casals, Aia; Saleh, Zeina; Khafaja, Sarah; Fayad, Danielle; Ezzeddine, Hady; Saleh, Mohammad; Chamseddine, Sarah; Sayegh, Rouba; Sharara, Sima L.; Chmaisse, Ahmad; Kanj, Souha S.; Kanafani, Zeina; Hanna-Wakim, Rima; Araj, George F.; Mahfouz, Rami; Saito, Reiko; Suzuki, Hiroshi; Zaraket, Hassan; Dbaibo, Ghassan S.","journal":"BMC Infect Dis","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/b46ad640832bc15ab11ee484913be383ac7039a2.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7216128.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7216128/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEyLmNzdjs0ODM1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1289518,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:35:55Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"smSdiglX/DJ13\u002Bg5I8P9aw==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_12.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":["Pneumonia"],"organizations":["World Health Organization"],"locations":["Middle East","North Africa","Beirut","Lebanon"],"keyphrases":["burden of Influenza","influenza B cases","predominance of influenza","Influenza virus","influenza control","understanding of influenza burden","cases of laboratory","years","hospitalized cases","identified cases","mortality rate","largest proportion of cases","age group","complications","high rate of hospitalization","severe disease","data","total","Lebanon","analysis","extremes of age","severe course of disease","tertiary care center","Average annual positivity rate","intensive care unit","B co-circulated","prospective surveillance study","admission","Middle East","MENA","polymerase chain reaction","clinical presentation","ICU","North Africa","antiviral use","respiratory sample","rapid antigen detection","World Health Organization","major cause of morbidity","positive tests","period","retrospective chart review","epidemiology","number","difference","METHODS","population","Beirut","BACKGROUND","policy","Patients","common complication","Pneumonia","increasing trend","CONCLUSION","RESULTS","regions","seasons","pandemic","types","antibiotics","Antivirals"],"language":"en"},

All animals belonged to a herd located in the mountains of the Le\u00F3n province (NW Spain). Rotaviruses were found in 18 out of 63 goat kid fecal samples but no significant association between shedding of rotavirus and presence of diarrhea could be established. Rotaviruses were found in kids aged 6 to 21 days, and more frequently between 6 and 10 days. No shedding of virus was detected in any of the adults. Considering ELISA as the reference test, PAGE and both latex agglutination tests were less sensitive. One of the latex tests was also highly non-specific. All PAGE-positive samples showed the typical electropherotype of group A rotavirus. Feces were also screened for other pathogens including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Cryptosporidium parvum. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of six out of 45 goat kids tested, all six suffering from diarrhea. This paper represents the first description of rotavirus infections in goats in Spain.

Here, we evaluated whether HBV RNA could act as an early monitor of pegylated interferon responses. METHODS: We analyzed a phase 3, multicenter, randomized cohort of 727 HBeAg-positive non-cirrhotic patients receiving a 48-week treatment of PegIFN\u03B1-2a or PegIFN\u03B1-2b and a 24-week treatment-free follow-up. Serum levels of HBV RNA, HBV DNA, HBeAg, and HBsAg were measured at weeks 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72. RESULTS: HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss at week 72 were observed in 217 (29.8%) and 21 (2.9%) patients, respectively. During the 48-week treatment, HBV RNA decreased more rapidly than HBV DNA and HBsAg, but HBV RNA and HBeAg shared similar dynamics with positive correlations. Multivariate regression analyses consistently revealed the significance of HBV RNA at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 48 to monitor HBeAg seroconversion but not HBsAg loss. Although baseline HBV RNA only showed a modest AUC performance, HBV RNA with a significant increase of AUC at week 12 outperformed other HBV biomarkers to forecast HBeAg seroconversion (p value \u003C 0.05). HBV RNA \u2264 1000 copies/mL was an optimized cutoff at week 12 that offered better prediction than other HBV biomarkers. This optimized cutoff plus patient age, HBV genotype B, and HBeAg offered a strong estimation of HBeAg seroconversion (accuracy 95.2%, true negative rate 99.8%). CONCLUSION: HBV RNA at week 12 is an effective monitor of HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients treated with pegylated interferons.

HAP2/GCS1, a TBV candidate, is critical for fertilization in Plasmodium. Here, the genetic diversity of PvHAP2 was studied in Plasmodium vivax parasite populations from the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). METHODS: Plasmodium vivax clinical isolates were collected in clinics from the China-Myanmar border region (135 samples), western Thailand (41 samples) and western Myanmar (51 samples). Near full-length Pvhap2 (nucleotides 13\u20132574) was amplified and sequenced from these isolates. Molecular evolution studies were conducted to evaluate the genetic diversity, selection and population differentiation. RESULTS: Sequencing of the pvhap2 gene for a total of 227 samples from the three P. vivax populations revealed limited genetic diversity of this gene in the GMS (\u03C0 = 0.00036 \u00B1 0.00003), with the highest \u03C0 value observed in Myanmar (0.00053 \u00B1 0.00009). Y133S was the dominant mutation in the China-Myanmar border (99.26%), Myanmar (100%) and Thailand (95.12%). Results of all neutrality tests were negative for all the three populations, suggesting the possible action of purifying selection. Codon-based tests identified specific codons which are under purifying or positive selections. Wright\u2019s fixation index showed low to moderate genetic differentiation of P. vivax populations in the GMS, with F(ST) ranging from 0.04077 to 0.24833, whereas high levels of genetic differentiation were detected between the China-Myanmar border and Iran populations (F(ST) = 0.60266), and between Thailand and Iran populations (F(ST) = 0.44161). A total of 20 haplotypes were identified, with H2 being the abundant haplotype in China-Myanmar border, Myanmar and Thailand populations. Epitope mapping prediction of Pvhap2 antigen showed that high-score B-cell epitopes are located in the S307-G324, L429-P453 and V623-D637 regions. The E317K and D637N mutations located within S307-G324 and V623-D637 epitopes slightly reduced the predicted score for potential epitopes. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a very low level of genetic diversity of pvhap2 gene among P. vivax populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The relative conservation of pvhap2 supports further evaluation of a Pvhap2-based TBV.

This study determined patterns of drug-resistance mutations (DRMs) among HIV-1 isolates from patients receiving first-line ART in South-eastern Nigeria. Blood samples were collected from HIV-1 infected patients accessing antiretroviral treatment centers at General Hospital Awo-Omamma, Imo state, State Hospital Asaba, Delta state and St Joseph\u2019s Catholic Hospital Adazi, Anambra state and used for HIV-1 DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. DRMs were scored using combination of Stanford algorithm and the 2015 International Antiviral Society-USA list while drug susceptibility was predicted using Stanford algorithm. Twenty eight of the HIV-1 isolates were sequenced and identified as subtypes G (35.7%), CRF02_AG (57.1%) and unclassifiable, U(G) (7.1%). Major PI resistance-associated mutations were identified at two sites including M46L (16.7% of subtype G/U(G)) and V82L (6.3% of CRF02_AG). Minor PI resistance-associated mutations identified among subtype G/U(G) are L10V/I (8.3%) and K20I (100%) while L10V/I (50%), K20I (100%), L33F (6.3%) and N88D (6.3%) were identified among CRF02_AG. Other polymorphisms found include; I13V/A, E35Q, M36I/L, N37D/S/E/H, R57K/G, L63T/P/S/Q, C67E/S, H69K/R, K70R, V82I and L89M in the range of 28.6% to 100% among the different subtypes. Interpretation based on Stanford algorithm showed that Darunavir/ritonavir is the only regimen whose potency was not compromised by the circulating mutations. Identification of major and minor PI resistance mutations in this study underscores the need for drug resistance testing prior to initiation of second line antiretroviral therapy in Nigeria.","publish_time":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","authors":"Udeze, Augustine O.; Olaleye, David O.; Odaibo, Georgina N.","journal":"PLoS One","pdf_json_files":"document_parses/pdf_json/a8224fcc0483df4731f4eac97d7f1d6ce1bcbe40.json","pmc_json_files":"document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7141668.xml.json","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141668/","AzureSearch_DocumentKey":"aHR0cHM6Ly9jb3ZpZDE5Y3N2LmJsb2IuY29yZS53aW5kb3dzLm5ldC9jc3ZsYXJnZS9tZXRhZGF0YS1jbGVhbmVkXzEwLmNzdjsyNjU1","metadata_storage_content_type":"application/vnd.ms-excel","metadata_storage_size":1103156,"metadata_storage_last_modified":"2020-12-26T14:34:50Z","metadata_storage_content_md5":"R1Pr7Es\u002B9Mq4Avl\u002BbF/uGQ==","metadata_storage_name":"metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_path":"https://covid19csv.blob.core.windows.net/csvlarge/metadata-cleaned_10.csv","metadata_storage_file_extension":".csv","people":[],"organizations":["PI","S/E/H, R57K/G, L63T/P/S/Q","Stanford"],"locations":["Nigeria"],"keyphrases":["HIV","subtype G","subtypes G","Acquisition of resistance mutations","minor PI resistance mutations","Minor PI resistance-associated mutations","Major PI resistance-associated mutations","circulating mutations","drug resistance testing","isolates","CRF02","AG","State Hospital Asaba","Delta state","Imo state","Anambra state","infected patients","line antiretroviral therapy","combination of Stanford algorithm","antiretroviral treatment centers","drug susceptibility","patterns of drug","study","line ART","DRMs","L10V","K20I","General Hospital Awo-Omamma","treatment failure","Identification of major","South-eastern Nigeria","different subtypes","St Joseph\u2019s Catholic Hospital Adazi","initiation","International Antiviral Society-USA list","H69K","C67E","R57K","L63T","need","V82I","N37D","K70R","ritonavir","L89M","M36I","DNA sequencing","Darunavir","phylogenetic analysis","I13V","potency","E35Q","regimen","sites","M46L","V82L","range","L33F","Blood samples","Interpretation","N88D","polymorphisms"],"language":"en"},

There are over 200 known microbial, chemical, and physical agents that are known to cause foodborne illness.

Several commonly used approaches to control foodborne pathogens include antibiotics, natural antimicrobials, bacteriophages, bacteriocins, ionizing radiations, and heat. In addition, probiotics offer a potential intervention strategy for the prevention and control of foodborne infections. This review focuses on the use of probiotics and bioengineered probiotics to control foodborne pathogens, their antimicrobial actions, and their delivery strategies.

The majority of deaths were in young birds up to 10 kg body weight. Avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) were isolated from 14 pools of organ tissues representing seven groups each of three or four ostriches, which died over the first 3 weeks. The AIVs were detected in respiratory tissues, kidneys and intestines. All were subtype H5N2. The intravenous pathogenicity index of each isolate for chickens was 0.0 and the four isolates examined each had the amino acid sequence -P-Q-R-E-T-R*G-L-F- at the cleavage site of the haemagglutinin protein, typical of non-pathogenic AIVs. In addition, an avirulent avian paramyxovirus type 1 virus was isolated from one pool of kidney tissues. Bacteriological examination gave no significant results. The most characteristic pathological findings were impaction of the proventriculus and gizzard, enteritis with stasis and multi-focal necrotic hepatitis.","publish_time":"2007-11-12T00:00:00Z","authors":"J\u00F8rgensen, P.
